00:47.680 --> 00:53.676
You must remember, young thespians,
learning is never seasonal.

00:54.021 --> 00:59.778
So, do allow the shimmering lights
of summer to refresh and illuminate

01:00.110 --> 01:02.670
- your fertile young minds.
- What's she talking about?

01:02.863 --> 01:06.697
The future greets you
with its magic mirror,

01:06.951 --> 01:13.186
reflecting each golden moment,
each emboldened choice.

01:13.541 --> 01:16.055
Dude, Miss Darbus
has snapped her cap.

01:16.251 --> 01:18.401
Dude, you're actually listening?

01:20.172 --> 01:21.491
Yes, Jason.

01:22.175 --> 01:25.485
So, what was your favourite
summer memory, Miss Darbus?

01:25.885 --> 01:30.356
Summers have passed fleetingly
since I was your age,

01:30.642 --> 01:33.793
but I remember each
with poignant clarity.

01:35.104 --> 01:37.413
Summer. Summer.

01:38.774 --> 01:39.968
Summer.

01:40.693 --> 01:41.842
Summer.

01:42.362 --> 01:45.595
- Summer.
- Summer.

01:45.824 --> 01:47.860
- Summer. Summer.
- Ashland Shakespeare Festival of...

01:48.034 --> 01:51.504
- Summer. Summer. Summer.
- ... '88 leaps fondly to mind.

No, but seriously, guys,
this summer I gotta make bank.

05:24.757 --> 05:27.112
My parents keep talking about
how much college is gonna cost.

05:27.301 --> 05:28.859
Yeah, my folks are gonna match
whatever I make,

05:29.012 --> 05:30.081
but I gotta get hired first.

05:30.221 --> 05:32.451
Me, too. I'm saving up for a car,

05:33.098 --> 05:36.215
so I can take that little hottie
on a proper date.

05:38.270 --> 05:39.589
Gabriella.

05:40.273 --> 05:43.948
I understand you've moved
every summer for the past five years,

05:44.778 --> 05:47.975
and I'd hate to think today is goodbye.

05:48.198 --> 05:52.032
No worries. My mom promised
I'm here until graduation next year.

05:52.785 --> 05:54.616
Bless Mom's little heart.

05:54.788 --> 05:58.383
Sharpay, we got off to a rough start,
but you really came through.

05:58.626 --> 06:00.059
I mean, you helped me
with the winter musical.

06:00.210 --> 06:01.359
I did?

06:01.795 --> 06:03.626
Those vocal exercises?

06:07.551 --> 06:08.745
See you.

06:09.469 --> 06:11.460
Gabriella and I have
had, like, five job interviews,

06:11.637 --> 06:13.468
but we keep getting beat out
by college kids.

06:13.640 --> 06:16.837
Yeah, same here. I guess I'm back
in the babysitting business.

06:17.060 --> 06:18.288
Hey, Martha. Hey, Taylor.

06:18.437 --> 06:20.667
Hey, Kelsi, what are you planning
to do this summer?

06:20.856 --> 06:22.733
Grow, write music. Grow.

06:32.159 --> 06:34.548
Your summer activities consultant
has arrived.

06:34.746 --> 06:37.135
Hopefully some of those activities
will include a job.

06:37.331 --> 06:41.244
Hey, whatever happens, as long
as we're together, it's cool, right?

06:41.669 --> 06:43.022
You promise?

06:43.922 --> 06:45.275
Here's my promise.

06:58.938 --> 07:02.772
- "T" as in Troy?
- Well, I... Yeah.

07:06.779 --> 07:10.738
Hey, man, how's it going?
There you go, boss.

07:12.244 --> 07:14.758
Hoops. Let's go.

07:14.953 --> 07:18.309
Yeah, sure, sure.
We're not busy or anything. Let's go.

07:19.833 --> 07:22.393
We could go to the movies,
download music.

07:22.586 --> 07:24.861
Oh, I'm definitely teaching you
a twisted-flip on the skateboard.

07:25.047 --> 07:27.800
Oh, and I have first-aid training,
so I can patch myself up afterwards.

07:28.010 --> 07:29.284
All right!

07:32.138 --> 07:34.288
"Going to movies, listening to music.

07:34.473 --> 07:37.385
"And, golly, Troy,
I have first-aid training. "

07:38.102 --> 07:39.296
Oh, please.

07:39.772 --> 07:42.570
Oh. Come here, Kelsi.
I have a summer job for you.

07:42.775 --> 07:43.924
At our country club.

07:44.066 --> 07:46.660
Our rehearsal pianist
is evidently moving.

07:46.862 --> 07:47.977
Or hiding.

07:48.112 --> 07:49.989
- Pardon?
- Sounds great.

07:51.491 --> 07:52.890
Cheer up, Shar, it's summer.

07:53.034 --> 07:55.423
We can do whatever we want to.
Everything changes.

07:55.622 --> 07:57.931
Ryan, who's the absolute primo boy
at East High?

07:58.124 --> 08:02.242
I'd say Troy Bolton has that category
pretty much locked up, don't you think?

08:02.503 --> 08:04.539
And East High's primo girl?

08:07.590 --> 08:11.026
- Just answer the question!
- Gosh, you?

08:12.680 --> 08:18.550
Troy, Sharpay.
Sharpay, Troy. Sharpay...

08:18.895 --> 08:20.214
Shar.

08:20.355 --> 08:22.823
- It just makes sense.
- Evidently not to Troy.

08:23.024 --> 08:27.575
But it's summer, Ry.
Everything changes.

I didn't see last season.

09:22.085 --> 09:23.154
Wildcats!

09:34.388 --> 09:36.185
This is Thomas Fulton,
General Manager

09:36.350 --> 09:38.341
of Lava Springs Country Club
here in Albuquerque.

09:38.518 --> 09:40.907
I understand you've been looking
for summer work.

09:41.103 --> 09:43.173
Hey, Troy, does Gabriella
still remember your name,

09:43.355 --> 09:46.427
or did she find somebody new
to karaoke with this summer?

09:46.652 --> 09:49.564
That sounds fantastic, Mr Fulton.
But how did you get my name?

09:49.780 --> 09:51.930
Well, we've always had
a student summer work programme

09:52.115 --> 09:55.266
here at Lava Springs.
So, are you ready?

09:55.910 --> 10:00.745
Here's the thing. I know the most
amazing girl... I mean, student.

10:01.042 --> 10:03.033
Straight A's, quintuple straight A's,

10:03.209 --> 10:06.246
and it would be
so amazingly perfect if...

10:06.464 --> 10:07.738
Man, he's really working someone.

10:07.882 --> 10:10.919
It can't be Gabriella.
Whenever she calls, he just blushes.

10:11.135 --> 10:12.250
Yeah, I never said that.

10:12.387 --> 10:13.456
Yes!

10:15.181 --> 10:19.094
- What's up, dog?
- Nothing. Nothing. Nothing!

10:19.936 --> 10:22.689
Okay. I'll tell you what,
you guys stick together this summer,

10:22.897 --> 10:24.569
you work on the game,
and we are talking back-to-back

10:24.731 --> 10:26.926
- championships next fall.
- Yeah!

10:29.362 --> 10:32.798
Can we all redirect this energy
by carrying in the groceries?

10:33.032 --> 10:34.306
- Yes, Mrs Bolton.
- Yes, Mrs Bolton.

10:35.409 --> 10:38.401
Hey, we're kicking off another
hot summer here in Albuquerque.

10:38.622 --> 10:40.852
So, for those cool enough
to have a convertible,

10:41.041 --> 10:43.680
crank up the sound,
breathe that fresh air,

10:43.877 --> 10:47.028
and say hello to summer!

11:08.735 --> 11:11.454
Miss Evans, Mr Evans,
looking very sharp this summer.

11:11.655 --> 11:13.008
Welcome back to Lava Springs.

11:13.158 --> 11:14.796
Thank you, Charles.

11:16.120 --> 11:17.439
Hi, boy!

11:19.831 --> 11:21.822
Oh, can you find
some shade for my car?

11:22.001 --> 11:24.720
- Even if we have to plant a tree.
- Fulton.

11:24.920 --> 11:27.070
And may I say, welcome back.

11:28.255 --> 11:30.007
It's good to be home.

11:35.388 --> 11:36.457
Are the flyers ready?

11:36.599 --> 11:40.194
This year we embossed the flyers
for the show.

11:40.435 --> 11:41.709
Inspired.

11:43.314 --> 11:46.306
I plan to limit member talent
auditions to 30 seconds each.

11:46.859 --> 11:48.577
Amateur performers are very...

11:48.735 --> 11:49.884
- Draining?
- Yes.

11:50.154 --> 11:51.667
Understood.

11:51.823 --> 11:53.381
And should I...

11:53.533 --> 11:58.129
We be so fortunate as to win
the Star Dazzle Award again.

11:59.539 --> 12:00.608
But where would we put it?

12:00.749 --> 12:02.819
We're planning on expanding
the trophy case.

12:03.001 --> 12:05.037
The designs are in my office.

12:05.210 --> 12:07.849
- Fulton, you are so efficient.
- Well...

12:09.424 --> 12:11.415
The staffing matter we discussed?

12:11.718 --> 12:14.551
Done. With discretion.

12:15.806 --> 12:17.034
Fabulous.

12:18.225 --> 12:21.183
- Oh, stop it. Yes. Yes.
- Ryan!

12:25.230 --> 12:26.948
- Sharpay!
- Girls.

12:27.109 --> 12:29.179
Your chaise in its usual spot,
Miss Evans?

12:29.360 --> 12:30.395
Thank you, Javier.

12:30.528 --> 12:31.881
Emma, Jackie and Lea, east of me.

12:32.030 --> 12:35.466
Oh, and you'll be a prince to angle our
chaises on the hour, as the sun moves.

12:35.702 --> 12:37.852
Well, thanks to the kind words
from your mother last season,

12:38.037 --> 12:39.436
I've been promoted.

12:39.580 --> 12:42.413
But, no worries,
I'll make sure that the new lifeguard

12:42.624 --> 12:45.457
is fully briefed
on just how you like things.

12:47.755 --> 12:51.145
So, what's the theme of
the summer talent show, Sharpay?

12:52.133 --> 12:54.124
- Redemption.
- Love it.

12:55.303 --> 12:58.261
It was a very trying year, ladies.

12:58.932 --> 13:01.241
My drama department

13:01.435 --> 13:05.269
singers coming from the chemistry lab
and locker room. Shocking, really.

13:05.522 --> 13:09.720
Sis, we've got the pool, the entire club,
and the whole summer to enjoy it.

13:09.986 --> 13:11.738
And the spa has been redone.

13:11.904 --> 13:15.658
There's a guacamole facial and
a seaweed body scrub on the menu.

13:15.909 --> 13:17.900
What could be more fabulous?

13:19.122 --> 13:20.271
- More ice.
- Right away, Miss Evans.

Yeah!

16:48.128 --> 16:50.767
I got you. I got you. It's okay.

16:54.383 --> 16:57.102
- What are you doing here?
- I'm the new lifeguard.

16:57.721 --> 17:00.474
Wait, are you a member here?

17:11.068 --> 17:15.300
I told you to hire Troy Bolton,
not the entire East High student body!

17:15.571 --> 17:20.281
You told me to hire Troy Bolton.
"Whatever it takes. "

17:21.119 --> 17:23.917
Well, why didn't you warn me
about the rest of them?

17:24.123 --> 17:27.957
I did discuss the matter
with the Lava Springs board, of course.

17:29.753 --> 17:31.903
The board. You mean, our...

17:32.090 --> 17:33.125
Mother!

17:39.013 --> 17:42.210
Gabriella Montez and the Wildcats?
Mother, how could you?

17:42.433 --> 17:44.105
Think of your future, kitten.

17:44.267 --> 17:48.021
These are your school chums,
not the fuddy-duddy Lava Springs staff.

17:48.274 --> 17:50.310
These are not my chums!

17:51.609 --> 17:53.759
They'll steal my talent show.

17:53.944 --> 17:57.254
And what fresh talent
you'll have for your summer show.

17:57.782 --> 18:00.421
Mother, did you hear what I just said?

18:03.706 --> 18:05.458
Ryan, talk to Mother.

18:06.207 --> 18:09.119
- Hi, Mom.
- Ducky! How's my dashing boy?

18:16.509 --> 18:19.626
Tell pumpkin if she worries too much,
she'll get frown lines.

18:21.932 --> 18:23.047
Namaste.

18:28.521 --> 18:30.989
- I want them out!
- But your mother specifically said...

18:31.191 --> 18:33.944
Oh, don't mention
that backstabbing yogini to me!

18:34.152 --> 18:37.030
If you can't fire them,
make them wanna quit.

18:43.620 --> 18:45.656
I'm hoping Chef Michael's
gonna teach me

18:45.831 --> 18:47.901
the art of Austrian flake pastry.

18:48.083 --> 18:51.041
And Sharpay's gonna be
where I work every day.

18:51.253 --> 18:54.325
How much better can summer get?
Right? Right?

18:54.550 --> 18:56.780
- A real dream come true.
- If you actually get to know her,

18:56.968 --> 18:58.037
- I mean she's...
- Dude.

18:58.178 --> 19:00.692
Hey, I didn't even know
Sharpay's parents owned this place.

19:00.889 --> 19:01.924
Mr Fulton just said, you know,

19:02.057 --> 19:04.969
there's Wildcat fans at Lava Springs,
and jobs are available.

19:05.185 --> 19:06.413
So, I said let's go for it.

19:06.561 --> 19:09.997
Inspiring, Mr Bolton. Truly inspiring.

19:10.231 --> 19:12.108
However, what we're looking for
from all of you,

19:12.275 --> 19:15.984
is not inspiration, but perspiration.

19:17.741 --> 19:22.735
Confirming assignments.
Bolton, Danforth, waiters.

19:23.662 --> 19:26.335
And, when needed, caddies.

19:28.333 --> 19:29.322
What?

19:29.627 --> 19:32.619
Miss McKessie,
I'm told that you're efficient.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.635
- Well...
- Prove it.

19:34.800 --> 19:38.588
You'll handle member activities.
Keep me in sight at all times.

19:38.844 --> 19:43.554
Kelsi, piano.
Lunchtime and cocktail hour.

19:43.850 --> 19:48.128
That means mood music,
not new music.

19:48.605 --> 19:49.594
Capisce?

19:49.731 --> 19:53.246
Martha, chopping, cutting,
preparing plates.

19:53.485 --> 19:55.760
Do complete the summer
with the equal amount of digits

19:55.945 --> 19:58.220
I assume you currently possess.

19:58.407 --> 20:02.195
Oh, Zeke, you will assist Chef Michael
in the...

20:02.453 --> 20:03.772
The promised land.

20:03.914 --> 20:05.108
You hold on to that.

20:05.246 --> 20:06.804
Mr Fulton, Your Excellency, sir,

20:06.958 --> 20:10.951
would it be okay if we draw straws
to see who has to wait on Sharpay?

20:11.211 --> 20:14.283
Please, none of you
will be waiting on Sharpay.

20:14.507 --> 20:15.781
Oh, yes. Snap.

20:15.924 --> 20:18.882
- You will be serving Miss Evans.
- Who's that?

20:20.512 --> 20:24.425
Always address our members as Mr,
Mrs, or Miss. Let's practise.

20:24.683 --> 20:26.321
- Do we have to?
- Shall we?

20:26.477 --> 20:29.549
"Miss Evans,
would you care for lemonade?"

20:29.771 --> 20:32.808
Actually, I'm not Miss Evans. I'm Jason.

20:36.820 --> 20:38.936
- It smells so good and I am so hungry.
- No, wait. You don't...

20:39.116 --> 20:40.105
- No, no, no.
- What's for lunch?

20:40.240 --> 20:41.593
Miss Montez.

20:42.035 --> 20:45.744
It would seem your lunch break
does not start for 3.5 minutes.

20:46.330 --> 20:49.049
I do hope no members drowned
in your absence.

20:49.250 --> 20:53.209
Henceforth, do clock in
and out on time.

20:53.463 --> 20:58.253
Three infractions of any kind,
and your employment is terminated.

20:59.011 --> 21:00.205
Capisce?

21:01.972 --> 21:03.564
Chop, chop, chop.

21:04.849 --> 21:07.158
- Okay, that man officially scares me.
- Yeah.

21:07.352 --> 21:10.071
Suddenly, I'm beginning to miss
detention with Miss Darbus.

21:10.271 --> 21:11.101
- How sick is that?
- Come on.

21:12.691 --> 21:15.330
We got a hoop out back,
two free meals a day,

21:15.529 --> 21:17.679
and we only have to wear
these stupid outfits on duty.

21:17.862 --> 21:20.137
All for one, and one for all. All right?

21:20.323 --> 21:23.759
- This is our summer. Now, what team?
- Wildcats!

21:23.994 --> 21:25.473
- What team?
- Wildcats!

21:25.621 --> 21:26.656
Come on.

24:26.224 --> 24:27.418
Send the waiters right in.

24:45.492 --> 24:48.564
Miss me? Of course you did.

24:48.997 --> 24:51.511
Hey, you ever been on a golf course?

24:51.708 --> 24:54.984
We're employees, Troy. Not members.
And I don't play golf.

24:55.212 --> 24:57.328
Who said anything about golf?

25:02.552 --> 25:04.270
Are you sure it's okay for us
to be out here?

25:04.429 --> 25:07.023
Yeah, unless the jackrabbits turn us in.

25:09.184 --> 25:10.503
So, how's kitchen duty?

25:10.644 --> 25:14.603
Oh, you know, the team that
washes dishes together, wins together.

25:17.651 --> 25:20.040
My mom said summer jobs look good
on college applications.

25:20.238 --> 25:23.514
All part of the frightening concept
called "our future. "

25:23.741 --> 25:25.254
Are you worried?

25:26.160 --> 25:28.720
Hey, college costs a fortune.

25:29.790 --> 25:32.179
My parents are saving pennies,
unlike the people at this place.

25:32.375 --> 25:33.649
You're a cinch for a scholarship.

25:33.793 --> 25:37.308
I'm only as good as whatever happens
next season. It's...

25:37.546 --> 25:40.344
I always liked the idea of
being in charge of my future,

25:40.551 --> 25:41.870
until it actually started happening.

25:42.011 --> 25:44.479
So, let's just think about right now,

25:44.678 --> 25:47.954
because I've never been in one place
for an entire summer,

25:48.183 --> 25:51.653
and this means a lot to me,
especially being here with...

25:51.895 --> 25:55.854
Such an outstanding peanut-butter
and-jelly-sandwich maker like me?

25:56.276 --> 25:58.744
I want to remember this summer, Troy.

25:59.986 --> 26:03.023
- Here, catch.
- Oh, I love this game.

26:03.907 --> 26:05.499
- Ready?
- Go.

26:07.579 --> 26:11.128
- Beautiful.
- Very nice! Oh. Your turn.

26:15.585 --> 26:17.382
- You didn't catch a single one of them.
- You...

26:17.547 --> 26:19.105
That was so bad.

26:21.634 --> 26:24.228
Fulton, when I was
on the fourth fairway today,

26:24.428 --> 26:26.578
it seemed bone dry.

26:27.016 --> 26:28.369
Oh, no way!

26:30.476 --> 26:34.071
Could you tell maintenance
to give it a little extra splash?

26:49.037 --> 26:50.311
No way!

26:53.209 --> 26:56.167
- May I have this dance?
- Why, of course you may.

26:56.379 --> 26:57.937
Let's go then.

27:00.674 --> 27:03.905
You are gonna get so wet!

27:07.265 --> 27:08.300
Yeah!

27:13.021 --> 27:15.535
Keep an eye on them tomorrow
and keep me posted.

27:15.731 --> 27:16.800
Why are you smiling?

27:16.941 --> 27:20.900
No worries, Ryan.
This is our turf, remember?

27:22.072 --> 27:26.031
First a break-time infraction,
now frolicking on the golf course.

27:27.326 --> 27:30.955
We are not off to an auspicious start,
are we, Miss Montez?

27:31.206 --> 27:32.525
Actually, Mr Fulton, this was my idea,
so she's...

27:32.664 --> 27:35.497
How gallant, but irrelevant.

27:36.044 --> 27:38.842
We won't allow this to happen again,
will we?

27:45.387 --> 27:46.422
Good morning, everybody.

27:46.556 --> 27:47.545
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

27:47.682 --> 27:49.513
- Smells good. That smells good.
- Hey, Martha.

27:49.683 --> 27:51.355
- Hey.
- Hey, Jason.

28:02.322 --> 28:03.801
- Hey, morning.
- What's up?

28:04.115 --> 28:08.393
♪ Yeah ♪
♪ You are the music in me ♪

28:08.662 --> 28:11.176
-Sounding good, Kels.
-Thanks.

28:11.372 --> 28:13.840
Actually, I need to go get ready
for the ladies' luncheon.

28:14.041 --> 28:16.157
Won't exactly be rocking out.

28:16.837 --> 28:19.431
You know, I am so excited
about the club's talent show.

28:19.631 --> 28:21.269
I mean, the employees
get to do a number,

28:21.425 --> 28:23.143
and I have ideas for everyone.

28:23.301 --> 28:24.370
You guys can sing the lead,

28:24.511 --> 28:25.864
and maybe Zeke and Chad
can do backup,

28:26.011 --> 28:27.126
and everyone can dance.

28:27.264 --> 28:28.583
Big timeout on that one.

28:28.724 --> 28:31.841
My singing career began and ended
with the East High Winter Musical.

28:32.059 --> 28:34.448
I'm just here to make a cheque
and sneak in the pool after work.

28:34.646 --> 28:36.398
That's... That's really it.

28:38.359 --> 28:39.872
What was that
you were playing a minute ago?

28:40.026 --> 28:41.744
Oh, it's... It's nothing. It's just nothing.

28:41.902 --> 28:42.971
What's this?

28:43.111 --> 28:45.341
Well, I was thinking
if you'd do the show,

28:45.531 --> 28:49.729
that I wanted to be ready,
and I wrote this for you guys.

28:49.996 --> 28:50.906

32:22.213 --> 32:26.172
Oh, I've got the talent show sign-up
sheet right here. Are you in?

32:29.471 --> 32:34.147
Maybe we can work this out,
but only if we're all in this together.

32:34.435 --> 32:36.107
Yeah!

32:36.270 --> 32:37.783
This is going to be fantastic.

32:37.937 --> 32:40.576
I'm going to coordinate rehearsal
to coincide with all of our schedules.

32:40.775 --> 32:44.085
Goldenthroat, this is Jazz Square.
We may have trouble.

32:45.280 --> 32:48.829
Now, it's an amazing song,
but Kelsi didn't write it for us.

32:49.075 --> 32:50.144
Hi, Mom.

32:50.284 --> 32:52.195
- Seaweed scrub, darling?
- Maybe later.

32:52.371 --> 32:55.886
Ryan, it might be wonderful
if Troy participates in our talent show.

32:56.123 --> 32:58.318
What? If he sings with Gabriella

32:58.501 --> 33:01.140
then our whole show is going to be
the "Troy and Gabriella Show. "

33:01.338 --> 33:03.294
I'm not certain Gabriella
is ideally suited

33:03.464 --> 33:06.820
to help Troy realise his full potential
at Lava Springs.

33:07.051 --> 33:08.803
Mommy, what time
is Daddy gonna be here?

33:08.970 --> 33:11.040
We tee off at noon. Join us?

33:11.890 --> 33:13.039
Love to.

33:16.562 --> 33:19.076
Up. And how shall
we get to the food today, sir?

33:19.272 --> 33:21.627
- I don't know, perhaps skipping.
- Very well then.

33:21.816 --> 33:23.169
Shall we?

33:23.319 --> 33:26.709
Hipty scouty, hipty skipty,
hipty skipty, hipty skipty...

33:26.946 --> 33:30.416
Danforth, Bolton,
you're caddying today.

33:30.660 --> 33:32.412
$40 a bag. You've been requested.

33:32.577 --> 33:34.010
- What?
- By who?

33:34.163 --> 33:36.916
Dude, who cares?
For $40, I'd caddy for Godzilla.

33:37.123 --> 33:38.761
Close, very close.

33:39.917 --> 33:41.236
Thank you.

33:41.712 --> 33:43.430
- Thanks.
- Thanks, man.

33:47.968 --> 33:51.802
Hey, boys! So, Troy, I thought
it was time for you to meet my parents.

33:54.058 --> 33:55.093
Enchantee.

33:55.226 --> 33:56.864
- Awesome.
- Hi.

33:57.228 --> 33:58.263
Hello.

33:58.397 --> 34:00.149
So, where's your dad?

34:15.038 --> 34:16.391
Hi, Daddy!

34:18.206 --> 34:21.358
Where's the first tee
and what's the course record?

34:27.801 --> 34:30.395
I'm just kidding. I built the course
myself and I hold the record,

34:30.594 --> 34:32.745
but who's counting? Princess.

34:34.099 --> 34:37.648
- Son, you've been working out.
- Yoga.

34:39.020 --> 34:41.773
Bring that around, there you go.
Quite a season you boys had.

34:41.983 --> 34:44.417
Oh, Troy played
for the golf team, too, Daddy.

34:44.610 --> 34:47.681
Oh, versatile. How about you, son?

34:47.905 --> 34:50.179
- Baseball. Track and field.
- Outstanding.

34:50.366 --> 34:53.641
Might come in handy the way
I play golf. Fair warning.

34:57.458 --> 34:58.652
Fore!

35:03.003 --> 35:05.597
- Brilliant, darling. Brilliant.
- Lovely.

35:06.091 --> 35:10.562
Chad, you'll be caddying for Mother.
Troy, Daddy.

35:12.265 --> 35:13.380
Daddy.

35:14.683 --> 35:16.002
Bravo!

35:16.141 --> 35:18.211
Brilliant. Let's take a walk.

35:18.519 --> 35:21.079
- Is that a new outfit?
- Yes, just this morning. And yours?

35:21.272 --> 35:23.183
This old thing? I got it last week.

35:24.984 --> 35:26.417
Come on, Chad.

35:30.073 --> 35:31.347
What do you think?

35:31.491 --> 35:34.767
Well, it's 190 to the pin,
downhill lie, elevated green.

35:34.994 --> 35:37.110
I'd go with a full five, sir.

35:40.001 --> 35:41.070
Hi.

35:48.801 --> 35:50.678
- Nice call.
- All right.

35:55.808 --> 35:59.198
Princess, grab your pitching wedge.
This one's yours.

35:59.437 --> 36:00.870
Thanks, Daddy.

36:05.317 --> 36:06.636
Line it up.

36:16.121 --> 36:17.270
That's my girl.

36:17.414 --> 36:19.882
That girl needs to take up knitting.

36:20.084 --> 36:21.836
Or some sport
where she can only injure herself.

36:22.002 --> 36:24.072
- I'm in the sand.
- Me, too.

36:28.508 --> 36:32.421
Knees, hips, shoulders, hat.
Good. Drill it.

36:34.307 --> 36:35.626
Backboard.

36:36.309 --> 36:37.344
Yes!

36:37.768 --> 36:39.201
That's my boy.

36:51.950 --> 36:53.463
- Where...
- I have no idea.

36:54.953 --> 36:58.832
Gabriella! Dinner tonight?
Sneak a swim?

37:00.459 --> 37:01.574
Troy!

37:09.762 --> 37:11.434
- Oh, lovely, darling.
- Nice.

37:11.594 --> 37:13.630
Daddy, why not let Troy try a shot?

37:13.805 --> 37:15.875
- Of course. Of course.
- No, I shouldn't.

37:16.058 --> 37:17.252
- Come on.
- Are you sure?

37:17.392 --> 37:18.711
- Yeah!
- Yes, sir.

37:18.853 --> 37:21.651
- Are you sure it's okay, Mr Evans?
- It sure is.

37:21.856 --> 37:24.051
- Give it a ride.
- Thank you.

37:24.232 --> 37:25.551
- Here you go, Daddy.
- Thank you, dear.

37:32.449 --> 37:34.440
- That's a beautiful swing.
- Really beautiful.

37:34.994 --> 37:37.713
That is a beautiful swing.

37:39.458 --> 37:40.732
- That was awesome.
- Thanks, man.

37:40.875 --> 37:44.026
- Come on! What do you say we...
- What? I don't know.

37:44.421 --> 37:45.740
Off we go.

37:48.758 --> 37:52.797
I'm saving up for a car.
I'm saving up for a car.

38:09.029 --> 38:11.748
Well, Tiger Woods would
have been proud to make that putt!

38:12.698 --> 38:15.929
What a shame that Troy
is only bussing dishes all summer,

38:16.160 --> 38:18.515
given that he's a potential star
for your alma mater, Daddy.

38:18.706 --> 38:20.822
I've seen Troy play basketball.

38:20.999 --> 38:23.752
I think the U of A Redhawks
will be very interested in him.

38:23.960 --> 38:28.511
That's inspired, Daddy.
Troy is very concerned about college.

38:28.799 --> 38:29.914
- Really?
- Yeah.

38:30.050 --> 38:32.245
- How's Coach Bolton these days?
- Oh, fantastic.

38:32.428 --> 38:33.861
Outstanding.

38:37.391 --> 38:38.380
What?

38:38.892 --> 38:41.531
Oh, next time
I see Country Club Princess,

38:41.730 --> 38:44.039
I'm gonna launch her and her pink cart
straight into the lake.

38:44.231 --> 38:45.425
I'll build the ramp, buddy.

38:45.567 --> 38:48.559
Danforth, this is a kitchen,
not a day spa.

38:48.779 --> 38:51.418
You and Jason suit up for dinner duty
in the dining room.

38:51.614 --> 38:54.890
Bolton, you have five minutes
to change and come with me.

38:55.118 --> 38:57.712
In case you're not familiar
with this particular item,

38:57.912 --> 38:59.823
it goes around your neck,

39:00.208 --> 39:03.041
like a dog collar.

39:03.919 --> 39:05.272
Chop-chop.

39:09.132 --> 39:12.249
- And she stepped on the ball.
- I did not.

39:12.470 --> 39:14.984
- Yes, you did.
- I can believe that.

39:15.181 --> 39:19.299
Hey! Here's our superstar.
Troy Bolton, this is Peter.

39:19.561 --> 39:20.880
- Peter. Good to meet you.
- How are you?

39:21.020 --> 39:22.055
- This is Claire.
- Hello.

39:22.189 --> 39:24.100
- And you know the family.
- Hello.

39:24.273 --> 39:27.709
This kid's pretty handy on the fairways
as well as the hard court.

39:27.943 --> 39:29.342
Bet you worked up yourself an appetite

39:29.486 --> 39:31.124
lugging those bags
all over the place, huh?

39:31.281 --> 39:32.316
Yeah, yeah. A little bit.

39:32.449 --> 39:35.009
What do you say we get some food,
and we can talk about your future.

39:35.202 --> 39:36.999
- My future?
- Yeah, sit down.

39:37.162 --> 39:38.641
Have a seat.

39:38.787 --> 39:41.620
Daddy's on the board of directors
at the University of Albuquerque.

39:41.834 --> 39:46.066
So, Troy, I saw your
championship game. I mean, wow!

39:46.338 --> 39:49.136
That last-second shot at the buzzer...
Outstanding.

39:49.341 --> 39:51.571
Actually, my teammates here
stole the ball,

39:51.759 --> 39:52.987
otherwise I wouldn't have
had a chance...

39:53.135 --> 39:55.285
Oh, you're much too modest, Troy.

39:55.472 --> 39:58.111
You were voted MVP
for the entire season.

40:00.812 --> 40:03.929
This shirt positively screams
for a Windsor knot.

40:04.982 --> 40:06.381
- Thank you.
- Let me get that for you.

40:11.737 --> 40:14.376
You know, we've got a heck of
a basketball programme over at U of A,

40:14.618 --> 40:16.529
and an excellent
scholarship programme as well.

40:16.703 --> 40:18.022
Scholarship?

40:18.871 --> 40:20.907
Yeah. You know,
between the two of us here,

40:21.080 --> 40:24.152
we... We pull a little weight over
at the school.

40:26.087 --> 40:29.796
Well, time flies when you're having fun,

40:30.050 --> 40:32.928
but Mr Fulton will probably
want me clocking out.

40:33.387 --> 40:34.581
Come on. Don't be silly.

40:34.721 --> 40:37.360
You haven't had any dessert,
and we haven't talked about golf, yet.

40:37.556 --> 40:40.707
Oh, basketball and golf are
just the beginning with Troy, Daddy.

40:40.935 --> 40:42.493
Have you heard him sing?

40:42.646 --> 40:44.318
Oh, triple threat.

40:44.481 --> 40:47.598
Oh, how wonderful.
Troy can participate in the talent show.

40:47.818 --> 40:50.890
Oh, come on, Troy.
Give them a sample. Kelsi!

40:51.111 --> 40:54.387
Kelsi. No, actually my voice is...

40:54.617 --> 40:57.211
Is feeling a little bit hoarse tonight,
you know, all the talking.

40:57.410 --> 41:00.846
But thank you very much for the food
and the golf and everything.

41:01.082 --> 41:02.197
It was amazing.

41:02.332 --> 41:07.122
But you will sing some other time,
though? With me. Promise?

41:14.553 --> 41:16.305
- Promise.
- Perfect.

41:18.516 --> 41:19.710
Dessert?

41:41.289 --> 41:43.405
Sorry I'm late!
Give me two more minutes.

41:43.583 --> 41:46.734
Nice tie. Your shoes
don't match though. Kidding.

41:53.677 --> 41:57.829
Honey, two minutes is being late,
but an hour is approaching a felony.

41:58.099 --> 42:00.818
Just because Troy's a nice guy, doesn't
mean he's immune to boy disease.

42:01.017 --> 42:02.006
Boy disease?

42:02.145 --> 42:03.544
Yeah, forgetting things
he shouldn't forget.

42:03.687 --> 42:05.040
Oh, so now you're a boy expert?

42:05.188 --> 42:07.986
My older sister has 10 rules
about boy behaviour,

42:08.192 --> 42:09.864
and nine of them involve boys
forgetting things

42:10.027 --> 42:12.621
they should never forget,
like dinner dates.

42:12.823 --> 42:15.417
Well, it wasn't an official date
type of thing.

42:16.367 --> 42:19.086
Rule number three,
all dates are official,

42:19.286 --> 42:20.765
whether the boy knows it or not.

42:25.877 --> 42:27.833
- You're not done.
- But I'm done for the day, sir.

42:28.004 --> 42:28.993
And actually, I have a date.

42:29.130 --> 42:31.246
Mr Bolton, you're under
the mistaken impression

42:31.426 --> 42:34.338
I'm interested in what you have to say.
Just follow me.

42:34.552 --> 42:36.543
- But I...
- No more speaking.

42:47.731 --> 42:49.562
- Hey, where are we going?
- Please, Mr Bolton.

42:49.735 --> 42:52.010
- How long is this gonna take?
- Watch your step. Insurance issues.

42:52.196 --> 42:53.185
I'm supposed to have a date tonight.

42:53.322 --> 42:56.120
But the evening is young
and so are you.

42:56.325 --> 42:57.724
Well, where are we?

42:58.202 --> 43:00.796
Hold your applause until the very end.

One minute.

46:35.550 --> 46:38.018
We'll talk about this later.

46:38.720 --> 46:40.517
So, you love it?

46:40.679 --> 46:43.068
Look, you ever tried just singing?

46:43.266 --> 46:47.100
I mean, without all the lights and sets
and, like, backup people?

46:48.063 --> 46:50.338
Well, it'd be much harder
to get applause that way.

46:50.523 --> 46:52.195
I'm not talking about applause.

46:52.360 --> 46:54.749
I'm talking about hanging out
with friends.

46:54.947 --> 46:57.177
You know, doing nothing,
and singing for fun.

46:57.781 --> 47:01.456
Wait a minute. Not doing anything.

47:02.369 --> 47:06.760
That might work.
A dark stage, a single spotlight.

47:07.041 --> 47:10.431
We break out of darkness
into the circle of light.

47:10.670 --> 47:12.183
- Wait, "we"?
- No set, no frills.

47:12.339 --> 47:14.216
- Oh, man.
- Simple.

47:14.382 --> 47:16.816
Dramatic. Just you and me.

47:18.010 --> 47:21.002
That is such a great idea, Troy.
We could do it at our club talent show.

47:21.222 --> 47:22.655
Look, I'm here to work.

47:22.808 --> 47:25.686
Sharpay, I already told you
being onstage really is your thing,

47:25.894 --> 47:27.373
it's not mine.

47:27.937 --> 47:30.610
It could be our thing.

47:31.942 --> 47:34.297
Time out on that one, okay?
I've got an "our thing,"

47:34.486 --> 47:37.000
it's with Gabriella, and...
And I'm very late for her, so I got to go.

47:37.198 --> 47:40.315
- But the show could be so amazing...
- I love your shoes.

47:41.076 --> 47:42.191
- You like them?
- I really do.

47:42.327 --> 47:45.603
I bought them in New York.
I have them in nine colours.

47:48.919 --> 47:51.069
Girls! Again from the top.

48:15.276 --> 48:18.109
Hey, lifeguard!

48:20.993 --> 48:22.824
You're crazy, Wildcat!

48:23.620 --> 48:27.169
And so late, but I brought food,
a few little candles.

48:27.416 --> 48:29.407
I'm good for a poolside picnic.
What do you say?

48:29.585 --> 48:33.817
Zeke even made desserts.
But first, I dare you to jump in.

48:34.089 --> 48:37.638
You know we're not supposed
to be in the pool. Club rules.

48:40.847 --> 48:42.246
Cramp!

48:43.516 --> 48:48.749
I need a lifeguard!
Rescue me! Rescue me!

48:50.398 --> 48:51.831
Here I come!

49:06.081 --> 49:08.549
Thanks for coming in. Follow me.

49:36.153 --> 49:38.030
Oh, listen.

49:41.785 --> 49:44.982
You know, right now, with you,

49:47.414 --> 49:50.247
it's finally starting to feel like summer.

49:50.918 --> 49:52.351
Yeah, it is.

49:56.132 --> 49:57.565
The water bugs are back.

49:57.717 --> 50:00.754
Look, Mr Fulton, this was my idea,
she had nothing to do with it.

50:00.972 --> 50:04.123
I generously overlooked
your previous break violation,

50:04.349 --> 50:06.419
but then came the golf course jaunt,

50:06.601 --> 50:10.230
and now this. Two strikes.

50:11.983 --> 50:15.100
Don't get a third. Out of the pool.

50:21.284 --> 50:23.036
Sharpay's dad let me play a few holes

50:23.201 --> 50:24.953
and then invited me to dinner
with some U of A alumni.

50:25.120 --> 50:26.155
Really?

50:26.289 --> 50:27.927
And they were talking
about scholarships,

50:28.081 --> 50:30.834
while Jason and Chad
were, like, serving me.

50:31.627 --> 50:33.424
And getting paid for it. It's called a job.

50:33.587 --> 50:35.225
You were invited,
nothing wrong with that.

50:35.380 --> 50:37.530
Yeah. I don't know. It felt weird.

50:37.717 --> 50:40.185
I love that you've got the team
working together,

50:40.386 --> 50:42.024
but you're not gonna be
a Wildcat forever.

50:42.179 --> 50:45.535
The team is now, and that's... It's good,

50:45.766 --> 50:47.916
but everybody's got their own future.

50:48.102 --> 50:50.411
I'm not sure I know what you mean.

50:52.232 --> 50:54.587
Well, when you graduate,

50:54.776 --> 50:57.415
lots of people are gonna be
chasing the same opportunities.

50:57.611 --> 51:00.250
There's nothing wrong with
keeping your eye on the prize.

51:00.450 --> 51:02.441
In fact, if you don't, you get left behind.

51:02.618 --> 51:05.178
Yeah, I know, I'm just saying,
I didn't get my friends jobs at the club

51:05.370 --> 51:08.009
so they could sit and watch me
eat in the dining room.

51:08.207 --> 51:10.038
You know, I'm just saying
never be ashamed of attention,

51:10.208 --> 51:11.721
as long as you've earned it.

51:11.877 --> 51:13.310
You know, a scholarship's special,

51:13.462 --> 51:14.815
that's why there's only a few
to go around.

51:14.964 --> 51:16.920
Yeah, yeah. I get it, Dad.

51:20.384 --> 51:23.421
Okay. So, how was the food
at Lava Springs?

51:24.181 --> 51:25.614
Insanely good.

51:27.643 --> 51:29.520
- Take it out for a spin.
- No way.

51:29.687 --> 51:32.997
Well, you didn't think I was going
to drive this heap, did you?

51:33.731 --> 51:35.926
Yes! Yes!

51:36.402 --> 51:39.314
Okay, bring those knees up as high
as you can and circle those arms.

51:39.530 --> 51:42.761
Hey, water bug. Last night was so fun.

51:42.992 --> 51:44.186
I really didn't mean
to get you in trouble.

51:44.327 --> 51:45.806
Same here.

51:45.954 --> 51:48.787
- So, maybe today we can have our...
- Troy?

51:51.584 --> 51:53.336
What time is your lunch break?

51:53.502 --> 51:54.491
Troy!

51:56.797 --> 51:58.196
- 1:30.
- 1:30, great.

51:58.341 --> 52:01.890
Free cheeseburgers are on me.
Everybody looks great. Awesome job.

52:02.136 --> 52:04.206
Okay, now, some jumping jacks.

52:05.432 --> 52:07.263
Hey. What is she up to?

52:08.602 --> 52:11.321
- Who knows?
- Believe me, she does.

52:15.943 --> 52:17.092
I'm sorry I'm late, Mr Fulton,

52:17.235 --> 52:19.988
but about the pool thing last night,
you can't blame Gabriella...

52:20.197 --> 52:22.028
- I'm promoting you.
- You're what?

52:22.198 --> 52:24.587
There's an opening
as an assistant to the golf pros.

52:24.785 --> 52:26.901
Salaried job, no clocking in.

52:27.079 --> 52:30.389
- But, I...
- $500 a week, plus tips.

52:31.209 --> 52:33.165
What? Per week?

52:33.961 --> 52:38.477
Oh, my... That's off the hook!
I think it sounds very manageable.

52:39.717 --> 52:41.116
Shall we?

52:45.307 --> 52:46.501
Bolton!

52:48.642 --> 52:53.033
- Wait. So you want me to teach golf?
- To kids. Oh, the joy.

52:53.565 --> 52:56.921
- But, sir, I don't think I'm qualified.
- Worry not.

52:57.401 --> 53:00.154
Simply show the little angels
which end of the club to hold,

53:00.363 --> 53:02.479
tee the ball up, then duck.

53:02.824 --> 53:07.136
In addition, the board is extending
membership privileges to you.

53:07.412 --> 53:10.961
You have complete use
of club facilities, but do so prudently,

53:11.208 --> 53:14.405
meaning, fellow Wildcats? Not.

53:17.299 --> 53:18.812
Congratulations.

53:19.674 --> 53:22.427
You'll find an appropriate choice
of clothing here.

53:22.636 --> 53:24.911
Do not mix checks with plaids,
blue with browns,

53:25.097 --> 53:27.975
and avoid wearing white socks
at all cost.

53:28.183 --> 53:29.536
Leave your shoes outside the locker,

53:29.683 --> 53:32.595
they will be buffed and polished
each evening.

53:33.690 --> 53:36.284
Yes! Oh, man!

53:37.361 --> 53:38.760
Save it for the first tee.

53:38.904 --> 53:43.341
And to get there,
this might come in handy.

53:43.616 --> 53:48.132
That's the key to your golf cart.
Number 14.

53:48.413 --> 53:52.725
The same number that's on your
basketball uniform, so I'm told.

53:53.001 --> 53:54.320
Questions?

53:54.461 --> 53:56.179
How did this happen?

53:56.963 --> 54:01.479
It would seem that the Evans family
thinks you have untapped potential.

54:01.759 --> 54:06.787
Young man,
the future is full of uncharted waters,

54:07.098 --> 54:11.569
and this family has real clout,
so I suggest you take the ride.

54:16.106 --> 54:17.221
Yeah.

54:21.114 --> 54:22.103
Italian.

54:22.281 --> 54:25.079
Awesome, junior golfers!
You guys look amazing!

54:26.869 --> 54:29.337
Hey! Hey! Slow down, champ.
Slow down.

54:29.788 --> 54:32.302
Save some for the other kids.
There you go.

54:32.499 --> 54:34.490
Cool shorts, buddy.

54:34.669 --> 54:38.628
All right. Hey. Hey, cutie.
Try holding the club that way,

54:38.881 --> 54:41.031
you're going to hit it way farther.

54:41.218 --> 54:45.097
All right. Nice backswing, man.
Nice backswing.

54:45.347 --> 54:47.907
Good job, killer. Make the ball fear you.

54:48.100 --> 54:50.411
You look good. Great job, everybody.
Good job, guys!

54:50.511 --> 54:53.469
- Bolton. Bolton. Your 11:30 is here.
- Thanks, man.

54:53.680 --> 54:55.193
Good luck, buddy.

54:58.727 --> 54:59.876
Troy!

55:00.436 --> 55:01.915
Oh, man.

55:04.942 --> 55:06.500
- Cool balls.
- Thanks.

55:06.652 --> 55:07.721
You're welcome.

55:07.863 --> 55:09.933
By the end of summer,
you'll have me playing like a pro.

55:10.115 --> 55:11.184
Yeah.

55:12.783 --> 55:14.978
If I live that long.

55:18.497 --> 55:20.249
I'm so excited about the show.

55:20.415 --> 55:23.487
Oh, and don't worry.
We'll find something great to do.

55:23.711 --> 55:28.466
Look, Sharpay, I already told you,
singing really isn't my thing.

55:28.758 --> 55:31.431
And here's the best news,
all the Redhawk boosters will be there.

55:31.635 --> 55:33.546
- Really?
- Of course.

55:33.722 --> 55:37.954
We'll lock up your scholarship
with a high "C" right from centre stage.

55:39.894 --> 55:41.088
We're all in this together, right?

55:41.229 --> 55:43.743
Your parents have been really,
really nice, Sharpay,

55:43.940 --> 55:46.170
but singing with you
isn't a part of my job.

55:46.360 --> 55:49.989
I know,
just something you promised to do.

55:50.238 --> 55:51.512
Remember?

55:53.993 --> 55:56.348
You look fabulous in your new clothes,
by the way.

55:56.537 --> 56:00.496
- You like the shoes? They're Italian.
- Nice.

56:03.835 --> 56:05.985
Let me show you how this is done.
It's really easy.

56:06.171 --> 56:10.244
Just line up to your target.
Nice, easy backswing.

56:11.176 --> 56:12.734
- Hey, Gab.
- Hey!

56:18.351 --> 56:22.264
That girl's got more moves than
an octopus in a wrestling match.

56:22.522 --> 56:25.673
- Nah. He knows how to swim.
- Yeah. Troy can handle himself.

56:25.899 --> 56:27.935
I did overhear him asking her
for her opinion

56:28.110 --> 56:31.625
on his new Italian golf shoes.

56:31.863 --> 56:33.057
He didn't ask me.

56:33.200 --> 56:36.556
So, wake up, sister! She's basically
offering him a college education

56:36.787 --> 56:38.857
just to sing with her in the talent show.

56:39.038 --> 56:43.111
- Troy would never do that.
- You got eyes, use them.

56:43.375 --> 56:46.890
- Let's go eat.
- Yeah, I got to go. Hey, see you later?

56:47.131 --> 56:48.564
- Okay.
- Okay.

56:48.715 --> 56:50.706
You're going to take it back
and through.

56:50.926 --> 56:55.044
- Troy, Fulton wants you in the lobby.
- Fantastic. Thank you. See you.

57:06.109 --> 57:08.669
And she steps on the ball.

57:10.237 --> 57:13.195
- Troy Bolton. This is...
- I've seen them all play at U of A.

57:13.407 --> 57:15.477
Oh, all right.
Well, come scrimmage at our gym.

57:15.660 --> 57:17.616
It'll be good for your game.

57:17.787 --> 57:20.665
- Play with you guys?
- Yeah. Let's get down, bro.

57:21.915 --> 57:23.507
- Awesome.
- All right.

57:23.667 --> 57:26.227
- Let's all get some awesome lunch.
- Yeah.

57:26.421 --> 57:28.377
I knew it! Coral blue!

57:28.547 --> 57:31.300
It's perfect for your skin tone.
And mine, too!

57:31.509 --> 57:33.500
We are majorly skin-tone compatible,
Troy.

57:33.678 --> 57:37.751
- I have no idea what that means.
- You don't need to. I'm here for you.

57:39.393 --> 57:40.621
- Who's hungry?
- Let's eat.

57:41.395 --> 57:44.034
I mean, how can you hit the ball
straight if your clubs don't trust you?

57:44.231 --> 57:46.142
- That's the key. So, it's all in the grip.
- Okay.

57:46.317 --> 57:49.275
You got to hold it just right.
That looks great.

57:49.485 --> 57:51.521
Hey, I almost forgot.

57:51.697 --> 57:53.050
I ordered Swiss on my burger.

57:53.198 --> 57:55.393
So, go ahead and check it out, man.
Try it. See what you think.

57:55.575 --> 57:58.328
Danforth, table three
needs more iced tea.

57:58.537 --> 58:00.175
Now, rotate your hands over the top.

58:00.330 --> 58:01.649
- Put your thumb on that side.
- Okay.

58:01.790 --> 58:04.145
There you go, man. You're good.
I'll see you on the course.

58:04.335 --> 58:05.848
- Yeah. Let's do it, man.
- Yeah.

58:06.630 --> 58:09.827
- Zeke! Troy wants Swiss.
- Coming right up.

58:10.048 --> 58:11.117
You know, you were right.

58:11.257 --> 58:12.929
There's a guy out there
that looks just like Troy Bolton,

58:13.094 --> 58:15.528
but I have no idea who he really is.

58:25.315 --> 58:27.351
Oh, hey.
Kelsi's got some great new ideas

58:27.527 --> 58:29.165
- to spice up the talent show. It's got...
- I'm thrilled.

58:29.318 --> 58:32.628
That new duet
that Troy and Gabriella sang? I need it.

58:32.864 --> 58:35.219
- Actually, it's not available.
- Repeat.

58:35.409 --> 58:37.639
Well, it's something I wrote
for Troy and Gabriella,

58:37.826 --> 58:38.815
just in case they decide to...

58:38.953 --> 58:43.708
You're an employee,
not a fairy godmother. Let's have it.

58:45.628 --> 58:49.587
Transpose it into my key. Troy and I
will be doing it in the talent show.

58:49.840 --> 58:52.718
Oh, and brighten up the tempo.
We'll need to keep people awake.

58:52.925 --> 58:53.960
What about our song?

58:54.094 --> 58:56.892
- What about Humu Humu?
- Change in plans.

58:57.098 --> 58:59.737
What am I supposed to do
with my Tiki Warrior outfit?

58:59.932 --> 59:03.208
Save it for Halloween, go to a luau,
sell it online. I don't know!

59:03.438 --> 59:06.510
But in the meantime,
keep an eye on those Wildcats.

59:06.732 --> 59:08.370
If they're planning on
being in the show,

59:08.525 --> 59:10.880
which I doubt,
once they hear about Troy and me,

59:11.111 --> 59:14.342
I don't want any surprises.
Oh, and don't worry,

59:14.574 --> 59:17.691
I'll find a song for you
somewhere in the show.

59:17.912 --> 59:20.028
- Or the next show.
- Really?

59:22.040 --> 59:23.871
Don't strain yourself, slick.

59:27.170 --> 59:31.322
Entertainers are so temperamental.
Transpose!

59:42.561 --> 59:44.916
Look at you.

59:45.106 --> 59:47.859
- Go, team.
- Yeah. It's a gift from the guys.

59:49.943 --> 59:53.822
The "guys"?
Oh, you mean all those tall people?

59:54.073 --> 59:58.032
Yeah. Yeah.
Hey, look. I got to go in a minute,

59:58.287 --> 01:00:00.801
but I'll be back in about an hour.
I'll pick you up in my new truck

01:00:00.997 --> 01:00:03.306
and we'll go to a movie. I promise.

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:07.139
"Promise" is a really big word, Troy.

01:00:08.629 --> 01:00:10.062
Yeah. I know.

01:00:10.214 --> 01:00:12.728
And we've got
the staff baseball game after work.

01:00:12.925 --> 01:00:14.597
Remember, you "promised"
that you'd play?

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:17.877
Right. Right. Baseball.
I will absolutely meet you there.

01:00:18.098 --> 01:00:21.249
- You forgot, didn't you?
- No. I just got the date mixed up.

01:00:21.476 --> 01:00:24.309
And I'm sorry
I couldn't make lunch today. I just...

01:00:24.521 --> 01:00:26.830
It's been wild, you know?

01:00:27.023 --> 01:00:29.139
I can't believe
how things are working out here.

01:00:29.318 --> 01:00:34.551
So I see. Italian golf shoes,
new clothes, golf carts.

01:00:34.864 --> 01:00:38.743
That's crazy stuff.
Hard to keep track of it all, I bet.

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:40.229
So, what's your point?

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:45.490
It just doesn't seem like new stuff,
it seems like a new Troy.

01:00:45.793 --> 01:00:49.103
All right, let's see if Tiger Woods
still has a jump shot.

01:00:49.338 --> 01:00:52.091
- Hey, hey, Bolton! Come on!
- Hey!

01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:53.813
Why don't you tell them
to come over here and mix it up?

01:00:53.967 --> 01:00:55.036
We'll show them some game.

01:00:55.177 --> 01:00:57.213
You know,
I don't think that's how they roll.

01:00:57.388 --> 01:00:58.537
That's not how they "roll"?

01:00:58.681 --> 01:01:02.435
No, no, no, that's not what I meant.
I just think it's a closed practice. Sorry.

01:01:02.684 --> 01:01:04.640
Wow. Well,
maybe you can get us a video?

01:01:04.812 --> 01:01:06.006
Bolton, come on!

01:01:06.146 --> 01:01:08.341
But yesterday you said we were
going to play two-on-two after work,

01:01:08.524 --> 01:01:12.119
- before the baseball game.
- I know. I know, man. I'm sorry.

01:01:13.154 --> 01:01:17.545
Come on, Zeke, that was so yesterday.
You know, when we were all on a team!

01:01:18.033 --> 01:01:19.671
- Hey, man.
- Hey, how's it going?

01:01:19.912 --> 01:01:22.472
Hey, Bolton! That's my ball.

01:01:28.837 --> 01:01:30.555
- Here we go!
- How's it going, guys?

01:01:30.715 --> 01:01:32.307
Would you guys be mad at me
if I ask him to get me

01:01:32.465 --> 01:01:34.820
one of those cool Redhawk jackets?

01:01:37.847 --> 01:01:39.280
Hey. Come on.

01:01:45.396 --> 01:01:48.069
I'm so excited about the game.
It's going to be so cool.

01:01:48.273 --> 01:01:51.185
Hey, Ryan. No rehearsals?

01:01:51.401 --> 01:01:54.234
My sister is working up something new.

01:01:54.447 --> 01:01:56.915
So, you coming to the baseball game?

01:01:57.117 --> 01:01:59.631
I'm not staff. Wasn't invited.

01:01:59.827 --> 01:02:02.819
Hey, everyone's invited.
Come on. Hop in.

01:02:04.539 --> 01:02:05.938
All right.

01:02:07.334 --> 01:02:08.562
Hold on!

01:02:11.548 --> 01:02:13.459
All right! Right here!

01:02:19.389 --> 01:02:20.708
Beep, beep!

01:02:23.892 --> 01:02:24.961
Beep, beep!

01:02:26.604 --> 01:02:28.640
What, did Fulton send you out here
to spy on us?

01:02:28.816 --> 01:02:29.965
Nah, my sister did.

01:02:30.108 --> 01:02:31.939
She thinks you guys are going to
upstage her talent show.

01:02:32.109 --> 01:02:34.145
Oh, no worries.
We were going to do the show,

01:02:34.321 --> 01:02:36.630
but then Troy bailed on us,
so, whatever.

01:02:36.823 --> 01:02:39.735
What do you mean "whatever"?
It's our summer, remember?

01:02:39.951 --> 01:02:41.987
I thought we decided
doing the show would be fun.

01:02:42.162 --> 01:02:43.561
- Well, I think so.
- Me, too.

01:02:43.706 --> 01:02:45.503
- Who are we kidding?
- I don't think so.

01:02:45.667 --> 01:02:47.066
We don't know
how to put together a show.

01:02:47.210 --> 01:02:49.599
No, but he does.

01:02:49.795 --> 01:02:53.788
If we have a real director
putting it together, it could be great.

01:02:54.801 --> 01:02:57.634
Have the employees ever won
a Star Dazzle Award?

01:02:58.012 --> 01:03:00.128
- Hey, now...
- I know what you can do, Ryan,

01:03:00.304 --> 01:03:02.181
- so why not do it for us?
- All right, look,

01:03:02.349 --> 01:03:07.218
if you want to play ball,
then grab a mitt, but I don't dance.

01:03:07.522 --> 01:03:10.639
You don't think dancing
takes some game?

01:03:13.944 --> 01:03:16.936
- You got game?
- A little.

01:03:27.626 --> 01:03:29.264
Yes!

01:03:34.508 --> 01:03:36.339
Hey, pitcher. Ball.

01:03:38.721 --> 01:03:40.632
All right! Let's hustle!
Come on! Wildcats!

01:03:40.807 --> 01:03:43.275

01:07:43.805 --> 01:07:45.079
It's okay!

01:07:46.558 --> 01:07:48.116
Hey, Evans.

01:07:49.646 --> 01:07:52.319
I'm not saying
I'm going to dance in the show,

01:07:52.523 --> 01:07:56.038
but if I did,
what would you have me do?

01:08:05.828 --> 01:08:07.466
Hey! Get back, get back!

01:08:07.621 --> 01:08:09.976
Here we go, here we go!
Defence, hold him tight!

01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:22.328
Oh, dang!

01:08:22.761 --> 01:08:25.071
This kid's good. I like what I'm seeing.

01:08:25.265 --> 01:08:28.462
Troy gives 110, 24/7,
that you can count on.

01:08:28.895 --> 01:08:29.965
Here we go!

01:08:30.812 --> 01:08:32.768
-Game. Game.
-Good game!

01:08:38.987 --> 01:08:40.180
Was I right?

01:08:40.323 --> 01:08:41.392
Great.

01:08:48.207 --> 01:08:51.085
All right,
so you call that a "little" game?

01:08:51.291 --> 01:08:56.411
Little League. World Series.
Newport, Rhode Island.

01:08:58.131 --> 01:08:59.201
Champions.

01:09:00.301 --> 01:09:02.531
- Good job!
- Nice hat.

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:05.029
- You're so awesome.
- Hey.

01:09:05.223 --> 01:09:06.258
What can I say?

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:09.662
- Troy, you ready to run it back?
- Let's run it, man.

01:09:09.810 --> 01:09:11.085
- All right. Let's go, yo.
- Let's go.

01:09:11.229 --> 01:09:13.743
Let's go, yo, let's go. Let's run it back.

01:09:20.947 --> 01:09:24.417
- Looking good.
- Wow, Wildcat!

01:09:24.868 --> 01:09:28.747
- Too much?
- Only in daylight.

01:09:28.997 --> 01:09:32.033
- Yeah.
- East High colours, very impressive.

01:09:32.252 --> 01:09:35.483
- Hey. Be true to your school, right?
- Absolutely.

01:09:35.712 --> 01:09:37.589
Everyone's excited
about doing the show.

01:09:37.756 --> 01:09:40.395
Hey, I know everyone thinks
that I'm Sharpay's poodle,

01:09:40.593 --> 01:09:42.504
- but I really think that I could...
- Hey.

01:09:42.678 --> 01:09:46.432
If they were thinking that,
they're not thinking that today.

01:09:47.142 --> 01:09:48.939
How do you do that swing-step
you did last night?

01:09:49.102 --> 01:09:50.455
That's easy.

01:09:52.814 --> 01:09:53.849
Hey.

01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:56.771
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:09:58.153 --> 01:10:02.066
So, I called last night.
I got hung up at the gym.

01:10:04.408 --> 01:10:07.081
Hey, my dad says you're doing great
with those college guys.

01:10:07.287 --> 01:10:09.164
Oh. Yeah. They're awesome.

01:10:09.330 --> 01:10:11.048
Playing with them is like being
in another world.

01:10:11.208 --> 01:10:14.245
Well, you missed out on a fun night.
It was a great game.

01:10:17.005 --> 01:10:19.439
But the dessert afterwards
had to be the best part.

01:10:19.632 --> 01:10:21.668
Her mom makes the best brownies

01:10:21.843 --> 01:10:24.994
- in the entire world.
- Yeah, I know. I've had them.

01:10:28.433 --> 01:10:30.628
Well, I'll see you guys later.

01:10:46.286 --> 01:10:48.322
Hey, LeBron,
how'd it go with the Redhawks?

01:10:48.497 --> 01:10:50.089
You know, they're very tall.

01:10:50.248 --> 01:10:52.159
We got Vince from maintenance
to play, so it worked out.

01:10:52.334 --> 01:10:54.894
- In case you were wondering.
- Maybe we could play later today.

01:10:55.088 --> 01:10:56.567
I don't know. Check with Vince.

01:10:56.713 --> 01:10:58.908
Well, Mr Evans set up the workout,
not me.

01:10:59.091 --> 01:11:01.559
Did you even ask to include us,
Captain?

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:05.548
I didn't go looking for the Redhawks,
the Redhawks came to me. Okay?

01:11:05.805 --> 01:11:09.639
I didn't sign up for this golf job,
Fulton offered it. I said yes.

01:11:09.893 --> 01:11:13.488
My decision. But I show up to work
same as you, so chill, man.

01:11:13.732 --> 01:11:15.051
You get a speck of dirt on your pants,

01:11:15.191 --> 01:11:17.386
- and someone dry cleans you.
- And you wouldn't do the same thing...

01:11:17.567 --> 01:11:18.716
- If I was as good as you?
- I did not say that.

01:11:18.861 --> 01:11:20.419
- You didn't have to!
- And neither did you!

01:11:20.572 --> 01:11:23.291
You know what? We didn't vote you
captain because of your jump shot.

01:11:23.490 --> 01:11:26.482
Okay, we did it because you're the guy
who usually knows what's up.

01:11:26.703 --> 01:11:29.137
- But I guess things change.
- You think you got me all figured out?

01:11:29.330 --> 01:11:31.366
Well, I don't think so.
And I don't answer to you.

01:11:31.541 --> 01:11:34.613
Then maybe you should
start answering to yourself!

01:11:34.835 --> 01:11:38.191
Look, we have been like brothers
since pre-school.

01:11:38.422 --> 01:11:41.141
If I don't know who you are these days,
then who does?

01:11:41.343 --> 01:11:46.781
Excuse me. You're all being paid
to work, not play Dr Phil. Chop-chop.

01:11:52.313 --> 01:11:53.826
Table settings, nice. Oh. No, no.

01:11:55.441 --> 01:11:59.992
No. No. No. Now, that? Fabulous.

01:12:00.278 --> 01:12:01.347
Troy!

01:12:03.489 --> 01:12:06.208
Daddy will make certain the entire
scholarship committee is right here.

01:12:06.410 --> 01:12:07.729
Perfect view.

01:12:07.869 --> 01:12:09.427
I've already spoken to your mother.

01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:11.969
They're going to be sitting at a table
right next to ours.

01:12:12.167 --> 01:12:13.759
It's going to be a fabulous evening.

01:12:13.917 --> 01:12:15.669
- Come on.
- Great.

01:12:16.627 --> 01:12:17.821
Rehearsal, everyone!

01:12:17.964 --> 01:12:19.397
- Taylor, I'm signing off on everything.
- Fabulous!

01:12:19.715 --> 01:12:20.909
- Thank you, Mrs Evans.
- Good job.

01:12:21.050 --> 01:12:24.645
Look, Sharpay. I know I promised
I'd do this, but just take it easy on me.

01:12:24.887 --> 01:12:28.323
I'm kind of new
to the whole performing thing.

01:12:28.559 --> 01:12:30.390

01:14:58.587 --> 01:15:00.145
Everybody break!

01:15:02.465 --> 01:15:06.856
You know, Troy,
I've always known you were special.

01:15:07.139 --> 01:15:10.256
And it's pretty obvious I'm special, too.

01:15:10.474 --> 01:15:13.546
I think we were meant to sing together,
don't you?

01:15:18.857 --> 01:15:20.415
I need some air.

01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:25.578
Don't be long!
We're going to run it again!

01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:49.988
Show me what you got!

01:15:51.766 --> 01:15:53.882
Come on, everybody! Here we go!

01:16:04.530 --> 01:16:07.169
You're up! You're up! You're up first!

01:16:07.907 --> 01:16:10.467
Here we go! Give it to me!

01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:12.616
Come on! Oh, yeah!

01:16:13.915 --> 01:16:16.793
You got it! Here we go!
Pass it to me!

01:16:17.251 --> 01:16:19.640
Come on, let's dance!

01:16:21.048 --> 01:16:22.527
You're up! You're up!

01:16:26.345 --> 01:16:27.937
Let's show them what we got!

01:16:31.223 --> 01:16:32.895
Come on! All right!

01:16:37.062 --> 01:16:39.974
Oh, cut that! Get out of here!

01:16:44.779 --> 01:16:47.577
- You got it! Hey.
- Good job!

01:16:49.870 --> 01:16:51.383
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:16:57.251 --> 01:17:00.766
I said keep an eye on them,
not turn them into the cast of Grease!

01:17:01.004 --> 01:17:02.562
Pretty cool, huh?

01:17:03.967 --> 01:17:08.438
Do you want us to lose the Star Dazzle
Award to a bunch of dishwashers?

01:17:09.972 --> 01:17:13.089
Us? Well, I guess that's showbiz.

01:17:15.227 --> 01:17:18.981
When did you become one of them?

01:17:20.942 --> 01:17:23.172
You know,
I'll take that as a compliment.

01:17:23.486 --> 01:17:26.922
But you and Troy
have a good show, sis.

01:17:27.197 --> 01:17:29.347
Oh, we plan to.

01:17:40.713 --> 01:17:42.226
Give me a beat.

01:17:51.515 --> 01:17:53.506
The Midsummer's Night Talent Show
means something to me,

01:17:53.685 --> 01:17:54.754
- and to my family.
- Well...

01:17:54.894 --> 01:17:57.044
Those Wildcats will turn it into a farce.

01:17:57.229 --> 01:18:01.268
I'm... Your brother is one of
"those Wildcats," I'm told.

01:18:01.526 --> 01:18:04.245
Oh, don't you mention that traitor to us.

01:18:04.444 --> 01:18:06.878
Employee involvement in the show
is a tradition here.

01:18:07.073 --> 01:18:10.782
Traditions change. My parents have
important guests coming.

01:18:11.035 --> 01:18:14.186
We'll need every employee working
the party, and not on stage.

01:18:14.414 --> 01:18:17.406
Pardon moi, but
we're not just talking about employees,

01:18:17.625 --> 01:18:22.983
we're talking about your classmates.
You might want to think this one out.

01:18:23.297 --> 01:18:25.015
All right.

01:18:26.135 --> 01:18:28.444
Done. Now do it.

01:18:35.018 --> 01:18:37.248
- Hi, Taylor.
- Hi.

01:18:41.441 --> 01:18:45.753
Distribute these in the staff area,
but not until the end of shift.

01:18:46.029 --> 01:18:50.227
- What? Wait! Mr Fulton...
- No discussion, Miss McKessie.

01:18:50.492 --> 01:18:54.690
This is a business.
Welcome to the world of adults

01:18:54.955 --> 01:18:58.834
who wish to keep their jobs because
they have mortgages they wish to pay,

01:18:59.085 --> 01:19:02.202
tuition bills, car payments,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

01:19:02.422 --> 01:19:05.175
So, sometimes, we have
to perform tasks, however unpleasant,

01:19:05.382 --> 01:19:07.896
that are necessary
for that all-too-important paycheque

01:19:08.093 --> 01:19:10.607
to land in our all-too-empty pockets!

01:19:13.434 --> 01:19:18.064
- May I get you a cup of tea, Mr Fulton?
- Chamomile would be lovely.

01:19:23.359 --> 01:19:28.387
- Go, Martha! Go, Martha!
- Go, Martha! Go, Martha!

01:19:28.698 --> 01:19:29.926
May I have your attention, please?

01:19:30.074 --> 01:19:32.542
You guys,
I need to make an announcement.

01:19:32.744 --> 01:19:36.214
All junior staffers will be required
to work on show night.

01:19:36.455 --> 01:19:37.774
- What?
- Yeah, it says,

01:19:37.916 --> 01:19:41.431
"No staff participation in the show
will be allowed. No exceptions. "

01:19:41.672 --> 01:19:44.186
- No show?
- There's a show. We're just not in it.

01:19:44.383 --> 01:19:45.532
That's great.

01:19:45.675 --> 01:19:48.587
I'm sorry, you guys. There's nothing
we can do about it. It's Fulton's orders.

01:19:48.803 --> 01:19:50.873
There's no way this is Fulton's idea.

01:19:51.055 --> 01:19:55.287
Unless Fulton suddenly has blonde
hair and wears designer flip-flops.

01:19:55.559 --> 01:19:56.878
Excuse me.

01:20:07.363 --> 01:20:09.672
- Totally!
- Sharpay!

01:20:15.621 --> 01:20:17.532
Forget about the rest of us,
how about the fact

01:20:17.706 --> 01:20:20.061
that your brother has worked
extremely hard on this show?

01:20:20.251 --> 01:20:24.927
Oh, boo-hoo. He'll be in the show.
He'll do his celebrity impersonations.

01:20:25.215 --> 01:20:27.683
And don't lecture me about Ryan,

01:20:27.885 --> 01:20:29.841
given the way you've been interfering
with Troy's future.

01:20:30.012 --> 01:20:31.047
What?

01:20:31.429 --> 01:20:34.341
You've gotten him written up by Fulton
for sneaking on the golf course,

01:20:34.558 --> 01:20:39.109
swimming after hours.
I had to step in just to save Troy's job.

01:20:39.397 --> 01:20:41.911
I'm not interested in what you think
you're doing for Troy.

01:20:42.108 --> 01:20:45.225
That's between you and him.
But you're messing with my friends,

01:20:45.443 --> 01:20:48.435
my summer,
and that's not okay with me.

01:20:48.656 --> 01:20:51.773
You don't like the fact that I won.

01:20:51.992 --> 01:20:55.621
What's the prize? Troy?
The Star Dazzle Award?

01:20:55.872 --> 01:20:58.545
You have to go through all of this
just to get either one?

01:20:58.750 --> 01:20:59.899
No, thanks, Sharpay.

01:21:00.042 --> 01:21:02.681
You're very good at a game
that I don't want to play,

01:21:02.879 --> 01:21:04.631
so I'm done here.

01:21:05.004 --> 01:21:06.642
But you better step away
from the mirror

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:10.873
long enough to check the damage
that will always be right behind you.

01:21:16.351 --> 01:21:17.466
Girls!

01:21:21.856 --> 01:21:24.768
Hey.
What do you mean you're done here?

01:21:24.985 --> 01:21:26.657
I mean, you can't quit.

01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:32.452
Us working together sounded good,
but plans change and people change.

01:21:32.784 --> 01:21:34.979
The club talent show is a big deal
for Sharpay,

01:21:35.162 --> 01:21:38.120
and evidently for your future,
so it's cool.

01:21:38.333 --> 01:21:39.368
Just make it happen.

01:21:39.499 --> 01:21:42.775
- Wear your new Italian shoes.
- Hey, I'm still me.

01:21:43.005 --> 01:21:44.996
Blowing off your friends,
missing dates?

01:21:45.172 --> 01:21:46.924
- If that's you, it's good to know.
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:21:47.091 --> 01:21:49.605
I was only doing that because
I'm working on the scholarship thing.

01:21:49.803 --> 01:21:51.031
You know that.

01:21:51.177 --> 01:21:52.974
But if along the way
you act like someone you're not,

01:21:53.138 --> 01:21:54.651
pretty soon that's who you become.

01:21:54.806 --> 01:21:58.845
I meant what I said about movies
and summer and just being together.

01:21:59.103 --> 01:22:01.253
I'm sure you did, at the time.

01:22:03.274 --> 01:22:08.348
But I also meant what I said,
that I want to remember this summer.

01:22:08.655 --> 01:22:10.566

You're usually taking these
right off the grill.

01:25:41.916 --> 01:25:43.144
Maybe I've been eating too much
at the club.

01:25:43.292 --> 01:25:45.362
You've barely been out of this room
the last three or four days.

01:25:45.545 --> 01:25:48.855
- Let's call the guys, get a game going.
- They wouldn't come even if I called.

01:25:49.090 --> 01:25:52.207
I find that hard to believe.

01:25:52.425 --> 01:25:57.294
Dad, do I seem different
to you this summer?

01:25:57.598 --> 01:25:59.395
You dress a lot better, that's for sure.

01:25:59.559 --> 01:26:04.075
Oh, man, I'm serious.
Maybe my friends are right,

01:26:04.357 --> 01:26:06.791
maybe I'm turning into a jerk
with new shoes.

01:26:06.983 --> 01:26:09.622
New shoes, not a new kid.
Where's this coming from?

01:26:09.820 --> 01:26:12.539
I've been so focused on my future.

01:26:12.739 --> 01:26:16.209
I mean, Gabriella quit.
Chad won't talk to me.

01:26:16.450 --> 01:26:18.008
I don't see the Wildcats
running around here.

01:26:18.162 --> 01:26:19.675
Is this about going after
what you want?

01:26:19.831 --> 01:26:22.948
Yeah, Dad.
The scholarship's important. I get it.

01:26:23.166 --> 01:26:25.236
Hey, hey.

01:26:25.418 --> 01:26:28.251
Look, it's only a big deal
if it makes sense to you.

01:26:28.465 --> 01:26:30.899
I don't even know who I am any more.

01:26:34.721 --> 01:26:37.155
You know what?

01:26:37.347 --> 01:26:41.181
I've known this kid for a long, long time.

01:26:41.436 --> 01:26:46.226
And I got a lot of faith in him.
He looks a lot like you.

01:26:47.735 --> 01:26:52.763
I'm absolutely sure he's going
to figure out the right thing to do.

01:26:56.283 --> 01:26:58.513
It's so good. I cannot wait.

01:27:03.918 --> 01:27:05.033
Yeah, I'm eating so much breakfast,

01:27:05.168 --> 01:27:07.887
I won't be able to eat my dinner
at night.

01:27:08.172 --> 01:27:10.208
Oh, yeah. It's okay, Ryan's gonna help.

01:27:10.382 --> 01:27:13.055
- I don't know.
- We'll get it eventually.

This way.

01:31:09.086 --> 01:31:10.314
What do you mean
you're not doing the show?

01:31:10.462 --> 01:31:12.657
- Exactly that.
- We're singing a duet, Troy!

01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:14.512
A duet means two people.

01:31:14.675 --> 01:31:16.506
Well, mostly me in this case,
but whatever! Duet!

01:31:16.676 --> 01:31:19.270
I'm an employee.
Employees aren't allowed in the show.

01:31:19.472 --> 01:31:21.861
No, no, no, no. No, no.
You're an honorary member.

01:31:22.057 --> 01:31:23.206
Not any more.

01:31:23.352 --> 01:31:25.388
- I asked Fulton for my kitchen job back.
- What?

01:31:25.563 --> 01:31:28.839
Sharpay, I don't like the way
you've been treating my friends.

01:31:29.064 --> 01:31:30.816
And I don't like the way
I've been treating them either,

01:31:30.983 --> 01:31:32.939
so I'm doing something about it.

01:31:33.111 --> 01:31:37.582
An entire table of University boosters
are coming to see you, thanks to me.

01:31:37.865 --> 01:31:39.821
So, I'll be their waiter.
They'll be thrilled.

01:31:39.992 --> 01:31:41.983
Troy, Troy. This could change your life!

01:31:42.162 --> 01:31:44.995
I'm more interested in
about what my friends think of me,

01:31:45.207 --> 01:31:46.720
and what I think of myself.

01:31:46.874 --> 01:31:49.752
Oh, we could all hold hands
around the campfire some other time!

01:31:49.962 --> 01:31:51.190
Right now we've got a show to do.

01:31:51.337 --> 01:31:55.535
No. You've got a show to do.
I got a kitchen to clean.

01:32:00.389 --> 01:32:01.663
It's okay.

01:32:05.978 --> 01:32:07.775
Kelsi, find Ryan.

01:32:10.358 --> 01:32:12.553
Welcome this evening.
You'll be seated at table 21.

01:32:12.734 --> 01:32:16.283
Kelly, will you escort them, please?
Excellent.

01:32:16.530 --> 01:32:17.565
Ladies, you look gorgeous

01:32:17.698 --> 01:32:20.531
- this evening. Beautiful.
- And now, returning with

01:32:20.744 --> 01:32:24.896
a abridged version
of last year's tap-dancing epic,

01:32:25.165 --> 01:32:28.601
Tina and her Tippety-Tappity Toes!

01:32:39.930 --> 01:32:41.966
There you are! Thank goodness
you've come to your senses.

01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:43.892
Plug in the volcano.
Humu Humu is back on.

01:32:44.059 --> 01:32:47.529
Enjoy your pineapple on your own, sis.
I'm not doing the show.

01:32:47.771 --> 01:32:50.888
What? Oh, put some fresh batteries
in your Tiki Warrior costume

01:32:51.108 --> 01:32:53.542
- and let's get going!
- Took your advice. Sold it online.

01:32:53.735 --> 01:32:58.490
You've always wanted the spotlight.
Now you've got it. Break a leg.

01:33:04.246 --> 01:33:06.999
The curtain's up. Showtime!

01:33:19.387 --> 01:33:22.424
Kelsi told us what went down
between you and Sharpay.

01:33:22.641 --> 01:33:26.236
I'm more interested in what went down
between me and you, man.

01:33:26.476 --> 01:33:29.388
- I was a jerk.
- Yeah.

01:33:29.606 --> 01:33:31.995
But, hey, brothers fight.

01:33:32.192 --> 01:33:34.786
And they're still brothers.

01:33:37.532 --> 01:33:38.647
All right!

01:33:38.782 --> 01:33:42.900
Guys, I messed up your show
and I'm sorry.

01:33:43.161 --> 01:33:47.154
Yeah, because show business
is our entire lives, right?

01:33:47.416 --> 01:33:50.089
Hey, I hope you haven't permanently
filled my spot in the two-on-two game.

01:33:50.294 --> 01:33:53.331
And, Ryan, I know how hard
you must've worked on this show.

01:33:53.547 --> 01:33:55.697
Making these Wildcats look good
couldn't have been easy.

01:33:55.883 --> 01:33:59.034
- Hey.
- So, I apologise.

01:33:59.260 --> 01:34:01.820
Hey, the truth is,
we've all had a lot of fun.

01:34:02.014 --> 01:34:03.049
At least, I have.

01:34:03.182 --> 01:34:07.175
Hey, you gotta see
this dude play baseball.

01:34:07.436 --> 01:34:09.392
I'm looking forward to it.

01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:12.919
- All right!
- Yeah!

01:34:13.067 --> 01:34:15.945
Troy, listen, all these people out there,

01:34:16.154 --> 01:34:19.191
I don't really want
to see my sister crash and burn.

01:34:19.408 --> 01:34:23.447
At least, I think I don't.
I think you should sing with her.

01:34:27.290 --> 01:34:31.806
My life is over. I've been a good girl.

01:34:32.088 --> 01:34:35.239
I've never lied, except when necessary.

01:34:35.467 --> 01:34:37.822
I always bought my parents
expensive gifts,

01:34:38.009 --> 01:34:41.763
using their credit card, of course.
But I don't deserve this humiliation!

01:34:42.013 --> 01:34:46.211
You need to get out there.
Mrs Hoffenfeffer and her sock puppet

01:34:46.478 --> 01:34:49.550
are stinking up the premises.

01:34:49.772 --> 01:34:52.206
Well, the only thing that
would make it any lovelier would be

01:34:52.399 --> 01:34:56.870
that if I won that Star Dazzle Award!
Sharpay, I'm going to find you.

01:34:57.154 --> 01:35:01.432
That award, I tell you, it's mine!
Mine! Mine!

01:35:01.701 --> 01:35:06.411
Mirror, mirror on the wall. Who's the...
Oh, forget it.

01:35:08.915 --> 01:35:12.066
How's your show going?

01:35:12.295 --> 01:35:13.967
How's it going?

01:35:14.130 --> 01:35:15.324
My show makes the captain
of the Titanic

01:35:15.464 --> 01:35:17.773
look like he won the lottery.

01:35:17.967 --> 01:35:21.357
- I'll sing with you, Sharpay.
- What?

01:35:21.597 --> 01:35:24.714
I promised. And I keep my promises.

01:35:24.933 --> 01:35:29.165
But what was the first thing you said
to me when I started working here?

01:35:30.481 --> 01:35:34.110
- Bring me more iced tea?
- Think harder. We're...

01:35:36.987 --> 01:35:40.900
- All in this together.
- Exactly.

01:35:41.157 --> 01:35:43.955
Well, we are.

01:35:44.161 --> 01:35:46.800
So, let's get out there
and knock them dead, Troy Bolton!

01:35:46.997 --> 01:35:50.876
I do the show
if the Wildcats do the show.

01:35:55.046 --> 01:35:56.923
And I'd think fast.

01:35:57.091 --> 01:35:59.810
I just sort of wish
you were doing this for me.

01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:04.091
You're a good guy, Troy.

01:36:06.432 --> 01:36:11.142
And actually, right now, I think
I like you better than I like myself.

01:36:11.438 --> 01:36:13.156
Did I just say that?

01:36:18.279 --> 01:36:20.554
Girls! Places!

01:36:40.470 --> 01:36:44.986
- Okay. Everyone. Ryan, the show's on.
- Where's the music? Where's Troy?

01:36:45.266 --> 01:36:47.018
Talked to Sharpay, everything's cool.

01:36:47.185 --> 01:36:51.178
Hey, speaking of my sister,
she wants you to learn a new song.

01:36:51.439 --> 01:36:54.476
Everyday. I can't learn a new song!

01:36:54.691 --> 01:36:57.489
- Kelsi will help you with it.
- What?

01:36:57.694 --> 01:37:00.003
- It's showtime!
- Yeah!

01:37:00.199 --> 01:37:05.077
- What team?
- Wildcats!

01:37:16.090 --> 01:37:19.162
Once in a lifetime

01:37:19.383 --> 01:37:22.773
And now it's time for our five-time

01:37:23.013 --> 01:37:26.130
Star Dazzle Award winner,
Miss Sharpay Evans,

01:37:26.351 --> 01:37:31.425
singing this year with
our assistant golf pro, Mr Troy Bolton.

01:37:33.898 --> 01:37:35.889
Where is Troy?

01:37:36.068 --> 01:37:39.856
- Hey. Why did you switch songs?
- Switch songs? What?

01:37:40.114 --> 01:37:43.265
- Yeah, Ryan said...
- Bolton!

01:37:43.493 --> 01:37:47.532
- But I didn't learn a new song.
- Exactly.
