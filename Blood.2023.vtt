"It's always darkest

We need to clear an airway.

Dr. Forsythe: Hi, folks.
I'm Dr. Forsythe.

29:33.815 --> 29:36.381
So, first of all,
Owen is doing much better.

29:36.483 --> 29:37.978
Okay, his fever is down,

29:38.080 --> 29:39.351
and we are gonna
keep him intubated

29:39.453 --> 29:40.986
until he's more stable.

29:41.088 --> 29:43.653
He's getting blood transfusions.
Those appear to be working.

29:43.756 --> 29:45.423
We're covering
all the bases.

29:45.525 --> 29:46.991
Is it an infection, Don?

29:47.093 --> 29:49.353
We just don't know yet.
Dr. Avery was running the labs.

29:49.455 --> 29:50.891

that the rabies tests

29:52.059 --> 29:54.360
- Yeah, yeah.
- Good.

29:54.462 --> 29:55.894
So at this point,
we suspect we're dealing with

29:55.996 --> 29:57.436
some type of anemia.

29:57.538 --> 29:59.299
How can a dog bite cause that?

29:59.401 --> 30:01.666
There are rare viral
and bacterial conditions.

30:01.768 --> 30:04.506
It's possible that he could've
contracted one from your dog.

30:04.608 --> 30:05.710
Is he gonna die?

- What? No!

the DA is not pursuing any kind

is moving forward

They're basing

1:38:38.483 --> 1:38:40.852
One, you let the children
play unsupervised

water hazard,

1:38:43.054 --> 1:38:45.452

Owen's autopsy.

an unusual deficiency of

in six months.

So, Jess, if you can
put yourself together,

1:39:18.595 --> 1:39:20.423
maybe seek counselling,
