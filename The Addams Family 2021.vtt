01:15.510 --> 01:16.554
Hello!

01:17.294 --> 01:18.861
English, please.

01:18.904 --> 01:21.690
I'm surrounded by idiots.

01:21.733 --> 01:23.474
That girl is a lot.

01:35.965 --> 01:39.229
I told you, Pugsley.
It's push, not pull.

01:39.273 --> 01:40.578
Hello, everyone!

01:41.318 --> 01:42.493
I can't believe

01:42.537 --> 01:44.756
parents let their children
go out like this.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.672
They're all so clean,

01:47.716 --> 01:49.109
shiny.

01:49.152 --> 01:50.936
Oh, it's not all bad,
my dear.

01:50.980 --> 01:52.721
At least they pit the children
against each other

01:52.764 --> 01:54.157
in a competition

01:54.201 --> 01:56.594
that will inevitably scar
the losers forever.

01:56.638 --> 01:59.945
Behold!
The gift of Prometheus!

02:05.560 --> 02:06.300
Ugh.

02:07.039 --> 02:08.302
Step aside, kid.

02:08.345 --> 02:09.781
I'll show you how it's done.

02:13.176 --> 02:14.221
- What?

02:14.264 --> 02:16.136
-

02:17.267 --> 02:19.313
Ladies and gentlemen.

02:20.401 --> 02:23.012
Come on, come on.
Wednesday is next.

02:23.055 --> 02:25.667
Have you ever
found yourself discontented

02:25.710 --> 02:27.408
by those closest to you?

02:27.451 --> 02:30.019
Are you irked
by their inability

02:30.062 --> 02:33.065
to heed simple requests?

02:33.109 --> 02:37.026
Such as, "Please don't come
to my science fair."

02:37.069 --> 02:39.115
She's talking about us.

02:40.638 --> 02:42.118
Do you ever wish
you could take

02:42.162 --> 02:43.946
their undesirable qualities

02:43.989 --> 02:46.818
and eliminate them forever?

02:46.862 --> 02:48.994
It can be done.

02:49.038 --> 02:51.736
Meet my Uncle Fester.

02:51.780 --> 02:52.998
Hello!

02:53.042 --> 02:54.913
-

02:54.957 --> 02:56.480
-That's my brother.

02:56.524 --> 02:58.090
Observe.

02:59.266 --> 03:00.615
Hmm.

03:01.790 --> 03:03.574
-Mm.

03:08.492 --> 03:09.885
- Come on!

03:09.928 --> 03:11.930
Stomach-turning, isn't it?

03:11.974 --> 03:13.584
In stark contrast, however,

03:14.672 --> 03:16.413
is Socrates.

03:17.719 --> 03:19.677
Aw.

03:19.721 --> 03:21.679
Psst! Are you gonna eat that?

03:21.723 --> 03:24.595
This led me
to ponder the question,

03:24.639 --> 03:28.077
what if personality traits
could be extracted

03:28.120 --> 03:30.427
and implanted
between creatures?

03:40.002 --> 03:41.395
Bottoms up.

03:44.876 --> 03:45.877
Ooh.

03:56.932 --> 03:59.282
Yay! All right!
Thank you, thank you.

03:59.326 --> 04:00.370
What happened?

04:02.198 --> 04:04.548
Is there a single person

04:04.592 --> 04:06.246
in the history of the world

04:06.289 --> 04:08.248
who's made more
of a breakthrough?

04:08.291 --> 04:10.772
She's an enfant terrible.

04:10.815 --> 04:13.731
With the focus on terrible.

04:13.775 --> 04:18.910
Cara mia,you know
what French does to me.

04:18.954 --> 04:23.524
And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

04:23.567 --> 04:25.874
Here to present the awards
at this year's

04:25.917 --> 04:28.180
Strange Foundation
National Science Fair,

04:28.224 --> 04:29.791
is the brilliant innovator

04:29.834 --> 04:34.448
and the namesake
of our foundation,
Cyrus Strange.

04:36.319 --> 04:38.539
Hello, everyone.

04:38.582 --> 04:39.888
Oh!

04:39.931 --> 04:42.107
I'm so honored to be here.

04:42.151 --> 04:45.110
But, well,
I'm not actually there, I'm...

04:45.154 --> 04:46.851
-

04:47.722 --> 04:49.158
Well, you get it.

04:49.201 --> 04:51.160
Welcome to this year's
science fair.

04:51.203 --> 04:52.509
I'm excited
to honor this group

04:52.553 --> 04:54.555
of brilliant minds
we have before us.

04:54.598 --> 04:56.339
Let's proceed.

04:56.383 --> 04:58.559
And the winner is...

04:58.602 --> 04:59.951
-Good luck.
-

05:01.388 --> 05:03.694
Oh. You were serious.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.611
Everyone who participated.

05:07.655 --> 05:09.874
-What?
- That's right.

05:09.918 --> 05:12.964
This year,
we are embracing
a new philosophy.

05:13.008 --> 05:15.489
Just trying
makes you a winner.

05:15.532 --> 05:18.840
But how can you be a winner
if no one is a loser?

05:18.883 --> 05:21.712
Every single
one of you is special.

05:21.756 --> 05:22.931
Disagree.

05:22.974 --> 05:23.975
He's not special.

05:24.019 --> 05:26.326
Did you see his volcano?

05:26.369 --> 05:28.371
What was that? Baking soda?

05:28.415 --> 05:29.938
Is this the third grade?

05:29.981 --> 05:32.027
It does not count!

05:32.070 --> 05:33.637
Don't you get it?

05:33.681 --> 05:36.597
-Ugh.
-I get it, Wednesday.

05:36.640 --> 05:37.946
I watched your presentation.

05:37.989 --> 05:39.991
It was brilliant.

05:40.035 --> 05:41.993
Yes, I'm aware of that.

05:42.037 --> 05:43.778
I see a kindred spirit in you.

05:43.821 --> 05:46.607
Mm-hmm.
The makings of a great mind.

05:46.650 --> 05:49.087
If you'd like to share
your research with me,

05:49.131 --> 05:51.351
I could develop it further
in my lab.

05:51.394 --> 05:53.178
Imagine what would happen

05:53.222 --> 05:56.530
if we combined your data
with the proper resources?

05:56.573 --> 05:59.315
Alas, I can't share
any of that.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.795
It's a family secret.

06:00.838 --> 06:02.579
I see.

06:02.623 --> 06:05.060
And which family is yours?

06:05.103 --> 06:06.104
Fire in the hole!

06:08.063 --> 06:09.151
Oh.

06:10.587 --> 06:12.415
Pretty hot, eh, ladies?

06:13.024 --> 06:14.983
Nice job, Romeo.

06:18.682 --> 06:21.859
For more

06:24.993 --> 06:27.778
Morticia, my queen,

06:27.822 --> 06:29.650
you inflame me.

06:29.693 --> 06:33.001
I feel liquid magma
lapping at my body.

06:33.044 --> 06:34.785
You're on fire, dear.

06:34.829 --> 06:36.570
Ha! So I am!

06:39.747 --> 06:41.401
My condolences.

07:16.131 --> 07:19.439
Great thinkers need
obstacles to function.

07:19.482 --> 07:21.832
Yet, with every
meaningless trophy,

07:21.876 --> 07:25.619
I become more
and more unremarkable.

07:25.662 --> 07:30.319
And with every hug,
more brain cells erode.

07:30.362 --> 07:33.583
But, like the phoenix
from the ashes,

07:33.627 --> 07:36.281
I shall rise above
this setback.

07:37.587 --> 07:41.025
Together, we shall turn heads,
Socrates.

07:42.331 --> 07:44.768
Starting with Pugsley.

07:44.812 --> 07:45.900
-

07:48.206 --> 07:50.731
-Love hurts, huh, kid?
-Huh?

07:50.774 --> 07:53.124
Well, I saw you
swing and miss horribly

07:53.168 --> 07:55.518
with the ladies
at the science fair.

07:55.562 --> 07:59.000
So, I thought
you should read my book!

07:59.043 --> 08:03.918
The Fester Method: How to Woo
and Other Tips on Love.

08:05.267 --> 08:06.486
You wrote this?

08:06.529 --> 08:08.313
Self-published,
on the Internet.

08:08.357 --> 08:10.228
Not easy to do.

08:10.272 --> 08:13.231
Pugsley, I've been
on three first dates.

08:13.275 --> 08:16.670
I mean, who else
has that kind of experience?

08:20.064 --> 08:23.677
I know this, uh,
goes against guy code,

08:23.720 --> 08:25.548
but what are you doing
Friday night?

08:25.592 --> 08:27.550
-

08:30.510 --> 08:32.294
Hey, you kids,
come on down here.

08:32.337 --> 08:33.513
It's dinner time.

08:33.556 --> 08:35.384
Mmm.

08:35.427 --> 08:36.603
-Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!

08:37.908 --> 08:40.215
It's dinner time,
my favorite nighttime meal!

08:40.258 --> 08:41.433
My balls!

08:43.479 --> 08:45.089
-uh-oh, my head!

08:48.092 --> 08:50.138
Mmm.

08:51.182 --> 08:52.140
Oh!

08:53.445 --> 08:55.230
-

08:55.273 --> 08:57.145
Please, Uncle Fester,
wait for the children.

08:57.188 --> 08:58.625
Children?

08:58.668 --> 09:00.757
I thought
we were having chicken.

09:00.801 --> 09:02.454
Where are those two?

09:02.498 --> 09:04.848
Pugsley may have an appetite
for destruction,

09:04.892 --> 09:07.024
but it's never a match
for his stomach.

09:07.068 --> 09:08.504
I wouldn't wait on Pugsley.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.985
Kid's got
a lot of homework to do.

09:11.028 --> 09:12.552
This generation.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.554
Let's at least wait
for Wednesday.

09:16.381 --> 09:18.514
Why does nobody in this family

09:18.558 --> 09:20.168
come in
through the front door?

09:20.211 --> 09:22.257
"Dearest Mother and Father,

09:22.300 --> 09:25.216
I will not be attending
this evening's
ritual mastication."

09:25.260 --> 09:26.522
I guess she's not hungry.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.524
"It's not that I'm not hungry,

09:28.568 --> 09:30.526
I am just choosing
to spare myself

09:30.570 --> 09:33.660
the agony of your compliments
on my performance today

09:33.703 --> 09:36.750
and your needy attempt
to hang my award
above the fireplace."

09:36.793 --> 09:38.621
I should go
try to talk to her.

09:38.665 --> 09:40.362
"Don't try to talk to me.

09:40.405 --> 09:41.668
I want to be alone."

09:41.711 --> 09:44.235
We should bring her
a plate at least.

09:44.279 --> 09:46.411
"P.S. Don't even
bring me a plate."

09:46.455 --> 09:48.979
This is the third dinner

09:49.023 --> 09:50.546
Wednesday has skipped
this week.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.113
Why is she avoiding us?

09:52.156 --> 09:55.116
All I ever do is try to love
and support her.

09:55.159 --> 09:58.467
Gomez, I think she's saying
that's the problem.

09:58.510 --> 10:01.513
You're brilliant, cara mia.

10:01.557 --> 10:03.472
-What?
-She's trying to tell me

10:03.515 --> 10:05.692
that what a young girl wants

10:05.735 --> 10:07.607
is a ton of attention
from her father.

10:07.650 --> 10:10.697
Or you could just
keep being yourself.

10:10.740 --> 10:13.395
Let her come back to us
when she's ready.

10:13.438 --> 10:15.353
But that could take forever!

10:15.397 --> 10:19.401
I have the very solution
to the problem, cara mia.

10:19.444 --> 10:20.968
We'll take a family road trip.

10:21.011 --> 10:22.534
What?

10:22.578 --> 10:25.102
You've always wanted to see
more of this great country.

10:25.146 --> 10:26.800
Well, it's true.

10:26.843 --> 10:30.630
We have some of
the best dark secrets,
as countries go.

10:30.673 --> 10:32.022
Then it's settled!

10:32.066 --> 10:35.243
We are going on
an Addams family vacation!

10:39.203 --> 10:40.944
Come on, kids.

10:40.988 --> 10:44.948
Feast your eyes
on the old Addams camper.

10:44.992 --> 10:46.820
Thing's been fixing it up.

10:53.696 --> 10:54.871
It's a hybrid.

10:54.915 --> 10:57.482
Half car, half eyesore.

10:57.526 --> 11:00.224
Mother, Father, this is cruel.

11:00.268 --> 11:02.139
Even for you.

11:03.793 --> 11:06.230
-That's the spirit, Lurch.
-

11:08.145 --> 11:10.191
-Ha-ha!

11:10.234 --> 11:11.671
Let's go, Wednesday.

11:11.714 --> 11:13.977
It's time
for some family bonding.

11:14.021 --> 11:16.676
Whether you like it or not.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.200
You see, Wednesday,

11:19.243 --> 11:20.854
this trip will bring
the Addams family

11:20.897 --> 11:23.552
closer than ever before.

11:25.772 --> 11:28.383
Or there will be no survivors.

11:28.949 --> 11:30.428
Hello?

11:30.472 --> 11:32.126
Anybody home?

11:32.169 --> 11:33.214
Hello?

11:33.257 --> 11:34.345
Mr. Addams?

11:35.303 --> 11:37.305
Hello, good sir!

11:37.348 --> 11:38.349
I am Gomez Addams.

11:39.655 --> 11:42.049
And this is my wife, Morticia.

11:42.092 --> 11:43.528
Charmed.

11:43.572 --> 11:45.095
I'll get right to the point.

11:45.139 --> 11:46.749
My name is Mustela.

11:46.793 --> 11:50.231
I'm a lawyer
representing a couple
in Sausalito, California.

11:50.274 --> 11:52.015
Recent evidence
has come to light

11:52.059 --> 11:54.670
that on the night of
my client's daughter's birth,

11:54.714 --> 11:56.237
she may have been switched

11:56.280 --> 11:58.456
with another child
at the hospital.

11:58.500 --> 12:03.026
Namely, a Wednesday Addams.

12:03.070 --> 12:04.549
-

12:07.074 --> 12:09.119
Ooh, hilarious!

12:09.163 --> 12:13.123
All this, just to get out
of a family road trip.

12:13.167 --> 12:15.082
How much did Wednesday
pay you?

12:15.125 --> 12:16.648
Excuse me?

12:16.692 --> 12:19.129
Oh! Sorry, sorry,
where are my manners?

12:19.173 --> 12:21.828
I think he's expecting a tip.

12:21.871 --> 12:24.787
No, I'm expecting
a DNA sample.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.615
If you'll bring
the child here, we can--

12:26.658 --> 12:29.357
I never seem to have a tip.

12:29.400 --> 12:30.750
-I do.

12:30.793 --> 12:33.578
Great Uncle Zander left me
these tips in his will.

12:33.622 --> 12:35.711
I knew one day
they'd come in handy.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.844
There you go, my good man.

12:37.887 --> 12:40.411
Well played.
Very amusing indeed.

12:40.455 --> 12:42.370
I assure you, Mr. Addams,

12:42.413 --> 12:45.547
there's nothing amusing
about this.

12:45.590 --> 12:48.942
And this is far from over!

12:48.985 --> 12:51.161
I can't believe
he gave me the finger.

12:52.423 --> 12:55.426
Mother, Father,
who was that man?

12:55.470 --> 12:57.298
Very funny, Wednesday.

12:57.341 --> 12:59.039
Nice try.

12:59.082 --> 13:01.345
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

13:01.389 --> 13:02.956
Who was he?

13:05.697 --> 13:07.351
No one for you
to worry about.

13:07.395 --> 13:08.700
No one at all, dear.

13:09.614 --> 13:10.615
Hmm.

13:11.921 --> 13:13.488
Thank you
for watching the house

13:13.531 --> 13:14.881
while we're gone, Grandma.

13:14.924 --> 13:17.405
It's such a relief
to know it's in safe hands.

13:17.448 --> 13:19.015
Oh, please.

13:19.059 --> 13:22.453
Trust me, these hands
have cracked many safes.

13:22.497 --> 13:25.674
Thing, let the vacation
commence!

13:27.371 --> 13:28.590
Let's roll!

13:39.383 --> 13:41.472
Bye! Farewell!

13:41.516 --> 13:44.258
Adios!Toodle-oo!

13:44.301 --> 13:46.260
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
I thought they'd never leave.

13:46.303 --> 13:49.219
Let's party!

13:51.352 --> 13:53.049
You read my mind, chuckles.

13:53.093 --> 13:54.834
Time to make some money.

14:02.493 --> 14:03.581
I thought that first,

14:03.625 --> 14:06.236
we shall pay our respects
to the immolated

14:06.280 --> 14:08.369
in the witch-haunted city
of Salem.

14:08.412 --> 14:12.416
Then, in the great
nomadic tradition
of our ancestors,

14:12.460 --> 14:16.333
we'll flit hither and thither
across this great nation

14:16.377 --> 14:17.682
until we reach

14:17.726 --> 14:19.815
-our final destination.
-

14:19.859 --> 14:23.819
The place on Earth
where people are happiest!

14:23.863 --> 14:25.952
Death Valley!

14:26.909 --> 14:28.302
We'll be gone
for three weeks.

14:28.345 --> 14:30.130
Three weeks?

14:30.173 --> 14:32.306
You're both growing up
so fast.

14:32.349 --> 14:33.916
Soon, you'll move out,

14:33.960 --> 14:35.526
and it'll be nice
to have a memory

14:35.570 --> 14:36.876
we could look back upon.

14:36.919 --> 14:39.574
No matter how terrible.

14:39.617 --> 14:41.271
Ooh, like prom night.

14:45.319 --> 14:48.539
'Bout to go global

14:50.541 --> 14:52.935
I can't believe the boss
made me bring backup.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.806
No offense,
I just really don't see

14:54.850 --> 14:56.373
what you bring
to the table.

14:57.374 --> 14:58.985
All I know is,

14:59.028 --> 15:01.509
if we don't get that girl
and bring her back
to Sausalito,

15:01.552 --> 15:02.989
we'll both be fired.

15:04.251 --> 15:06.775
Oh, ugh. Mint?

15:06.818 --> 15:08.385
You know what? Take 'em all.

15:21.442 --> 15:23.966
'Bout to go global

15:34.368 --> 15:35.935
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
And then it goes...

15:41.766 --> 15:43.943
Anyway, it's not finished yet,

15:43.986 --> 15:46.336
but it's my best
rock opera yet.

15:46.380 --> 15:48.773
I'm calling it Rocktapus.

15:48.817 --> 15:50.340
I wrote it in the bath.

15:50.384 --> 15:53.169
I've been taking
a lot of baths recently.

15:53.213 --> 15:54.518
You know, I think it's...

15:58.522 --> 16:01.961
All that beautiful water!

16:03.266 --> 16:04.964
Forget Salem!
We know how it turned out.

16:05.007 --> 16:06.356
Change of plans.

16:24.070 --> 16:26.202
Thing, how did this happen?

16:26.246 --> 16:27.812
We were supposed
to be in Salem.

16:29.858 --> 16:31.816
Ah, don't be mad, brother.

16:31.860 --> 16:34.428
Niagara Falls is
the great Wonder of the World

16:34.471 --> 16:36.952
and kills the most tourists

16:36.996 --> 16:39.868
with its powerful, seductive

16:44.568 --> 16:46.831
Fester? Fester?

16:46.875 --> 16:48.703
Hey, Fester.
-

16:48.746 --> 16:49.965
Are you feeling all right?

16:50.009 --> 16:52.576
You're not your usual
creepy self.

16:52.620 --> 16:53.838
Not especially.

16:53.882 --> 16:55.318
Will you take a look at this?

16:55.362 --> 16:57.320
-Does this seem off to you?
-

16:57.364 --> 16:58.713
It smells okay,

16:58.756 --> 17:00.497
but make sure to put it
in the fridge.

17:00.541 --> 17:02.064
Seafood turns very quickly.

17:04.501 --> 17:06.025
Having fun?

17:06.068 --> 17:10.203
I'm staring at Canada,
if that answers
your question.

17:10.246 --> 17:11.943
I'm sorry, Wednesday.

17:11.987 --> 17:13.554
I know how much
you wanted to see

17:13.597 --> 17:16.035
where girls your age
were burned at the stake.

17:16.078 --> 17:17.210
What did you call them again?

17:17.732 --> 17:20.126
Squad goals.

17:20.169 --> 17:22.258
What do you say
we do a little exploring?

17:22.302 --> 17:23.346
Just us.

17:23.390 --> 17:25.435
I saw a vintage store
in town.

17:25.479 --> 17:28.699
Maybe it's time for you
to try out a more mature look.

17:30.310 --> 17:32.877
The little black dress
is a classic, Mother.

17:32.921 --> 17:34.575
There's my little holy terror.

17:36.011 --> 17:38.361
You know how I feel
about hugs, Father.

17:42.017 --> 17:45.238
Did you know dozens of people
tried to go over these falls

17:45.281 --> 17:46.717
in wooden barrels?

17:46.761 --> 17:48.284
Does anyone survive?

17:48.328 --> 17:50.852
Some do. Some don't.

17:50.895 --> 17:54.682
I hear it's a barrel of fun.

17:54.725 --> 17:56.684
-

17:56.727 --> 18:00.122
Pugsley, have you ever worn
a coat of live bees?

18:00.166 --> 18:02.603
OMG.

18:02.646 --> 18:04.692
I should totes take a selfie
of this moment.

18:06.128 --> 18:08.957
Ah! This is
the perfect opportunity

18:09.000 --> 18:10.872
to try out the moves
in my book.

18:10.915 --> 18:12.178
The key with women

18:12.221 --> 18:14.745
is to make a strong
first impression.

18:14.789 --> 18:16.312
You mean like a bad smell?

18:16.356 --> 18:17.922
Well, that goes
without saying.

18:17.966 --> 18:21.709
What I mean is,
it's important
to make a big splash.

18:21.752 --> 18:23.276
Are you with me, kid?

18:26.322 --> 18:27.410
-

18:27.454 --> 18:28.629
-Huh?
- Ouch!

18:28.672 --> 18:30.587
I just skinned my knee

18:30.631 --> 18:32.459
falling for you.

18:34.591 --> 18:36.593
That's so corny.

18:36.637 --> 18:39.379
Ugh. Did you get that
from a book?

18:39.422 --> 18:40.641
-Uh-oh. Uh...
-

18:40.684 --> 18:42.947
Leave this to me.

18:42.991 --> 18:45.515
Excuse me, vacuous lemmings.

18:47.822 --> 18:49.737
Oh, come on.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.134
-

18:59.529 --> 19:01.879
Let me begin

19:01.923 --> 19:04.447
Battle me, that's a sin

19:04.491 --> 19:06.362
Punk, you better back up

19:06.406 --> 19:07.929
And, yo

19:07.972 --> 19:09.365
-

19:09.409 --> 19:10.845
I came to get down

19:10.888 --> 19:12.020
And jump around

19:13.152 --> 19:14.283
-

19:19.549 --> 19:21.986
And get down!

19:24.032 --> 19:26.904
Jump! Jump!

19:34.869 --> 19:37.915
Madison,
would you do me the honor
of becoming my wife?

19:37.959 --> 19:39.352
-

19:39.395 --> 19:41.789
Help!

19:41.832 --> 19:43.225
Is that a maybe?

19:51.146 --> 19:53.366
-

20:00.547 --> 20:02.897
Right in the Niagara balls!

20:07.467 --> 20:09.295
Nobody is renting barrels.

20:09.338 --> 20:12.167
I had to buy 300 pickles
just to get these.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.647
You go that way.
I'll look over here.

20:13.690 --> 20:14.561
Gomez, look.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.520
Isn't that the weaselly man

20:17.564 --> 20:19.609
who came to the house
looking for Wednesday?

20:19.653 --> 20:22.786
Well, I have to admit,
I admire the man's tenacity.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.048
Wednesday, let's try

20:24.092 --> 20:26.616
a little family trust-building
exercise.

20:26.660 --> 20:28.879
-I don't believe in exercise.
- Sorry!

20:36.583 --> 20:41.109
Excelsior!Whoo-hoo-hoo!

20:42.719 --> 20:44.243
-Hey, hey, wait for me!

20:44.286 --> 20:46.245
I wanna go in the water too!

20:53.991 --> 20:56.342
Help! Pongo!

20:56.385 --> 20:58.344
Guess that takes care of that.

20:59.170 --> 21:00.781
Hey, where's Pugsley?

21:02.217 --> 21:04.654
Well, look at this,
a tiny floating person.

21:04.698 --> 21:06.134
-

21:06.177 --> 21:07.614
Oh! There he is.

21:11.313 --> 21:13.794
How great was that, Wednesday?

21:13.837 --> 21:15.665
And we both survived.

21:15.709 --> 21:17.928
Another thing
we have in common.

21:17.972 --> 21:20.279
Okay, what's going on?

21:20.322 --> 21:21.584
Whatever do you mean?

21:21.628 --> 21:22.933
Father.

21:22.977 --> 21:25.458
His erratic behavior.

21:25.501 --> 21:27.808
This last-minute family trip
to make memories.

21:27.851 --> 21:29.288
Giving hugs.

21:29.331 --> 21:30.680
It's torture.

21:30.724 --> 21:31.986
And not the fun kind,

21:32.029 --> 21:35.032
like putting leeches
in Pugsley's briefs.

21:35.076 --> 21:37.731
Anyway, I'm quite sure
he's dying.

21:37.774 --> 21:39.341
-What?
-Don't worry.

21:39.385 --> 21:40.777
I won't tell Pugsley.

21:40.821 --> 21:41.952
Not yet.

21:41.996 --> 21:44.085
He'll enjoy the surprise.

21:44.128 --> 21:48.611
But if you're afraid
to ask my permission
to take a new lover,

21:48.655 --> 21:50.221
just know you have it.

21:50.265 --> 21:52.223
-

21:58.795 --> 22:01.494
Dropped out of school

22:01.537 --> 22:04.584
Ouch!
Mom, tell her to stop!

22:04.627 --> 22:06.586
Please,
darlings, quiet down.

22:06.629 --> 22:08.370
I'm trying to find a signal.

22:09.632 --> 22:11.591
-

22:12.766 --> 22:13.984
Ow!

22:14.028 --> 22:15.508
-Mom, help!
-

22:15.551 --> 22:17.597
Gomez, have you heard
from your mother yet?

22:17.640 --> 22:19.599
She's not answering my texts.

22:19.642 --> 22:21.775
Oh, she's probably having
an early night.

22:21.818 --> 22:25.779
The woman is almost
102 years old, after all.

22:25.822 --> 22:27.781
-Whoo!

22:27.824 --> 22:29.348
-

22:32.655 --> 22:33.874
Whoo-hoo!

22:33.917 --> 22:35.397
-We're here for the party!

22:36.006 --> 22:37.530
Whoop-la!

22:37.573 --> 22:38.618
Tickets, please!

22:38.661 --> 22:42.099
Wow, this place
is a whole mood.

22:42.143 --> 22:45.538
Well, if you're
in the mood to party,

22:45.581 --> 22:47.409
step right this way.

22:47.453 --> 22:49.977
Whoa!
This plant totes slaps!

22:50.020 --> 22:53.023
No, darling, she snaps.

22:53.067 --> 22:54.982
-Oh, don't worry, don't worry.

22:55.025 --> 22:56.984
She's on a vegan diet.

22:57.027 --> 23:00.857
In that she only eats vegans.

23:00.901 --> 23:02.293
And who's the headliner?

23:02.337 --> 23:04.948
Uh... Uh... The Talking Heads.

23:04.992 --> 23:05.949
For reals?

23:05.993 --> 23:07.211
Uh, yeah, yeah.

23:07.255 --> 23:08.648
Uh, they're right over there.

23:11.477 --> 23:13.130
-

23:13.174 --> 23:16.438
On you, ooh, ooh

23:17.918 --> 23:20.007
Um... I didn't pay $500
to watch a bunch of puppets.

23:20.050 --> 23:21.443
What?

23:21.487 --> 23:23.271
Do you know how hard it is
to decapitate

23:23.314 --> 23:24.925
an entire barber shop quartet?

23:26.970 --> 23:29.190
Ew! Refund, please.

23:30.452 --> 23:31.888
Let's not be hasty.

23:31.932 --> 23:34.369
I was just joking.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.979
I don't want to ruin
the surprise.

23:36.023 --> 23:37.981
And... And trust me,

23:38.025 --> 23:41.289
the headliner will make
serious headlines.

23:42.856 --> 23:44.510
-

23:51.473 --> 23:53.344
It was
the dead of night.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.828
-The witching hour.
-

23:58.872 --> 24:00.439
The wolf howled.

24:03.746 --> 24:06.880
And then she heard
a scratching at the door.

24:06.923 --> 24:08.534
Scratch,

24:08.577 --> 24:10.057
scratch,

24:10.100 --> 24:12.189
scratch.

24:12.233 --> 24:15.541
She slowly opened it to reveal

24:16.106 --> 24:17.934
a puppy!

24:17.978 --> 24:20.241
-And around its neck

24:20.284 --> 24:21.503
was a bow!

24:22.809 --> 24:25.855
-Mm. Gomez.
-

24:25.899 --> 24:28.510
You remember
when I first told you
that one, Pugsley?

24:28.554 --> 24:30.730
You must've been
two months old.

24:30.773 --> 24:34.342
Oh, you'd scream and scream
until you wet yourself.

24:34.385 --> 24:36.518
Some things never change.

24:38.564 --> 24:40.348
She's not back yet.

24:40.391 --> 24:41.958
She said
she wanted to be alone,

24:42.002 --> 24:44.091
but how long does that take?

24:44.134 --> 24:45.788
-There she is.

24:45.832 --> 24:47.877
How did it go out there,
Wednesday?

24:47.921 --> 24:49.488
Did Kitty do
his business?

24:49.531 --> 24:50.489
Indeed.

24:52.447 --> 24:53.970
Ew!
-Come, come. Join us.

24:54.014 --> 24:56.582
We were just telling stories
of when Pugsley was born.

24:56.625 --> 24:58.888
He kept us up all night,
howling.

24:58.932 --> 25:00.716
Wednesday,
you were the opposite.

25:00.760 --> 25:02.022
I've never heard of a baby

25:02.065 --> 25:04.328
being completely
silent before.

25:04.372 --> 25:05.721
-Ah, yes,

25:05.765 --> 25:08.115
I remember the night
Wednesday was born.

25:08.158 --> 25:09.725
It was a Tuesday.

25:09.769 --> 25:12.685
All tucked in tight
in the hospital nursery.

25:12.728 --> 25:15.383
She was silent as a jellyfish.

25:15.426 --> 25:18.386
Even when
all the other little babies
started bawling.

25:18.429 --> 25:20.344
What do you mean?

25:20.388 --> 25:22.782
Oh, I never
told you this story?

25:23.957 --> 25:26.699
Start talking.

25:26.742 --> 25:28.352
Well, I was looking
for a bathroom

25:28.396 --> 25:30.964
because I'd eaten all
of the patients' pudding

25:31.007 --> 25:32.879
that they left behind,

25:32.922 --> 25:35.751
when I took a wrong turn
into the hospital nursery.

25:38.058 --> 25:39.886
-

25:39.929 --> 25:41.844
-

25:44.630 --> 25:46.545
And that's when
I spotted her.

25:50.200 --> 25:53.595
I just wanted to get
a better look
at my new niece.

25:53.639 --> 25:55.597
But a bunch
of the babies started

25:55.641 --> 25:57.207
wailing their heads off.

25:57.251 --> 26:01.037
So, I remembered the age-old
Addams family nursery trick.

26:13.093 --> 26:15.356
And sure enough,
they all fell asleep.

26:17.663 --> 26:20.187
And I put all the babies back
where I found them.

26:21.405 --> 26:22.493
I think.

26:24.670 --> 26:26.193
-Pretty sure.
-

26:30.458 --> 26:32.416
-Kitty needs a walk.
-Right away.

26:32.460 --> 26:33.504
But I just walked--

26:33.548 --> 26:36.116
Fester,
you're in charge.

26:36.159 --> 26:38.771
I wonder if I could
juggle actual children.

26:38.814 --> 26:41.077
Wednesday, Pugsley,
bring it in, let's find out.

26:41.121 --> 26:43.036
You never know until you try.

26:43.079 --> 26:44.254
-And if one of you

26:44.298 --> 26:46.343
falls on your head,
well, lesson learned.

26:46.387 --> 26:49.825
Hard to believe
women don't want
to talk to either of you.

26:51.697 --> 26:54.569
Gomez,
what if what
that lawyer said is true?

26:54.613 --> 26:57.050
These people
are not going to give up.

26:57.093 --> 27:00.053
They'll keep coming
until they take her away.

27:00.096 --> 27:01.315
Let him come!

27:01.358 --> 27:03.970
They shall know us
by our trail of dead.

27:04.013 --> 27:06.886
Ugh.
That's your answer
to everything.

27:06.929 --> 27:08.757
I only wish

27:08.801 --> 27:10.890
I did have the answer
for it, querida.

27:14.894 --> 27:17.200
Tish! That's it.

27:17.244 --> 27:20.290
I may not have the answer,
but I know someone who will.

27:20.334 --> 27:21.988
I hope so.

27:22.031 --> 27:24.686
Whatever we do,
we can't let
Wednesday find out

27:24.730 --> 27:26.645
she might not be our daughter.

27:31.998 --> 27:33.782
Could it be true?

27:33.826 --> 27:37.830
Could I have been misplaced
in my infancy?

27:37.873 --> 27:41.050
Grown up with a delusion
that I am one person,

27:41.094 --> 27:46.708
when in fact, I am someone
completely different.

27:46.752 --> 27:51.800
Now this is the origin story
an innovator like me deserves.

27:51.844 --> 27:54.934
It would make
a fascinating first chapter
in my memoir.

27:55.935 --> 27:57.023
Can you imagine?

28:01.984 --> 28:03.420
Come on, kids!

28:03.464 --> 28:05.292
Up and Addams!

28:06.336 --> 28:08.948
Thing, head south.

28:08.991 --> 28:12.952
What we need is a little
old-fashioned Addams fun!

28:12.995 --> 28:14.388
Ha-ha!

28:23.136 --> 28:24.920
I got it. Oh!
There we go.

28:24.964 --> 28:25.921
Oh, dude!

28:27.836 --> 28:28.968
Hey, freak!

28:30.360 --> 28:31.840
-Pass it back!
-

28:32.362 --> 28:33.973
I'm not a freak.

28:35.931 --> 28:37.411
I'm a force of nature.

28:39.630 --> 28:41.415
Some force of nature.

28:41.458 --> 28:42.938
-So weak.
-

28:46.333 --> 28:48.117
Guys, you see this?

28:48.161 --> 28:49.989
-What's going on? what Is it?
-

28:57.648 --> 28:59.868
'Cause nobody can handle me

28:59.912 --> 29:01.348
Because I'm somethin'
They never seen

29:03.132 --> 29:04.830
I'm in love with myself

29:04.873 --> 29:06.701
When I'm feelin' myself

29:19.409 --> 29:20.846
Oh, my.

29:20.889 --> 29:23.849
It looks like
some unfortunate soul

29:23.892 --> 29:27.591
has dropped a small fortune
in the sand.

29:35.338 --> 29:37.645
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

29:37.688 --> 29:39.081
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

29:39.125 --> 29:42.171
-Lame!
-

29:42.215 --> 29:45.914
It looks like we need
to go over Chapter 3,

29:45.958 --> 29:48.656
"How to be Repulsive
and Impress Girls."

29:48.699 --> 29:49.875
I'll be right back.

29:49.918 --> 29:52.225
I gotta go use the bathroom.

29:52.268 --> 29:54.227
Yeah, yeah, yeah

29:54.270 --> 29:56.838
Yeah, yeah, yeah

29:59.710 --> 30:00.973
-

30:10.896 --> 30:13.028
Yeah, yeah, yeah

30:13.072 --> 30:14.856
Yeah, yeah, yeah

30:19.339 --> 30:20.166
Shark! Shark!

30:33.527 --> 30:34.920
Run for your lives!

30:40.055 --> 30:42.014
Hyah! See?

30:42.057 --> 30:44.799
Now that's how
you attract attention.

30:48.716 --> 30:51.501
Ah! There he is.

30:51.545 --> 30:54.113
The man we came to see.

31:06.255 --> 31:08.997
Ladies, what do ladies say?

31:10.738 --> 31:12.827
We got your back"

31:17.223 --> 31:19.486
We got your back"

31:19.529 --> 31:22.619
We beat it till we beat it

31:22.663 --> 31:24.839
can give it to us
'Cause you know we need it

31:24.883 --> 31:26.275
It!

31:26.319 --> 31:29.496
Good to see you,
my bewhiskered cousin.

31:29.539 --> 31:32.020
-You made it.
-

31:32.064 --> 31:35.110
Mm. It's in Florida
for spring break.

31:35.154 --> 31:37.983
Ghouls Gone Wild, am I right?

31:38.026 --> 31:39.288
He's going to join us
on our trip.

31:39.332 --> 31:40.768
Hold on.

31:40.811 --> 31:42.813
He's coming in the camper?

31:42.857 --> 31:44.685
We're cramped enough as it is.

31:44.728 --> 31:46.687
And he sheds, Morticia.

31:46.730 --> 31:48.645
Oh, Fester, he's family.

31:48.689 --> 31:50.517
The more the hairier.

31:50.560 --> 31:53.259
Well, if he's allowed
on the couch, then so am I!

31:55.348 --> 31:57.524
-

31:59.178 --> 32:01.093
-

32:01.136 --> 32:02.355
No, no, no!

32:02.398 --> 32:03.834
I said cut the red wire.

32:06.011 --> 32:09.362
I can't believe Taylor Swift
wants to date me.

32:09.405 --> 32:11.103
Me.

32:11.146 --> 32:12.887
Make sure to close the door

32:12.931 --> 32:16.586
when you go into outer space.

32:16.630 --> 32:21.765
Yes, Beyonce,
I would love to share
my ham with you.

32:23.419 --> 32:25.595
-

32:25.639 --> 32:28.511
Weighed empty

32:31.645 --> 32:34.865
Was a bone to be chewed

32:34.909 --> 32:38.782
Of November came early

32:43.091 --> 32:44.875
-

32:44.919 --> 32:47.530
In Wisconsin

32:49.271 --> 32:52.361
It was bigger than most

32:52.405 --> 32:54.059
-

33:05.505 --> 33:08.812
I thought you were a leader

33:08.856 --> 33:11.598
You're only a deleter

33:23.784 --> 33:25.612
-

33:25.655 --> 33:27.614
Morticia, I told you so.

33:27.657 --> 33:29.442
There's hairballs everywhere.

33:31.574 --> 33:34.447
Yeah, and the same
to you, fuzzface.

33:42.672 --> 33:44.457
How could you tell?

33:51.333 --> 33:55.424
Did it ever bother you
that you were so different

33:55.468 --> 33:57.339
from the rest of the family?

34:00.038 --> 34:01.648
A rebellious phase?

34:05.043 --> 34:08.916
You shaved your entire body
as a teenager?

34:12.833 --> 34:16.706
Oh. So that's what changed.

34:16.750 --> 34:18.665
You owned who you were.

34:21.668 --> 34:23.757
That's the problem.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.541
I don't know who I am.

34:29.850 --> 34:32.592
- Get over here ASAP.

34:32.635 --> 34:34.855
I went too far this time
and things are getting hairy!

34:34.898 --> 34:36.117
No offense.

34:44.908 --> 34:46.475
-Let's do this!
-

34:49.174 --> 34:50.131
-

34:53.743 --> 34:55.745
It's that lawyer, Gomez.

34:55.789 --> 34:57.182
He's found us again.

34:57.225 --> 34:58.966
He wants what we have.

34:59.009 --> 35:01.316
Well, he won't get her.

35:01.360 --> 35:02.752
-Good, Pugsley.

35:02.796 --> 35:04.537
Right this way.

35:06.365 --> 35:08.323
How about a fun
family travel game?

35:08.367 --> 35:09.672
Everyone around the table.

35:09.716 --> 35:10.934
Ugh.

35:10.978 --> 35:12.893
-

35:22.859 --> 35:23.904
-

35:30.867 --> 35:32.130
So, what shall we play?

35:34.349 --> 35:36.308
How about Punch Buggy?

35:36.351 --> 35:37.744
Punch...

35:38.788 --> 35:40.747
-...buggy.

35:45.708 --> 35:47.101
-

35:53.890 --> 35:54.978
We need to step on it.

35:55.022 --> 35:56.545
And we'll need a place
to hide.

35:56.589 --> 35:58.634
I have just the place,
querida.

36:00.158 --> 36:01.855
-Thing, turn here.
-

36:02.725 --> 36:03.422
Look out!

36:25.748 --> 36:27.750
You sure this is
the right place, Pop?

36:27.794 --> 36:29.230
Yes, son.

36:29.274 --> 36:32.451
The Alamo.

36:32.494 --> 36:36.281
You can sense
that many lives
were lost here.

36:36.324 --> 36:39.240
Let us take a moment
to pay our respects.

36:42.417 --> 36:44.289
-

36:46.726 --> 36:48.510
Okay. Enough respect.

36:48.554 --> 36:49.685
Everyone in!

36:57.780 --> 36:59.652
-

36:59.695 --> 37:02.307
Look at y'all's costumes!

37:03.830 --> 37:06.920
You guys are a little early
for the Halloween pageant.

37:06.963 --> 37:11.098
Today, we're on the hunt
for our next
Little Miss Jalapeno Pepper.

37:13.970 --> 37:15.233
Hello?
Wednesday!

37:15.276 --> 37:16.886
-Wednesday Addams!

37:16.930 --> 37:19.672
Are you in there? Hello?

37:19.715 --> 37:22.370
Well, burn my biscuits.

37:22.414 --> 37:24.938
This here's
our little tumbleweed.

37:24.981 --> 37:27.636
And she's a-fixin' to be
the Lone Star

37:27.680 --> 37:30.117
-of this here rodeo!
-What?

37:30.160 --> 37:31.771
Well, in that case,

37:31.814 --> 37:34.730
we better get you
all gussied up, hon.

37:34.774 --> 37:37.907
Father, this will not
end well for you.

37:39.735 --> 37:41.433
Wednesday!
-

37:41.476 --> 37:44.044
-

37:44.087 --> 37:45.785
Gomez, what are you doing?

37:45.828 --> 37:48.440
Just follow my lead.

37:48.483 --> 37:51.138
Howdy. We're oil tycoons.

37:51.181 --> 37:54.010
Oil tycoons? How can I...
Eesh!

37:54.054 --> 37:55.969
We're a-fixin'
to find ourselves

37:56.012 --> 37:59.320
some fancy new Texas threads.

37:59.364 --> 38:01.017
Will this be enough
to cover it?

38:02.932 --> 38:04.717
Mm.
-

38:04.760 --> 38:06.501
-

38:06.545 --> 38:08.111
Yeah! Check it out!

38:08.155 --> 38:10.026
Now just hold still,
sweetie.

38:10.070 --> 38:11.289
Make it tighter.

38:12.768 --> 38:13.900
Hi.

38:13.943 --> 38:15.336
What's your talent?

38:15.380 --> 38:17.512
I can read minds.

38:17.556 --> 38:18.774
No, you can't.

38:20.167 --> 38:22.169
Yes, I can.

38:22.212 --> 38:23.953
This isn't really happening.

38:23.997 --> 38:25.912
It is really happening.

38:25.955 --> 38:27.479
Think of a number.
Uh, number seven.

38:27.522 --> 38:29.089
-Seven.
-

38:29.132 --> 38:30.569
-Uh, purple.
-Purple.

38:30.612 --> 38:31.700
My worst nightmare.

38:31.744 --> 38:33.528
Hippopotamus riding a bicycle.

38:33.572 --> 38:34.921
What's your name?

38:34.964 --> 38:36.966
-Wednesday, what's yours?
-I don't wanna tell you.

38:38.228 --> 38:39.404
Hello, Peggy.

38:42.058 --> 38:43.233
I know.

38:43.277 --> 38:44.800
Just give me
the trophy already.

39:01.295 --> 39:04.080
I look like Uncle Sam
threw up all over me.

39:04.124 --> 39:06.779
Very good, Pugsley.
Blend in.

39:06.822 --> 39:09.042
If you have to interact
with any of the locals,

39:09.085 --> 39:12.872
remember, they're more afraid
of you than you are of them.

39:16.615 --> 39:18.530
-Oh, my word!

39:24.405 --> 39:26.886
These are
the perfect disguises.

39:26.929 --> 39:28.583
It's like we're invisible.

39:43.946 --> 39:45.470
We're dead, Gomez.

39:48.951 --> 39:51.693
-

39:51.737 --> 39:55.262
On my face?

39:58.961 --> 40:02.835
In the show tonight

40:02.878 --> 40:06.708
Really look so good?

40:08.188 --> 40:10.320
You think I should?

40:10.364 --> 40:14.063
If I blew a kiss?

40:14.107 --> 40:17.763
In the show tonight

40:21.201 --> 40:25.858
Ah. The only girls I see here
are perfectly normal.

40:25.901 --> 40:29.731
Is getting nearer

40:33.648 --> 40:37.391
In the mirror

40:37.435 --> 40:40.655
-Ugh!
-

40:42.875 --> 40:44.964
-

40:45.007 --> 40:48.446
Like I did a week ago

40:52.188 --> 40:54.495
In the show tonight

41:07.247 --> 41:09.771
-Brava! Bravissima!
-

41:09.815 --> 41:11.381
Hear, hear! Bella!

41:12.948 --> 41:14.254
There she is!

41:15.995 --> 41:17.736
Hey, y'all!

41:17.779 --> 41:21.391
That man right there
is one of the top
talent agents in the world!

41:25.395 --> 41:26.962
What?
-

41:30.966 --> 41:37.625
You rang?

41:39.018 --> 41:40.323
Quick, Lurch.

41:40.367 --> 41:41.977
-Grab Wednesday.
-

42:02.781 --> 42:03.912
Help!

42:03.956 --> 42:05.000
Pongo!

42:08.526 --> 42:10.353
-

42:11.224 --> 42:12.399
Hello. Hi.

42:15.445 --> 42:17.752
I'll find you,
Wednesday Addams!

42:23.932 --> 42:27.588
You have traumatized me
beyond all recognition.

42:27.632 --> 42:29.198
She looks the same to me.

42:29.242 --> 42:31.070
Who is that man?

42:31.113 --> 42:33.028
I know he's not
a talent agent.

42:33.072 --> 42:35.553
He's the same man
who came to the house.

42:39.339 --> 42:41.907
You're far too clever for us
to pull the wool
over your eyes.

42:43.038 --> 42:44.605
That man

42:44.649 --> 42:47.434
-is a door-to-door salesman.
-Gomez.

42:47.477 --> 42:49.349
And what is he selling?

42:49.392 --> 42:51.351
Uh... Tupperware?

42:51.394 --> 42:53.179
Knives? Makeup.

42:53.222 --> 42:55.007
Uh... Uh, frozen steaks.

42:55.050 --> 42:57.357
Life insurance for cows.

42:57.400 --> 42:58.576
Uh, they need it.

42:58.619 --> 43:01.361
The steak industry
is, oh, brutal.

43:02.928 --> 43:04.407
Okay.

43:04.451 --> 43:06.627
If that's the way
you want to play it.

43:06.671 --> 43:08.977
I'm going to go give
Pugsley a haircut.

43:09.021 --> 43:10.283
I think he's taking a nap.

43:11.240 --> 43:12.590
Exactly.

43:13.808 --> 43:14.722
That was easy.

43:25.124 --> 43:29.563
About the lonesome loser?

43:29.607 --> 43:33.698
Every time

43:36.657 --> 43:39.529
I'm not sure
Wednesday believed us.

43:39.573 --> 43:42.184
I'm sure she would have said
something if she didn't.

43:42.228 --> 43:45.144
If there's one thing
we can count on Wednesday for,
it's honesty.

43:45.187 --> 43:48.103
She certainly lets me know
when I'm embarrassing her

43:48.147 --> 43:49.365
or hovering

43:49.409 --> 43:51.585
-or being uncool.
-

43:54.762 --> 43:57.286
Children are like socks
in the laundry?

43:57.330 --> 44:00.463
They need to be lost
in order to be found?

44:00.507 --> 44:01.856
That's brilliant!

44:01.900 --> 44:03.162
Yes.

44:03.205 --> 44:05.730
We should find a place,
lie low for a while,

44:05.773 --> 44:08.907
and this whole thing
will just blow over.

44:08.950 --> 44:10.865
Lurch, old boy, top it off.

44:10.909 --> 44:12.824
We have places to be.

44:45.117 --> 44:47.075
Where's Kitty?
He needs a walk.

44:47.119 --> 44:48.424
He's asleep.

44:48.468 --> 44:51.732
He and It hit the catnip
pretty hard last night.

44:51.776 --> 44:53.255
[hip-hop music playing
on speaker]

44:53.299 --> 44:54.866
I got a hookup on the plug

44:56.258 --> 44:57.477
Ooh!

44:59.174 --> 45:00.262
Uh-oh.

45:01.394 --> 45:03.091
Yeah, I finally
got off diapers,

45:03.135 --> 45:04.745
so this is gonna happen.

45:04.789 --> 45:06.355
Gotta go clean myself up.

45:07.356 --> 45:08.531
-Pardon me.

45:08.575 --> 45:11.491
Gomez,
have you noticed changes

45:11.534 --> 45:13.754
in Fester's body lately?

45:13.798 --> 45:15.756
Hmm. Puberty?

45:29.117 --> 45:30.162
Oh!

45:30.205 --> 45:31.729
Huh?

45:33.208 --> 45:34.514
Ow!

45:34.557 --> 45:35.733
Oh!

45:39.040 --> 45:41.347
-

45:41.390 --> 45:44.393
A little privacy,
please.

45:50.486 --> 45:51.792
This doesn't look
so grand to me.

45:53.228 --> 45:55.796
The sheer emptiness.

45:55.840 --> 46:00.192
Cavernous abyss
of absolutely nothing.

46:00.235 --> 46:01.715
The vertigo.

46:01.759 --> 46:03.717
Intoxicating.

46:03.761 --> 46:05.284
It's just us,

46:05.327 --> 46:09.375
the captivating beauty
of the great American outdoors

46:09.418 --> 46:12.813
and the wonderful
sound of silence.

46:22.040 --> 46:23.868
Pugsley,
what do I keep saying?

46:23.911 --> 46:26.479
Amazon Prime is not a toy.

46:31.223 --> 46:33.007
[muffled hip-hop music

46:39.709 --> 46:42.103
Oh, it's for you. Huh.

46:42.147 --> 46:44.497
Well, do you really have
to leave us so soon, cousin?

46:44.540 --> 46:45.890
Where are you headed?

46:48.240 --> 46:51.547
I see. Top-secret gig.

46:51.591 --> 46:55.029
Tell that Billie Eilish
she's a little too sunny
for my taste.

46:55.073 --> 46:56.901
But I'm still a fan.

47:03.908 --> 47:06.475
Why didn't I get dating advice
from him?

47:20.185 --> 47:21.751
I have something for you.

47:25.712 --> 47:27.714
A tiny coffin.

47:27.757 --> 47:30.804
I fear I shall have trouble
getting Pugsley in here.

47:30.848 --> 47:32.371
No.

47:32.414 --> 47:35.026
Open it.

47:35.069 --> 47:37.855
Your grandmother
gave me this necklace
on my wedding day.

47:37.898 --> 47:39.682
It has been handed down

47:39.726 --> 47:42.033
through generations
of Addams women.

47:42.076 --> 47:44.687
It is a part of every Addams.

47:44.731 --> 47:46.341
Just as you are.

47:49.562 --> 47:51.477
Are you sure
this belongs to me?

47:52.391 --> 47:53.958
Of course, Wednesday.

47:54.001 --> 47:55.916
Who else would it belong to?

47:57.526 --> 47:59.006
Never mind.

47:59.050 --> 48:00.921
Thanks for the trinket,
Mother.

48:02.401 --> 48:03.793
Fire in the hole!

48:10.148 --> 48:11.932
Madison,
would you do me the honor--

48:32.605 --> 48:34.563
Now, that's grand.

48:34.607 --> 48:36.565
What was it you were saying
about laying low, darling?

48:37.131 --> 48:38.480
Hey!

48:38.524 --> 48:41.440
No more personal electronic
devices on this trip.

48:41.483 --> 48:43.659
Saddle up, Addams!

49:18.607 --> 49:21.001
You scurried fast,
little weasel.

49:21.045 --> 49:22.960
Please! Let me up!

49:23.003 --> 49:25.353
Where's your comically
large companion?

49:25.397 --> 49:29.444
That big ape ran out on me
at the Alamo.

49:29.488 --> 49:32.056
Please!
I'll tell you everything.

49:32.099 --> 49:33.883
-I'm listening.

49:36.016 --> 49:37.626
Oh!

49:40.281 --> 49:42.327
Mustela,
have you found the girl or...

49:42.370 --> 49:43.719
Ah.

49:43.763 --> 49:45.069
You got the drop on him.

49:45.678 --> 49:47.593
Mr. Strange.

49:47.636 --> 49:50.378
Please, call me Cyrus.

49:50.422 --> 49:52.815
Mr. Strange will suffice.

49:52.859 --> 49:54.513
What is this all about?

49:54.556 --> 49:57.081
It's about you, Wednesday.

49:57.124 --> 49:59.909
My wife and I were separated
from our true daughter

49:59.953 --> 50:02.042
on the night of her birth.

50:02.086 --> 50:04.697
I never gave up
trying to find her.

50:04.740 --> 50:07.091
I searched and searched
for years,

50:07.134 --> 50:10.050
and then, suddenly,
there I was,

50:10.094 --> 50:12.313
standing on that stage.

50:12.357 --> 50:14.011
Looking right at you.

50:14.924 --> 50:16.317
In that moment,

50:16.361 --> 50:20.539
I knew that you were
my long lost child.

50:20.582 --> 50:22.062
The physical similarities.

50:22.106 --> 50:25.022
The brilliant scientific mind.

50:25.065 --> 50:27.241
I did some digging.

50:27.285 --> 50:29.330
You were born
at the same hospital,

50:29.374 --> 50:31.985
the same day
as the girl we've raised.

50:32.029 --> 50:34.640
And as if meant to be,

50:34.683 --> 50:36.903
your name, Wednesday,

50:36.946 --> 50:39.297
is from my favorite poem.

50:39.340 --> 50:40.907
"Wednesday's child is..."

50:40.950 --> 50:43.127
"Full of woe."

50:43.170 --> 50:45.303
I was named after that poem.

50:45.346 --> 50:47.870
I live by it.

50:47.914 --> 50:49.568
I think we owe it to ourselves

50:49.611 --> 50:51.787
to get to the bottom of this,
Wednesday.

50:51.831 --> 50:54.442
Why don't you come
to my home in Sausalito?
We can...

50:54.486 --> 50:56.618
Not so fast.

50:56.662 --> 50:59.839
I have further research to
conduct to verify your claim.

50:59.882 --> 51:01.362
Of course.

51:01.406 --> 51:03.538
I would expect nothing less.

51:03.582 --> 51:05.975
By the way, what did you do
with Mr. Mustela?

51:06.585 --> 51:07.760
Oh.

51:07.803 --> 51:09.109
-I let him go.
-

51:56.635 --> 52:00.160
Tish. You minx.

52:05.644 --> 52:07.124
Let's settle this.

52:45.074 --> 52:47.381
It's all true.

52:49.166 --> 52:53.648
The facts before me prove
beyond a reasonable doubt

52:53.692 --> 52:56.303
that I am not an Addams.

52:56.347 --> 52:59.654
That means there's
only one logical choice.

52:59.698 --> 53:01.265
Don't you agree?

53:08.533 --> 53:09.577
Wednesday, dear.

53:11.753 --> 53:13.581
Come along, sleepyhead.

53:17.498 --> 53:19.370
Why, it's easier
to wake the dead

53:19.413 --> 53:20.936
than to wake you, my little...

53:22.068 --> 53:23.243
Hi, Mom.

53:25.114 --> 53:26.290
"Dear Addams family,

53:26.333 --> 53:27.682
As you may have noticed,

53:27.726 --> 53:31.033
our family dynamic
has been off-base lately.

53:31.077 --> 53:32.905
I have been ruminating on

53:32.948 --> 53:34.950
and questioning
the reason for this,

53:34.994 --> 53:38.867
but a new revelation has
resolved this doubt for me.

53:38.911 --> 53:40.042
I was the discordant note..."

53:40.086 --> 53:41.174
"I was the discordant note

53:41.218 --> 53:44.395
that can never resolve
into harmony.

53:44.438 --> 53:47.136
And the reason I could never
truly relate to any of you

53:47.789 --> 53:49.878
is simple.

53:49.922 --> 53:52.446
I am not your relative.

53:54.361 --> 53:57.712
I have no recourse
but to leave for good

53:57.756 --> 54:01.760
and make my way
toward the truth.

54:01.803 --> 54:03.805
Do not attempt to follow me."

54:08.288 --> 54:09.333
Wait.

54:09.376 --> 54:11.335
Wednesday's not an Addams?

54:11.378 --> 54:13.902
I'm the only real
Addams child?

54:13.946 --> 54:15.339
That's awesome!

54:15.382 --> 54:18.559
Too soon, Pugsley.
Too soon.

54:18.603 --> 54:20.082
-What does she mean,

54:20.126 --> 54:21.475
"making her way
toward the truth"?

54:21.519 --> 54:23.521
Is this about
the hospital thing

54:23.564 --> 54:25.349
that was totally
not a big deal?

54:25.392 --> 54:27.568
-This is all my fault.
-

54:27.612 --> 54:30.267
If she had
just felt closer to me,

54:30.310 --> 54:32.094
maybe this wouldn't
have happened.

54:32.138 --> 54:34.140
Thing! I need a Bloody Mary.

54:34.183 --> 54:35.359
Make it a double.

54:35.402 --> 54:36.795
He's in the shower.

54:39.798 --> 54:42.191
Don't forget to clean
behind your knuckles.

55:02.081 --> 55:04.910
Lurch, I can see you.

55:06.781 --> 55:09.131
Obviously,
I have failed in my duty

55:09.175 --> 55:11.046
as your lurking advisor.

55:13.875 --> 55:17.183
I really don't know
how to answer that.

55:17.226 --> 55:21.579
But what I do know is
that you should go back
to your family.

55:21.622 --> 55:24.582
It's time for me to find mine.

55:26.975 --> 55:28.977
I guess that's true.

55:29.021 --> 55:31.850
You're not an Addams either.

55:31.893 --> 55:34.200
How very sad that is.

55:35.984 --> 55:37.812
Much better, Lurch.

55:37.856 --> 55:40.162
It appears I taught you well,
after all.

55:42.904 --> 55:45.254
Like the Donner party
before us,

55:45.298 --> 55:49.302
we travel to California
to fulfil our destiny

55:49.346 --> 55:52.784
and eat what we must
along the way.

55:52.827 --> 55:56.962
Let us conquer the Golden West
or die trying.

55:57.005 --> 55:58.746
Lurch,

55:58.790 --> 56:00.531
-to Sausalito!
-

56:00.574 --> 56:02.837
Thing, to Sausalito!

56:02.881 --> 56:04.839
If we leave now,
we can catch up.

56:04.883 --> 56:07.668
Then we'll return home,
kidnap the necessary witnesses

56:07.712 --> 56:09.583
and snuff out
any remaining doubt

56:09.627 --> 56:11.368
that Wednesday is one of us.

56:11.411 --> 56:13.021
I love it when

56:13.065 --> 56:16.677
your murderous
maternal instincts kick in!

56:16.721 --> 56:19.027
We're back
in the parenting business!

56:19.071 --> 56:20.725
Come along, Addams.

56:20.768 --> 56:22.770
Let's bring Wednesday
back to her family.

56:26.861 --> 56:32.040
Ahem. Fester, your tentacles
are hanging out.

56:32.084 --> 56:33.999
I thought I felt a draft.

56:34.042 --> 56:35.435
Just don't kick 'em.

56:35.479 --> 56:36.871
They're very sensitive.

57:09.556 --> 57:12.472
All of those
do sound like great options,

57:12.516 --> 57:15.301
but which one
is the road to Sausalito?

57:33.798 --> 57:36.322
It's all the same to me

57:36.365 --> 57:38.280
-Out of my way, Hightower!

57:45.331 --> 57:46.811
Look, Lurch.

57:46.854 --> 57:50.815
Aggressive people who use
loud noises and fast rides

57:50.858 --> 57:53.948
to distract themselves
from their childhood trauma.

57:53.992 --> 57:55.472
Just what we need.

58:02.783 --> 58:05.960
The Ace of Spades

58:06.004 --> 58:07.353
-

58:15.404 --> 58:17.276
- Hmm.

58:17.885 --> 58:18.625
Huh?

58:27.982 --> 58:29.636
Hey!

58:29.680 --> 58:33.335
Ain't you the guy that almost
ran my bike off the road?

58:34.423 --> 58:36.904
And you must be Miss Lurleen?

58:40.778 --> 58:42.214
Excuse me?

58:43.607 --> 58:47.567
Ah. It seems I have offended
two people at once.

58:47.611 --> 58:48.699
How fortuitous.

58:49.787 --> 58:51.310
Huh?
-

58:51.353 --> 58:53.355
That was an insult too!

58:53.399 --> 58:55.880
-

58:55.923 --> 58:59.579
I'm afraid you gentlemen
have made a grave error.

58:59.623 --> 59:02.060
Lurch, show these cretins

59:02.103 --> 59:05.585
what your cold,
dead hands are capable of.

59:05.629 --> 59:07.631
Mm-hmm.

59:22.689 --> 59:26.432
Live without you by my side

59:26.475 --> 59:28.260
I should've been
more specific.

59:28.303 --> 59:29.478
But then
I spent so many nights

59:29.522 --> 59:30.871
How you did me wrong

59:32.786 --> 59:35.789
How to get along

59:39.663 --> 59:41.534
-

59:41.578 --> 59:43.841
-

59:43.884 --> 59:46.017
To find you here

59:46.060 --> 59:48.106
Upon your face

59:48.149 --> 59:49.890
That stupid lock

59:49.934 --> 59:52.632
Leave your key

59:52.676 --> 59:54.460
For just one second

1:00:02.250 --> 1:00:03.643
Welcome anymore

1:00:05.471 --> 1:00:08.692
To hurt me with goodbye?

1:00:10.868 --> 1:00:12.565
I'd lay down and die?

1:00:16.830 --> 1:00:19.485
How to love

1:00:21.400 --> 1:00:25.012
I've got all my love to give

1:00:25.056 --> 1:00:28.276
I will survive

1:00:28.320 --> 1:00:31.279
All I wanted
was a violent roadhouse melee

1:00:31.323 --> 1:00:33.891
before hitching
a ride to Sausalito.

1:00:33.934 --> 1:00:35.632
Was that too much to ask?

1:00:36.067 --> 1:00:37.459
Sausalito?

1:00:37.503 --> 1:00:39.331
That's exactly
where we're headed.

1:00:39.374 --> 1:00:42.029
It's the annual
Hug-A-Biker retreat

1:00:42.073 --> 1:00:44.597
where we deal
with our childhood trauma.

1:00:44.641 --> 1:00:46.512
I am good.

1:00:46.555 --> 1:00:49.297
Bring it in, little lady.

1:00:49.341 --> 1:00:51.038
I accept your offer of a ride.

1:00:51.082 --> 1:00:52.518
But if you don't mind,

1:00:52.561 --> 1:00:55.129
I will respectfully
decline the hug.

1:00:55.173 --> 1:00:57.697
I've been
social distancing
since birth.

1:01:01.962 --> 1:01:04.573
How to love

1:01:06.227 --> 1:01:08.273
All my life to live

1:01:08.316 --> 1:01:11.929
And I'll survive

1:01:34.908 --> 1:01:37.084
I know how to love...

1:01:37.128 --> 1:01:38.825
Sayonara,little lady.

1:01:40.087 --> 1:01:41.828
Whoo-hoo!

1:01:52.796 --> 1:01:55.189
It's all Jekyll, no Hyde.

1:01:59.541 --> 1:02:02.153
I feel something, Lurch.

1:02:02.196 --> 1:02:04.982
As though anticipation
and unease

1:02:05.025 --> 1:02:08.768
birthed some kind of
winged larvae in my stomach.

1:02:10.378 --> 1:02:12.990
Butterflies? Hmm.

1:02:13.033 --> 1:02:15.601
Perhaps my digestive acids
will kill them.

1:02:17.559 --> 1:02:19.736
Wednesday! You're here!

1:02:19.779 --> 1:02:21.694
Welcome home.

1:02:21.738 --> 1:02:24.566
Oh. I see you brought
a plus-one.

1:02:27.395 --> 1:02:28.701
fine. Perfectly fine.

1:02:32.183 --> 1:02:33.140
Right this way.

1:02:37.362 --> 1:02:38.842
-

1:02:40.321 --> 1:02:42.410
Wednesday, meet my wife.

1:02:44.195 --> 1:02:47.111
Uh, Ingrid has a touch
of laryngitis

1:02:47.154 --> 1:02:48.634
and finds it difficult to talk
at the moment.

1:02:48.677 --> 1:02:50.244
Hello.

1:02:50.288 --> 1:02:52.769
And this is Ophelia.

1:02:52.812 --> 1:02:55.772
Or as we call her,
our little Oaf.

1:02:56.642 --> 1:02:57.686
The other...

1:02:58.209 --> 1:02:59.384
...me.

1:03:00.689 --> 1:03:01.821
-Oh.

1:03:01.865 --> 1:03:03.867
Uh, Ingrid, my dear,

1:03:03.910 --> 1:03:06.043
why don't you rest for a while

1:03:06.086 --> 1:03:08.654
and I'll show
our little Wednesday around.

1:03:08.697 --> 1:03:10.525
Let's go see the laboratory.

1:03:10.569 --> 1:03:12.571
-Don't look at them.

1:03:14.486 --> 1:03:16.096
Right this way.

1:03:22.755 --> 1:03:24.844
Welcome to the future,
Wednesday.

1:03:26.454 --> 1:03:28.456
What do you think?

1:03:28.500 --> 1:03:31.242
Pretty boss, huh?

1:03:31.285 --> 1:03:32.809
You've got a lot
of projects in the works.

1:03:34.636 --> 1:03:35.942
Ready, Wednesday?

1:03:39.903 --> 1:03:42.035
When I did this DNA test
with Ophelia

1:03:42.079 --> 1:03:44.385
and it informed me
that she wasn't my daughter,

1:03:44.429 --> 1:03:46.561
I was unsurprised.

1:03:46.605 --> 1:03:49.477
Perhaps you can
relate to me on that.

1:03:49.521 --> 1:03:51.305
You see what I did there?

1:03:51.349 --> 1:03:52.872
I did,

1:03:52.916 --> 1:03:55.092
though I generally find puns
to be a lower form of humor.

1:03:55.527 --> 1:03:56.789
Hmm.

1:03:56.833 --> 1:04:00.271
My real passion
has always been...

1:04:01.272 --> 1:04:03.230
human behavior.

1:04:04.971 --> 1:04:07.887
What an incredible
coincidence.

1:04:07.931 --> 1:04:11.282
Exactly my thought when I saw
your winning experiment.

1:04:11.325 --> 1:04:13.632
Although,
if you think about it,

1:04:13.675 --> 1:04:15.939
not so coincidental.

1:04:15.982 --> 1:04:18.506
Like father, like daughter.
Am I right?

1:04:20.987 --> 1:04:23.250
We will find out shortly.

1:04:23.294 --> 1:04:26.558
And when we receive
the inevitable confirmation,

1:04:26.601 --> 1:04:29.691
I hope you'll reconsider
what you told me
at the fair.

1:04:29.735 --> 1:04:31.606
About how your formula

1:04:31.650 --> 1:04:34.087
-was a family secret.
-

1:04:34.131 --> 1:04:36.350
DNA sequencing complete.

1:04:37.699 --> 1:04:40.137
DNA match.

1:04:40.180 --> 1:04:42.443
Well, it's all settled.

1:04:42.487 --> 1:04:43.531
Done and...

1:04:45.577 --> 1:04:47.535
-Great.

1:04:47.579 --> 1:04:49.320
It's my fa... Uh...

1:04:50.234 --> 1:04:51.975
The Addams family.

1:04:52.018 --> 1:04:54.803
Well, let's go greet them.

1:04:58.807 --> 1:05:00.679
You guys go ahead, I...

1:05:01.593 --> 1:05:03.508
I'm gonna be going in, uh...

1:05:04.161 --> 1:05:06.163
I may be some time.

1:05:06.206 --> 1:05:07.686
-

1:05:17.565 --> 1:05:19.872
You

1:05:19.916 --> 1:05:23.093
rang?

1:05:23.136 --> 1:05:25.312
-Lurch.
-We're here
to rescue Wednesday.

1:05:25.356 --> 1:05:26.792
Rescue me from what?

1:05:28.837 --> 1:05:30.230
You!

1:05:30.274 --> 1:05:32.929
Cyrus Strange.
Pleased to meet you.

1:05:32.972 --> 1:05:35.366
You're the man
from the science fair.

1:05:35.409 --> 1:05:37.107
The ghostly apparition.

1:05:38.717 --> 1:05:40.545
Huh.

1:05:40.588 --> 1:05:42.764
I see you've been reanimated.

1:05:42.808 --> 1:05:44.984
And now, you've absconded
with our daughter

1:05:45.028 --> 1:05:46.812
and put her in this...
In...

1:05:46.855 --> 1:05:48.770
Wednesday,
what are you wearing?

1:05:48.814 --> 1:05:50.772
It's called a turtleneck.

1:05:50.816 --> 1:05:52.644
Deceptive name, I know,

1:05:52.687 --> 1:05:55.777
but it is both fashionable
and functional, M...

1:05:56.648 --> 1:05:58.476
Um, Morticia.

1:05:58.519 --> 1:06:01.087
- Mr. and Mrs. Addams,

1:06:01.131 --> 1:06:03.785
it appears
that you are not
Wednesday's parents.

1:06:03.829 --> 1:06:05.004
I am.

1:06:05.048 --> 1:06:07.006
Enough, you knave!

1:06:07.050 --> 1:06:10.618
Mr. Addams,
before you do anything rash,

1:06:10.662 --> 1:06:13.012
you might want to see this.

1:06:13.056 --> 1:06:16.015
The results conclusively prove

1:06:16.059 --> 1:06:19.018
that I am not your daughter.

1:06:20.063 --> 1:06:21.847
Where once I was Addams,

1:06:22.630 --> 1:06:23.892
now I am Strange.

1:06:24.763 --> 1:06:26.069
Zip it, Pugsley.

1:06:26.112 --> 1:06:27.592
This can't be true.

1:06:27.635 --> 1:06:30.290
I know this must be
quite a shock for you,

1:06:30.334 --> 1:06:31.378
Mr. and Mrs. Addams.

1:06:31.422 --> 1:06:32.684
Believe me,

1:06:32.727 --> 1:06:36.079
we went through
the same thing with Ophelia.

1:06:42.259 --> 1:06:43.260
Wow!

1:06:48.221 --> 1:06:51.659
Wednesday,
we're still your family.

1:06:51.703 --> 1:06:53.835
And that's why
I'd like to honor

1:06:53.879 --> 1:06:56.229
your contributions to my life

1:06:56.273 --> 1:06:59.928
with a proper
and respectful goodbye.

1:07:01.365 --> 1:07:03.671
Uh, Addams family, I...

1:07:03.715 --> 1:07:05.369
I want to say...

1:07:08.415 --> 1:07:11.592
It appears
I'm not quite ready
to part with them.

1:07:11.636 --> 1:07:13.072
Forgive me, Father.

1:07:13.116 --> 1:07:15.205
I do forgive you.

1:07:15.248 --> 1:07:17.033
Oh, no.

1:07:17.076 --> 1:07:18.773
I meant Cyrus.

1:07:18.817 --> 1:07:21.037
Come on, Wednesday.
You don't mean this.

1:07:21.080 --> 1:07:22.125
Let's just go home.

1:07:22.168 --> 1:07:23.865
We can talk about this
in the camper.

1:07:23.909 --> 1:07:26.085
I'm sorry, Mr. Addams.

1:07:26.129 --> 1:07:28.566
I can't leave with you.

1:07:28.609 --> 1:07:31.003
But maybe we can offer you

1:07:31.047 --> 1:07:33.527
and Mrs. Addams shelter
for the night?

1:07:33.571 --> 1:07:36.226
Then tomorrow
we can say goodbye.

1:07:36.269 --> 1:07:38.315
Of course, daughter.

1:07:38.358 --> 1:07:40.317
My man will show you
to the guest quarters.

1:07:52.068 --> 1:07:57.334
Of our house

1:08:04.036 --> 1:08:05.646
Something isn't right.

1:08:05.690 --> 1:08:07.170
Of course it's not.

1:08:07.213 --> 1:08:09.433
I've loved Wednesday
her whole life.

1:08:09.476 --> 1:08:11.652
I can't just stop because
a piece of paper says...

1:08:14.742 --> 1:08:15.874
Says...

1:08:21.097 --> 1:08:24.883
Wow. They really did
a lot in six hours.

1:08:33.109 --> 1:08:34.936
Oh, Tish.

1:08:34.980 --> 1:08:37.156
We've lost our little girl.

1:08:37.200 --> 1:08:41.726
Like happy people

1:08:45.033 --> 1:08:46.731
Hey!
-Wha...

1:08:58.873 --> 1:09:01.137
I thought my bedroom
was a mess.

1:09:01.180 --> 1:09:03.574
This is awesome!

1:09:03.617 --> 1:09:05.445
Hey, uh, are you hungry?

1:09:05.489 --> 1:09:06.968
I'm always hungry.

1:09:07.012 --> 1:09:08.405
Check it out.

1:09:12.452 --> 1:09:14.019
When my dad's not around,

1:09:14.062 --> 1:09:16.413
I don't use forks
or spoons

1:09:16.978 --> 1:09:18.415
or anything.

1:09:18.458 --> 1:09:19.851
Me either!

1:09:26.727 --> 1:09:28.990
It's a lot easier
to just use your face!

1:09:32.124 --> 1:09:33.778
Where have you been
all my life?

1:09:33.821 --> 1:09:35.345
The farm.

1:09:36.520 --> 1:09:37.608
Wait, what did you say?

1:09:41.916 --> 1:09:45.137
Cyrus Strange is lying.
I'm sure of it.

1:09:45.181 --> 1:09:46.486
But how do we prove it
to Wednesday that...

1:09:46.530 --> 1:09:48.227
Oh, querida.

1:09:48.271 --> 1:09:49.620
It's no use.

1:09:49.663 --> 1:09:51.056
Wednesday has gone.

1:09:51.099 --> 1:09:54.146
And now, we must do our duty.

1:09:54.190 --> 1:09:56.366
We shall raise
the pig girl and...

1:09:56.409 --> 1:09:58.063
Pull yourself together,
Gomez.

1:09:58.106 --> 1:09:59.586
You're an Addams.

1:09:59.630 --> 1:10:01.371
Just as Wednesday is.

1:10:01.414 --> 1:10:03.808
Whether it's in her blood
or not.

1:10:03.851 --> 1:10:05.723
- Mom. Pop.

1:10:05.766 --> 1:10:07.638
You have to see this!

1:10:10.902 --> 1:10:12.730
-

1:10:12.773 --> 1:10:14.471
What happened to these people?

1:10:14.514 --> 1:10:15.689
That's just it!

1:10:15.733 --> 1:10:17.387
I... I don't think
they are people.

1:10:17.430 --> 1:10:19.127
Your idiot boy
is right.

1:10:21.608 --> 1:10:24.481
They're animals
I imbued with human traits.

1:10:24.524 --> 1:10:26.787
Pretty neat, huh?

1:10:26.831 --> 1:10:30.443
They always revert back to
their original form, though.

1:10:30.487 --> 1:10:32.489
So that's why
you wanted Wednesday.

1:10:32.532 --> 1:10:35.709
Her experiment
did what you couldn't.

1:10:35.753 --> 1:10:38.973
Men. Just can't come out
and ask a woman for help,
can you?

1:10:39.017 --> 1:10:40.540
You faked that DNA test.

1:10:40.584 --> 1:10:42.412
Blah, blah, blah, blah!

1:10:42.455 --> 1:10:44.762
Oh, pipe down, Elvira!

1:10:44.805 --> 1:10:48.200
That's it! Prepare to meet
Old Deuteronomy!

1:10:48.244 --> 1:10:49.897
Mazurka!

1:11:00.386 --> 1:11:02.301
Oh, where are my manners?

1:11:02.345 --> 1:11:04.738
I forgot to thank you
for the tip!

1:11:04.782 --> 1:11:06.871
-

1:11:08.394 --> 1:11:10.440
I'm good! I'm so good!

1:11:28.109 --> 1:11:29.459
So sorry about that.

1:11:29.502 --> 1:11:30.938
Where were we?

1:11:30.982 --> 1:11:32.679
I have a surprise for you,
Father.

1:11:34.899 --> 1:11:36.944
Yes. Yes! Of course!

1:11:39.991 --> 1:11:42.123
But... But could it work?

1:11:48.391 --> 1:11:50.044
You did it!

1:11:50.088 --> 1:11:53.309
I knew funding those
science fairs would pay off.

1:11:53.352 --> 1:11:54.832
What was that?

1:11:54.875 --> 1:11:56.529
Uh... Nothing.

1:11:56.573 --> 1:12:00.316
I have a surprise for you
as well, Wednesday.

1:12:04.755 --> 1:12:08.019
They can be
our first test subjects.

1:12:08.062 --> 1:12:09.890
What have you done?

1:12:09.934 --> 1:12:11.544
I've got all manner

1:12:11.588 --> 1:12:14.460
of diabolical DNA
in these test tubes.

1:12:14.504 --> 1:12:16.767
You can isolate
the Addams' annoying habits

1:12:16.810 --> 1:12:19.726
and we'll replace them
with ones you want.

1:12:19.770 --> 1:12:21.511
But why?

1:12:21.554 --> 1:12:24.209
I saw you trying
to delay their departure.

1:12:24.252 --> 1:12:27.255
This way,
you can keep them around.

1:12:27.299 --> 1:12:29.170
I need my little protege
to be happy

1:12:29.214 --> 1:12:31.216
and focused on her work.

1:12:31.259 --> 1:12:33.740
This is important stuff
we are doing, Wednesday.

1:12:34.915 --> 1:12:37.048
World-changing!

1:12:37.091 --> 1:12:38.528
"World-changing"?

1:12:38.571 --> 1:12:40.312
If you could control people,

1:12:40.356 --> 1:12:43.750
Imbue them
with the strength and ferocity
of any animal on earth?

1:12:43.794 --> 1:12:46.013
Imagine who would pay
for that!

1:12:46.057 --> 1:12:48.451
The military,
foreign governments,

1:12:48.494 --> 1:12:50.104
call centers.

1:12:50.148 --> 1:12:52.803
They'd all want unstoppable
hybrid murder machines

1:12:52.846 --> 1:12:55.371
programmed down
to the cellular level!

1:12:55.414 --> 1:12:59.287
Imagine how rich
and famous we'll become!

1:12:59.331 --> 1:13:03.553
All thanks to your experiment!

1:13:03.596 --> 1:13:05.424
But I only meant to show

1:13:05.468 --> 1:13:08.035
how my Uncle Fester's
intellect could be improved.

1:13:08.079 --> 1:13:11.865
And now you get to improve
the rest of your ex-family.

1:13:14.868 --> 1:13:16.043
But they
don't need improving.

1:13:16.087 --> 1:13:18.263
They're fine as they are.

1:13:19.307 --> 1:13:21.353
Except for maybe Pugsley.

1:13:21.397 --> 1:13:24.748
But I'm the one who was
looking for change,

1:13:24.791 --> 1:13:26.140
not them.

1:13:26.184 --> 1:13:27.925
But this way, you'll never
have to feel different

1:13:27.968 --> 1:13:31.058
from anyone in your family
ever again, little boo-boo.

1:13:43.419 --> 1:13:45.246
Here you are, Wednesday.

1:13:45.290 --> 1:13:47.205
You do the honors.

1:13:49.816 --> 1:13:51.731
I won't!

1:13:51.775 --> 1:13:54.560
Even though you are
biologically my father,

1:13:54.604 --> 1:13:58.042
these people
are still my family.

1:13:58.085 --> 1:14:01.480
The Addams family.

1:14:01.524 --> 1:14:05.223
Fine. If you can't
pull the trigger, I'll do it!

1:14:20.020 --> 1:14:22.545
I'm disappointed in you,
Wednesday.

1:14:22.588 --> 1:14:26.636
But it appears you're just
a silly little girl
playing with science.

1:14:31.684 --> 1:14:34.513
Turn off the machine,
Mr. Strange.

1:14:35.209 --> 1:14:37.124
I won't ask you again.

1:14:38.517 --> 1:14:39.779
Aw!

1:14:39.823 --> 1:14:42.129
Is little lady threatening me?

1:14:42.173 --> 1:14:43.522
That depends.

1:14:43.566 --> 1:14:45.698
Do you have a piano nearby?

1:14:45.742 --> 1:14:48.309
Why would I have a piano
in a laboratory?

1:14:48.353 --> 1:14:51.312
In that case, Lurch...

1:14:52.575 --> 1:14:55.360
...show this cretin
what your cold,

1:14:55.403 --> 1:14:57.971
-dead hands are capable of.
-

1:14:58.015 --> 1:14:59.320
You think you're the only one

1:14:59.364 --> 1:15:01.758
with a brainless
Neanderthal bodyguard?

1:15:06.632 --> 1:15:10.070
-Kill, Pongo. Kill!

1:15:15.380 --> 1:15:16.903
Oh, this is gonna be rich!

1:15:19.950 --> 1:15:20.733
What?

1:15:23.344 --> 1:15:26.609
Eh! No! Pongo, you imbecile!

1:15:26.652 --> 1:15:28.959
I command you,
you protect me.

1:15:29.002 --> 1:15:31.439
You're wasting your breath.

1:15:31.483 --> 1:15:34.660
You see, Pongo and Lurch
are former cellmates

1:15:34.704 --> 1:15:36.836
at the asylum
where Lurch was held captive

1:15:36.880 --> 1:15:38.577
before my parents found him.

1:15:38.621 --> 1:15:40.405
Back in Texas,

1:15:40.448 --> 1:15:45.845
Pongo told Lurch
that he suspected
I was in danger.

1:15:45.889 --> 1:15:47.412
-I didn't believe it then.
- Pongo, Pongo.

1:15:47.455 --> 1:15:49.327
Bad boy, Pongo.
Bad boy.

1:15:49.370 --> 1:15:51.068
I was wrong.

1:15:51.111 --> 1:15:52.765
-No! No!

1:15:52.809 --> 1:15:54.288
That's gonna leave a mark.

1:15:57.335 --> 1:15:59.729
Stop! I had a big breakfast.

1:15:59.772 --> 1:16:01.644
Don't make me
puke up my pancakes!

1:16:01.687 --> 1:16:04.124
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1:16:08.825 --> 1:16:10.957
-

1:16:28.888 --> 1:16:30.977
Mother, Father,
are you all right?

1:16:31.021 --> 1:16:32.413
Yes, yes.

1:16:32.457 --> 1:16:36.200
Fortunately, we escaped
with no fatal wounds.

1:16:39.159 --> 1:16:40.683
Even Pugsley?

1:16:40.726 --> 1:16:42.510
Even Pugsley.

1:16:42.554 --> 1:16:45.165
Oh, well. Maybe next time.

1:16:45.209 --> 1:16:46.776
Wait, what?

1:16:58.526 --> 1:17:00.180
How very...

1:17:00.224 --> 1:17:01.878
touching.

1:17:03.314 --> 1:17:06.099
My real daughter would know
that sentimentality...

1:17:07.535 --> 1:17:10.060
is the antithesis of science.

1:17:10.103 --> 1:17:11.583
-That's right.
-

1:17:11.627 --> 1:17:14.455
I lied about the DNA...

1:17:14.499 --> 1:17:16.066
-re... re...
-

1:17:16.109 --> 1:17:17.502
...results.

1:17:17.545 --> 1:17:19.635
-

1:17:19.678 --> 1:17:22.507
I really should thank you,
Wednesday.

1:17:22.550 --> 1:17:25.031
-You've uncaged me.

1:17:26.903 --> 1:17:31.647
But your foul play
is no longer amusing to me.

1:17:33.997 --> 1:17:37.087
So, I think
I'll exterminate you.

1:17:40.917 --> 1:17:43.223
And your entire...

1:17:43.267 --> 1:17:45.138
family!

1:17:49.316 --> 1:17:52.493
Get ready to cry uncle!

1:17:57.673 --> 1:17:58.848
Ahh!

1:18:07.639 --> 1:18:09.859
-

1:18:11.251 --> 1:18:13.253
Incoming!

1:18:16.213 --> 1:18:17.475
Ophelia!

1:18:24.438 --> 1:18:26.310
-

1:18:35.928 --> 1:18:37.451
Oh, yeah!

1:18:37.495 --> 1:18:38.714
That's it! You got him!

1:18:44.720 --> 1:18:46.112
No!

1:18:48.549 --> 1:18:49.725
Get him, Fester!

1:18:49.768 --> 1:18:51.204
Ink him! Ink him, baby!

1:19:00.257 --> 1:19:02.346
Everybody, run!

1:19:28.285 --> 1:19:30.287
Madison, would you
do me the honor...

1:19:38.643 --> 1:19:41.472
Yes, I'll marry you.

1:19:44.910 --> 1:19:46.651
Uncle Fester.

1:19:47.826 --> 1:19:49.872
He's dying.

1:19:49.915 --> 1:19:52.091
And it's all my fault.

1:19:52.135 --> 1:19:54.006
Oh, Wednesday.

1:20:02.667 --> 1:20:04.669
Mother, when you said
this necklace

1:20:04.712 --> 1:20:06.627
was a part of every Addams,

1:20:06.671 --> 1:20:08.542
what did you mean?

1:20:08.586 --> 1:20:12.329
It contains a drop of blood
from every Addams
born into the family.

1:20:12.372 --> 1:20:15.419
Your father, Pugsley, you...

1:20:16.028 --> 1:20:18.465
And Uncle Fester.

1:20:18.509 --> 1:20:21.120
Your little Addams
DNA cocktail here

1:20:21.164 --> 1:20:22.469
might just save the day.

1:20:22.948 --> 1:20:24.036
Lurch!

1:20:49.714 --> 1:20:51.237
Bottoms up, Uncle Fester.

1:21:03.989 --> 1:21:05.077
Whoa!

1:21:32.409 --> 1:21:34.977
Did I win?

1:21:35.281 --> 1:21:37.153
Yes.

1:21:37.196 --> 1:21:40.460
-Yes, you did, Uncle Fester.
-

1:21:40.504 --> 1:21:42.114
Oh, and, Pugsley,

1:21:42.158 --> 1:21:44.377
it looks like Ophelia
is feeling better too.

1:21:53.430 --> 1:21:56.650
Mother, Father, I'm sorry.

1:21:56.694 --> 1:21:59.349
I didn't want to be an Addams.

1:21:59.392 --> 1:22:02.352
I struggled
with feeling different.

1:22:02.395 --> 1:22:05.790
But now,
I realize that being different

1:22:05.833 --> 1:22:09.054
is the most
Addams-y thing there is.

1:22:09.098 --> 1:22:11.143
"Different"
is what the extra "D"

1:22:11.187 --> 1:22:13.189
in "Addams" stands for.

1:22:13.232 --> 1:22:16.192
I always thought
it stood for "dismemberment."

1:22:17.019 --> 1:22:18.585
Can you forgive me?

1:22:19.325 --> 1:22:20.805
Wednesday,

1:22:20.848 --> 1:22:24.809
you are and always
will be our little ghoul.

1:22:24.852 --> 1:22:26.724
We love you.

1:22:26.767 --> 1:22:27.986
Thank you, Mother.

1:22:28.030 --> 1:22:29.422
The feeling is mutual.

1:22:30.641 --> 1:22:32.034
And, Father...

1:22:32.077 --> 1:22:34.732
Yes, my little raven?

1:22:34.775 --> 1:22:36.603
I have something for you.

1:22:46.091 --> 1:22:49.399
Come on, Addams family.
Let's go home.

1:22:49.442 --> 1:22:50.661
-

1:23:00.410 --> 1:23:01.541
Gruesome.

1:23:01.585 --> 1:23:04.936
Mmm! And fragrant.

1:23:04.980 --> 1:23:06.677
-

1:23:08.244 --> 1:23:09.854
-Yeah! Awesome!

1:23:09.897 --> 1:23:11.029
Now, look, look, look.

1:23:11.073 --> 1:23:13.597
All I did was invite
a few people over

1:23:13.640 --> 1:23:15.599
and things got
a little bit out of hand.

1:23:15.642 --> 1:23:18.515
Yes,
there were a few injuries,
but the EMT is here.

1:23:18.558 --> 1:23:20.821
They're having
a wonderful time.

1:23:20.865 --> 1:23:23.650
What a lovely
homecoming present.

1:23:35.532 --> 1:23:38.274
I thought
you'd never get here.

1:23:45.542 --> 1:23:48.197
Let's light it up, hairball!

1:23:51.374 --> 1:23:52.766
I brought it back

1:23:52.810 --> 1:23:54.942
Is where the party at

1:23:54.986 --> 1:23:56.770
These people out they seat

1:23:56.814 --> 1:23:58.642
To clap your hands

1:23:58.685 --> 1:24:00.078
And have a good time

1:24:01.906 --> 1:24:03.212
In the back

1:24:06.258 --> 1:24:07.912
The party started

1:24:07.955 --> 1:24:10.219
Gloves and mitt, club is lit

1:24:10.262 --> 1:24:11.872
One of a kind

1:24:14.701 --> 1:24:17.313
To the wild, wild West Coast

1:24:17.356 --> 1:24:18.488
Feeling like a villain

1:24:20.229 --> 1:24:22.013
And he's a playa, playa

1:24:22.057 --> 1:24:23.014
In the house

1:24:24.581 --> 1:24:26.452
In case you didn't know

1:24:27.627 --> 1:24:29.977
We love you, It!

1:24:30.021 --> 1:24:32.719
I still don't understand
a word that guy says.

1:24:35.418 --> 1:24:37.202
Yeah!

1:24:37.246 --> 1:24:40.988
Didn't I tell you this trip
would bring the family
closer together?

1:24:41.032 --> 1:24:43.948
You're a wonderful father,
darling.

1:24:43.991 --> 1:24:46.385
There's one thing
that's still troubling me.

1:24:46.429 --> 1:24:48.561
Cyrus lied
about being my father,

1:24:48.605 --> 1:24:51.738
but when I tested your hair
at the Grand Canyon,

1:24:51.782 --> 1:24:55.742
it said conclusively that you
were not my father either.

1:24:55.786 --> 1:24:58.484
Ah, that explains it.

1:24:58.528 --> 1:24:59.964
I suffered a little accident

1:25:00.007 --> 1:25:02.227
with a napalm experiment
a few years back

1:25:02.271 --> 1:25:04.751
and lost my beautiful,
beautiful hair.

1:25:07.363 --> 1:25:09.713
Had it replaced
with real Sasquatch fur.

1:25:09.756 --> 1:25:11.541
I assure you, Wednesday,

1:25:11.584 --> 1:25:13.064
I am your father.

1:25:13.108 --> 1:25:15.240
Now and always.

1:25:17.286 --> 1:25:19.462
I already hugged you once,
Father.

1:25:19.505 --> 1:25:21.855
That's quite enough affection
for a lifetime.

1:25:24.336 --> 1:25:26.338
Well, Addams,

1:25:26.382 --> 1:25:29.080
time to start planning
the next family vacation.

1:25:29.124 --> 1:25:32.736
Maybe a trip around the world?
What do you say?

1:26:15.170 --> 1:26:18.303
playing]

1:26:18.347 --> 1:26:20.827
In that creepy, crawly

1:26:22.394 --> 1:26:24.701
But it's looking like a body

1:26:24.744 --> 1:26:26.920
Crazy but I'm confident

1:26:26.964 --> 1:26:29.140
To any name they hit me with

1:26:29.184 --> 1:26:31.534
I think I'm all that

1:26:31.577 --> 1:26:33.666
They don't know how
To pronounce that

1:26:33.710 --> 1:26:35.886
'Cause I bounce back

1:26:35.929 --> 1:26:37.844
My clique like a mousepad

1:26:47.202 --> 1:26:51.858
All down your street

1:26:51.902 --> 1:26:56.820
I'm sayin' they're with me

1:26:56.863 --> 1:26:58.952

1:27:01.346 --> 1:27:05.829
Cha cha cha

1:27:25.152 --> 1:27:27.720
'Cause nobody can handle me

1:27:29.113 --> 1:27:30.767
They never seen

1:27:30.810 --> 1:27:32.508
I'm in love with myself

1:27:32.551 --> 1:27:33.509
That they can't touch me

1:27:35.598 --> 1:27:40.167
All down your street

1:27:40.211 --> 1:27:42.561
