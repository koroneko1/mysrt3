WEBVTT

01:02.854 --> 01:04.313
Let's go!

01:08.985 --> 01:10.819
- I'm open, I'm open.
- I don't see it!

01:10.904 --> 01:13.238
- Take your time!
- Run!

01:13.323 --> 01:15.407
- Run!
- Go, go!

01:15.492 --> 01:18.494
- Let's go!
- Defence! Defence!

01:18.578 --> 01:19.703
Come on, man!

01:19.788 --> 01:22.164
- Hustle, hustle!
- Control that ball!

01:22.248 --> 01:24.708
- Bolton! I'm open!
- Set it up! Let's go!

01:24.793 --> 01:27.294
All right, let's go!
Let's move! Let's move!

01:27.337 --> 01:30.172
- Watch the run in.
- Watch the back door!

01:30.298 --> 01:31.507
Get it!

01:33.468 --> 01:35.385
That concludes the first half of play

01:35.553 --> 01:38.180
in our final game,
with the West High Knights

01:38.348 --> 01:42.309
leading defending champion
East High Wildcats 47-26.

01:42.352 --> 01:44.394
Sixteen minutes remain in the game.

02:06.543 --> 02:09.586
All right! No more X's and O's. OK?

02:09.670 --> 02:13.590
Forget about the scoreboard
because here's a number that matters.

02:13.675 --> 02:14.716
Sixteen.

02:14.801 --> 02:18.554
There's 16 minutes
left in this game, guys.

02:18.596 --> 02:21.849
There's only 16 minutes
left in the season.

02:21.891 --> 02:25.519
And for the seniors
on this squad... guys...

02:28.481 --> 02:31.567
...you've only got 16 minutes
left in a Wildcat uniform.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.028
So make them count.

02:36.906 --> 02:39.950
Sixteen minutes to be a team.

02:43.580 --> 02:44.621
Captains!

02:48.418 --> 02:49.585
All right.

02:50.753 --> 02:52.087
Hey, guys.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.716
Now, you heard Coach.

02:55.758 --> 02:58.218
We're all gonna remember
the next 16 minutes

02:58.386 --> 03:00.554
for a long time
after we leave East High.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.432
So it's now or never.

03:05.685 --> 03:06.768
Chad.

03:09.772 --> 03:15.777
- What team?
- Wildcats!

03:20.241 --> 03:23.994
Sixteen, 16, 16 minutes left
Better get it done

03:24.162 --> 03:28.582
Sixteen, 16, 16 more minutes
Get ready, game on!

03:28.625 --> 03:32.961
Sixteen, 16, 16 minutes left
Running out of time

03:33.046 --> 03:36.757
Sixteen, 16, 16 more minutes
And it's on the line

03:36.925 --> 03:40.969
Sixteen, 16, 16 minutes left
Got to get it done

03:41.137 --> 03:44.806
Sixteen, 16, 16 more minutes
till we're number one!

03:44.849 --> 03:48.143
W-I-L-D Wildcats!

03:48.186 --> 03:49.686
Huddle up! Let's go!

03:49.854 --> 03:53.649
W-I-L-D Wildcats!
Come on, come on

03:54.525 --> 03:55.734
Ready?

03:56.694 --> 03:57.819
Break!

03:57.862 --> 04:01.365
W-I-L-D Wildcats!
Now's the time

04:02.408 --> 04:05.953
Got to get it inside, down low
In the paint, now shoot

04:05.995 --> 04:06.995
Score!

04:07.080 --> 04:08.997
- Gotta work together
- Defence!

04:09.165 --> 04:10.332
Give me the ball

04:10.375 --> 04:13.502
Fast break, keep the ball in control
Let it fly from downtown

04:13.670 --> 04:14.836
Three more

04:15.004 --> 04:17.172
- Show them we can do better
- No way!

04:17.673 --> 04:19.007
Come on, boys!

04:19.175 --> 04:23.428
The way we play tonight
is what we leave behind

04:23.513 --> 04:27.349
It all comes down to right now
It's up to us

04:27.392 --> 04:30.185
- Let's go!
- So what are we gonna be

04:30.270 --> 04:31.853
T-E-A-M
Team!

04:31.938 --> 04:35.190
Gotta work it out, turn it on

04:35.233 --> 04:37.317
This is the last time to get it right

04:37.360 --> 04:39.695
This is the last chance
to make it our night

04:39.737 --> 04:41.655
We got to show what we're all about

04:41.823 --> 04:43.365
- Work together
- Time out!

04:43.533 --> 04:47.703
This is the last chance to make our mark
History will know who we are

04:47.787 --> 04:52.040
This is the last game so make it count
It's now or never

04:54.919 --> 04:57.254
- Hey! That's a foul!
- Oh, dear.

04:59.716 --> 05:00.757
You OK?

05:01.801 --> 05:02.884
Come on, Troy!

05:05.388 --> 05:07.389
Let's go, buddy!

05:08.766 --> 05:11.435
Troy

05:11.519 --> 05:14.688
Right now I can hardly breathe

05:14.731 --> 05:19.568
You can do it, just know that I believe

05:19.610 --> 05:22.571
And that's all I really need

05:22.655 --> 05:24.698
- Then come on
- Make me strong

05:24.741 --> 05:27.617
It's time to turn it up
Game on!

05:27.702 --> 05:31.288
Wildcats gonna tear it up
Go, Wildcats, yeah, we're number one

05:31.372 --> 05:33.665
Hey, Wildcats, we're champions

05:33.750 --> 05:36.626
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Game on

05:36.711 --> 05:38.420
Foul!

05:38.463 --> 05:40.047
- Yeah!
- All right!

05:40.089 --> 05:41.757
- What?
- Yeah!

05:41.841 --> 05:43.967
Let me hear you say
Hey, hey, hey, yeah

05:47.597 --> 05:50.098
I'm tripled-teamed.
I can't get a shot off.

05:50.141 --> 05:53.060
- What do you want to do?
- Let's put in Rocket Man.

05:53.102 --> 05:54.728
Rocket Man?

05:54.771 --> 05:57.272
- Troy, you're two points away from...
- I know.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.108
- Just get me the ball.
- OK.

06:00.151 --> 06:02.944
Rocket Man! Come on!
Come on, Rocket Man! You're in!

06:02.987 --> 06:04.029
- Get in here!
- Go!

06:04.113 --> 06:05.113
- Let's go!
- Move!

06:05.156 --> 06:06.615
Go, go, go! Move!

06:07.241 --> 06:08.992
Yeah! Oh, yeah!

06:09.118 --> 06:13.455
Calm down, OK?
All right, keep your eyes on me.

06:13.498 --> 06:16.166
- Game on!
- This is the last time to get it right

06:16.250 --> 06:18.418
This is the last chance
to make it our night

06:18.586 --> 06:22.464
We gotta show what we're all about
Team! Work together

06:22.507 --> 06:26.968
This is the last chance to make our mark
History will know who we are

06:27.053 --> 06:30.472
This is the last game so make it count
It's now or never

06:32.058 --> 06:33.058
Come on!

06:37.105 --> 06:38.146
Shoot it!

06:45.196 --> 06:46.196
Yes!

06:47.573 --> 06:50.409
We won, dude! We won! You OK?

07:00.837 --> 07:03.004
That's what I'm talking about. Yeah!

07:09.470 --> 07:10.470
I'm pushing.

07:10.638 --> 07:12.556
- You better be.
- I'm pushing!

07:12.640 --> 07:14.975
- Push harder!
- Chad, tree!

07:19.897 --> 07:21.106
Home sweet home.

07:23.526 --> 07:26.695
- I'm saving for a new fuel pump.
- Save faster.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.872
Hey, turn it up, Kels.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.250
- How you doing, girl?
- I'm good!

07:40.334 --> 07:41.751
- Great comeback!
- Thanks.

07:41.836 --> 07:44.296
- Watch that tail. It's dangerous.
- You know it!

07:44.380 --> 07:47.799
- Amazing! We won!
- I didn't think they'd come back.

07:47.884 --> 07:48.884
Hey!

07:48.926 --> 07:51.678
- Congratulations!
- Thanks. Can I fix you a plate?

07:51.721 --> 07:54.389
- I want one of everything!
- Are we celebrating?

07:54.432 --> 07:55.640
What's up, Hoops?

07:55.725 --> 07:58.059
- Back-to-back champions!
- Yeah, thanks.

07:58.102 --> 08:00.479
Coach, got a couple
of empty lockers at U of A?

08:00.563 --> 08:01.771
Hopefully not for long.

08:01.856 --> 08:04.191
Charlie Danforth
will suit up next season.

08:04.233 --> 08:05.775
Front row seat will be fine.

08:05.860 --> 08:09.821
That teamwork I saw tonight, that
assist where you gave up the final shot,

08:09.906 --> 08:12.240
that's the kind of players
I'm looking for.

08:12.283 --> 08:14.784
We're going to see you
in Redhawk uniforms?

08:14.869 --> 08:16.661
- Done deal.
- Amen to that.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.371
- Go have some fun.
- OK.

08:18.414 --> 08:20.874
- Congratulations, Troy!
- Hey! Thanks.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.000
- Yo!
- Hey, dude!

08:22.084 --> 08:23.335
Sweet game!

08:23.419 --> 08:27.172
Hey, Troy. Great house, bro.
Your room is way cool.

08:27.256 --> 08:29.758
Thanks, man. You were in my room?

08:29.842 --> 08:32.844
Well, yeah. I just took a picture. Look.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.554
- I'm doing mine the same way.
- Great.

08:35.597 --> 08:38.975
We should hang out tonight.
Get to know each other or something.

08:39.059 --> 08:42.479
I just gotta grab the championship
trophy I left it in my truck.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.397
- Don't sweat it! I'm on it!
- OK.

08:47.652 --> 08:48.652
Hi!

08:59.455 --> 09:02.624
So, another top-secret hiding place?

09:03.793 --> 09:05.877
You're the second girl
I've had up here.

09:08.506 --> 09:10.423
The first was my mom.

09:10.466 --> 09:12.467
She only climbed up here to get me down.

09:14.095 --> 09:17.681
Well, I'm honoured.
This place is so cool.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.642
Me and my dad built it.

09:23.479 --> 09:25.522
Is that the coach
from U of A down there?

09:25.606 --> 09:29.150
- Yeah. He's at my house.
- Yeah.

09:29.235 --> 09:30.735
Crazy.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.071
I bet he's already got
your name on a locker.

09:34.490 --> 09:39.077
It's always been my dad's dream. Now
I'm going to end up at his alma mater.

09:41.872 --> 09:43.206
Did I just say that?

09:46.127 --> 09:50.380
My mom and I have been talking about
Stanford pretty much since I was born.

09:50.464 --> 09:53.800
And you're already in. That's so cool.

09:56.178 --> 09:59.723
Except she won't stop talking about it.
It's embarrassing.

09:59.807 --> 10:02.017
Come on. She's proud of you.

10:04.186 --> 10:05.520
I'm proud of you.

10:07.857 --> 10:10.817
The thing about Stanford
is it's a thousand and fifty...

10:10.860 --> 10:12.861
...fifty-three miles from here.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.281
I know.

10:20.703 --> 10:24.247
It suddenly seems like the rest
of the school year is coming so fast.

10:24.332 --> 10:27.208
Yeah. I wish it would all just stop.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.546
At least just slow down.

10:41.057 --> 10:45.060
Can you imagine
what would happen

10:45.227 --> 10:47.896
If we could have any dream?

10:49.607 --> 10:53.735
I'd wish this moment
was ours to own it

10:53.778 --> 10:56.321
And that it would never leave

10:57.365 --> 11:00.241
Then I would thank that star

11:00.326 --> 11:03.411
That made our wish come true

11:03.579 --> 11:05.914
Oh, yeah

11:05.956 --> 11:09.334
'Cause he knows that where you are

11:09.418 --> 11:13.338
Is where I should be too

11:16.008 --> 11:18.843
Right here

11:20.346 --> 11:23.598
Right now

11:23.641 --> 11:26.142
- Right now
- I'm looking at you

11:26.227 --> 11:28.937
And my heart loves the view

11:29.021 --> 11:33.400
- 'Cause you mean everything
- Everything

11:33.442 --> 11:36.611
Right here

11:36.654 --> 11:40.407
I promise you somehow

11:40.449 --> 11:42.283
Somehow we're gonna

11:42.368 --> 11:46.788
Tomorrow can wait
for some other day to be

11:46.831 --> 11:51.334
To be
But right now there's you and me

11:52.294 --> 11:55.171
Oh, we know it's coming

11:55.256 --> 11:57.340
And it's coming fast

11:57.425 --> 12:00.301
It's always you and me

12:00.970 --> 12:04.180
So let's make every second last

12:04.849 --> 12:08.643
Make it last

12:08.686 --> 12:11.271
'Cause right here

12:12.606 --> 12:15.650
Right now

12:16.652 --> 12:18.737
Yeah, I'm looking at you

12:18.821 --> 12:21.239
And my heart loves the view

12:21.323 --> 12:24.451
'Cause you mean everything

12:25.828 --> 12:28.830
Right here

12:28.914 --> 12:32.834
I promise you somehow

12:34.086 --> 12:36.171
That tomorrow can wait

12:36.213 --> 12:39.174
For some other day to be

12:39.258 --> 12:44.220
To be
But right now there's you and me

12:44.305 --> 12:47.766
- You and me
- You and me

12:47.850 --> 12:49.184
You and me

12:49.268 --> 12:50.810
But right now there's

12:50.853 --> 12:56.191
You and me

13:06.535 --> 13:09.204
Is this a pirate's wheel?

13:09.288 --> 13:10.288
No.

13:13.709 --> 13:15.043
Very cute.

13:15.127 --> 13:16.878
I haven't played
with Robo-Rob since third grade.

13:16.921 --> 13:20.048
- I'm Robo-Rob. I am...
- Don't break him. Don't break him.

13:23.594 --> 13:25.637
- That's Chad's.
- Sure it is.

13:28.390 --> 13:31.267
Now it's just like kindergarten.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.603
Troy? You have guests.

13:33.687 --> 13:37.732
Don't make me come up there
and get you again. Hi, Gabriella.

13:39.109 --> 13:41.611
We'll be right down, Mom.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.991
She really will come up here
if we don't go down.

13:47.076 --> 13:48.827
Oh, OK.

13:57.670 --> 14:02.423
Right there, right there. OK, come on
through. Come on. There you go.

14:27.950 --> 14:28.950
Wow.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.794
Hey, Troy.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.005
So, when's the big game?

14:43.173 --> 14:44.340
Yesterday.

14:46.260 --> 14:47.927
Oh, well. Good luck.

14:50.389 --> 14:52.515
- Wow.
- She's so sweet.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.962
What are you? I mean, who are you?

15:23.005 --> 15:26.382
Good morning, Ms. Evans.
I'm Tiara Gold.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.468
I transferred
to East High from London

15:28.510 --> 15:31.846
and I noticed on the board you're
in need of a personal assistant.

15:32.806 --> 15:34.807
Yeah, with finals, prom, graduation,

15:34.850 --> 15:37.977
I need someone tracking
my appointments and assignments.

15:38.020 --> 15:41.522
Most important, I need someone
to run lines for the musical.

15:41.607 --> 15:46.361
- That's a theatre term for...
- Learning your role. I understand.

15:46.403 --> 15:49.072
It's best to keep
science and math books together,

15:49.156 --> 15:51.658
since those are
first lessons of the day.

15:51.700 --> 15:53.576
How do you know my schedule?

15:53.661 --> 15:56.788
I took the liberty of checking,
simply to make certain

15:56.872 --> 16:01.084
I'd have your non-fat, no-foam,
soy latte ready for free period.

16:01.168 --> 16:03.461
- One packet of sweetener?
- Organic.

16:07.424 --> 16:11.719
I'll e-mail you my wardrobe choices each
morning so that our outfits won't clash.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.263
If you own any orange, get rid of it.

16:17.142 --> 16:19.602
By the way, like the accent.

16:19.687 --> 16:22.105
It's... sweet.

16:26.986 --> 16:30.947
Troy, my brother.
Can I have your gym locker?

16:31.949 --> 16:34.367
- What?
- Like starting next week.

16:34.410 --> 16:38.746
I'll be running the team next season
and it'll help me out with the guys.

16:38.789 --> 16:42.208
- Yeah, why didn't I think of that?
- I don't know.

16:43.752 --> 16:45.378
Tardy again. Later, bro!

16:45.421 --> 16:48.381
Are you serious?

16:48.424 --> 16:50.425
What about her... Hey.

16:53.262 --> 16:56.139
All right, everyone. Settle down.

16:56.223 --> 16:59.934
We are all still excited
about our Wildcats'

17:00.019 --> 17:04.021
- top-to-bottom championships.
- That would be "back-to-back".

17:04.106 --> 17:07.692
Whatever the case, it was a grand slam.
Well done!

17:07.776 --> 17:11.154
And our student body president
and co-editor of the yearbook,

17:11.238 --> 17:14.156
Taylor McKessie,
has important announcements.

17:14.241 --> 17:18.286
Senior trip committee meets tomorrow
and reports Thursday to prom committee,

17:18.328 --> 17:20.954
headed by Martha.
Pick up your tickets from her.

17:21.040 --> 17:24.459
This year's theme is "The Last Waltz".

17:24.626 --> 17:26.586
But don't be last to pick up tickets.

17:26.627 --> 17:30.590
Graduation committee convenes Monday.
Picture deadline is Thursday

17:30.632 --> 17:34.302
and finals study groups alternate
with all of the above. Questions?

17:34.344 --> 17:36.804
What's the lunch special
in the cafeteria?

17:38.140 --> 17:40.892
New York deli. Anyone else?

17:41.477 --> 17:47.023
Moving on. Ms. Sharpay Evans,
four-term president of the drama club,

17:47.107 --> 17:48.816
spring musicale report.

17:48.901 --> 17:52.195
Well, with prom, finals,
everyone is so busy.

17:52.279 --> 17:55.323
I was thinking
I'd select something modest.

17:55.365 --> 17:57.658
Perhaps even a one-woman show.

18:00.954 --> 18:03.873
A little light on the sign-ups, Kelsi?

18:03.957 --> 18:07.043
No. We're actually doing pretty well.

18:08.754 --> 18:12.381
Well, well, well.
Almost the entire homeroom.

18:14.176 --> 18:16.052
How inspiring!

18:16.136 --> 18:20.556
I will happily see all of you
at free period to discuss the show

18:20.641 --> 18:24.477
and to make
a very special announcement.

18:39.827 --> 18:43.704
I'll be retaking my finals two or three
times. I'm moving into the library.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.623
I'm working on my truck every day.

18:45.707 --> 18:48.209
I've got five recipes
for Family Science final.

18:48.252 --> 18:50.211
We've got a yearbook to edit, so no.

18:50.295 --> 18:54.382
Sorry! Jeez. I thought since it was the
last show, everyone would want to do it.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.884
- You're wrong.
- We just don't have time.

18:57.886 --> 19:02.390
Hey. Hey, you guys, listen up.
Kelsi's right. We should do this.

19:02.474 --> 19:05.226
This is our last chance
to do something together.

19:05.310 --> 19:07.854
All of us. Something really fun.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.438
Oh, yippee.

19:10.524 --> 19:12.400
So, what do you say, Wildcats?

19:13.402 --> 19:15.403
No, I still don't think
it's a good idea.

19:15.487 --> 19:18.823
- Guys, come on! It's our senior year!
- Troy.

19:21.034 --> 19:24.579
We're all in this together.
This is our senior year.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.205
I'm in.

19:27.749 --> 19:28.958
What?

19:29.042 --> 19:30.793
- It will be fun.
- Yes!

19:31.128 --> 19:33.838
- Oh, boy.
- How much time will it take?

19:33.922 --> 19:36.257
Yeah. And what the heck
is the show about?

19:36.341 --> 19:37.967
You, Mr Danforth.

19:39.636 --> 19:40.636
Me?

19:43.265 --> 19:46.893
The spring musicale is all about you.

19:51.190 --> 19:54.901
Hold up. If it's about me,
then can I have my ball back? Please?

19:56.612 --> 19:58.863
- It's about all of you.
- Go!

19:58.947 --> 20:00.740
And all of you will create it.

20:00.782 --> 20:06.245
A show about your final days
at East High. We'll call it Senior Year

20:06.288 --> 20:07.580
Genius.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.292
Playing a role is easy,

20:11.335 --> 20:14.086
but being yourself,
now that's a challenge.

20:14.129 --> 20:15.630
Miss Darbus, exactly...

20:15.714 --> 20:18.424
Kelsi will compose,
Ryan will choreograph

20:18.467 --> 20:20.968
- and I will direct.
- Thank you.

20:21.053 --> 20:25.723
Now, I have
some very important news from...

20:27.226 --> 20:30.645
...the Juilliard School
in New York City,

20:30.729 --> 20:34.398
America's preeminent college
for the performing arts.

20:34.483 --> 20:38.027
And for the first time
in East High history,

20:38.111 --> 20:41.405
Juilliard is considering four of you

20:41.490 --> 20:44.200
for one available scholarship.

20:44.284 --> 20:47.203
- Miss Sharpay Evans.
- I'm already packed.

20:47.371 --> 20:50.414
- Mr Ryan Evans.
- Dance.

20:50.499 --> 20:53.709
- Miss Kelsi Nielsen.
- What? They got my letter?

20:53.794 --> 20:55.211
They certainly did.

20:55.379 --> 20:59.840
And, lastly, Mr Troy Bolton.

20:59.883 --> 21:01.801
What?

21:02.386 --> 21:07.014
Juilliard will be sending
representatives to observe our show.

21:09.184 --> 21:12.937
So good luck to our four applicants.

21:14.022 --> 21:17.316
Yeah, nice. Nice, guys.
That's pretty funny.

21:18.527 --> 21:21.195
So... who's the big comedian?

21:21.280 --> 21:25.366
- Is there something wrong?
- Yeah. Yeah, I didn't apply.

21:26.451 --> 21:30.997
- I've never heard of Juilliard.
- Well, that may be, Mr Bolton,

21:31.039 --> 21:34.000
but evidently Juilliard
has heard of you.

21:34.918 --> 21:38.713
And as you create this show,
you must dig deep

21:38.755 --> 21:43.175
and think about your aspirations
and dreams for the future.

21:43.218 --> 21:45.011
Line up, downstage, please.

21:48.557 --> 21:52.226
Let's begin with Mr Danforth.
Step forward, please.

21:53.478 --> 21:54.478
Your future.

21:55.272 --> 21:58.399
It's easy. It's U of A.
Hoops all the way.

21:58.483 --> 22:02.278
- Yeah.
- Miss McKessie.

22:02.362 --> 22:05.239
I'm going to be the President
of the United States.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.909
I'm going to finish
college first, of course.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.912
Martha Cox, you're late.

22:11.997 --> 22:15.333
I'm sorry, I just thought maybe
we could use a few more dancers.

22:21.798 --> 22:24.717
I feel a show coming on already!

22:32.934 --> 22:36.979
Mr Bolton.

22:37.898 --> 22:40.566
- Your future.
- Oh, yeah...

22:43.528 --> 22:44.862
You know...

22:47.449 --> 22:48.991
I've been thinking about...

22:55.707 --> 22:58.542
I think we should stage
the perfect prom.

22:59.294 --> 23:02.505
Golly gee, how adorable.
What do I want?

23:03.131 --> 23:06.008
Gosh, I wouldn't know where to begin.

23:07.135 --> 23:09.220
But I know where it ends.

23:09.304 --> 23:10.888
Centre stage.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.058
A single spotlight.

23:16.478 --> 23:19.980
A huge marquee that reads...

23:33.745 --> 23:35.496
New York deli platter, please.

23:35.580 --> 23:39.166
- How can you think about food?
- Maybe because it's lunch time?

23:39.209 --> 23:41.836
No pickles.
Throw that Big Apple parfait in.

23:41.878 --> 23:44.380
OK, this show is our last shot, Ryan.

23:47.008 --> 23:50.511
Sharpay's meal, please.
Thanks. That's great.

23:50.554 --> 23:53.556
Troy pretended
to know nothing about Juilliard.

23:53.640 --> 23:56.183
- Give me a break.
- He seemed surprised to me.

23:56.226 --> 23:59.186
The theatre fairy magically
sent in Troy's application?

23:59.896 --> 24:03.941
Performers can't fool me. They're
deceitful, ambitious and ruthless.

24:04.025 --> 24:06.819
- Aren't we performers?
- Exactly.

24:09.865 --> 24:12.700
Imagine having everything
we ever dreamed

24:12.868 --> 24:14.410
- Don't you want it?
- Maybe

24:14.578 --> 24:16.370
- Can't ya see it?
- Kinda

24:16.413 --> 24:19.373
Imagine first audition
after college I get the lead

24:19.416 --> 24:21.083
- A part for me?
- Well, of course

24:21.251 --> 24:22.543
- Yeah, right
- You gotta believe it

24:22.586 --> 24:23.711
Keep talking

24:23.753 --> 24:27.381
- You and I, all the fame
- Sharpay and what's-his-name

24:27.424 --> 24:28.507
- Sound exciting?
- Inviting

24:28.675 --> 24:30.134
- Let's do it then
- Listening

24:30.302 --> 24:33.137
Personal stylist, agent and a publicist

24:33.221 --> 24:36.348
- But where do I fit into this?
- With you, we can win

24:36.391 --> 24:38.684
- Win the part?
- Think bigger

24:38.852 --> 24:42.188
- Become superstars?
- That's better

24:42.355 --> 24:44.899
Don't you see that bigger is better

24:45.066 --> 24:46.692
And better is bigger

24:46.860 --> 24:49.403
A little bit it is never enough
No, no, no

24:49.571 --> 24:50.905
Don't you want it all

24:50.947 --> 24:53.449
You want it
You know that you want it

24:54.367 --> 24:56.243
The fame and the fortune and more

24:56.328 --> 24:57.453
You want it all

24:57.537 --> 25:00.331
You want it
You know that you want it

25:00.415 --> 25:03.083
You gotta have your star on the door

25:03.126 --> 25:04.960
You want the world, nothing less

25:05.045 --> 25:06.587
All the glam and the press

25:06.755 --> 25:08.881
Only giving you the best reviews

25:08.965 --> 25:10.925
- Say it!
- I want it all

25:11.009 --> 25:13.594
I want it, I want it, want it

25:13.678 --> 25:18.098
My name in lights at Carnegie Hall
I want it all

25:18.266 --> 25:19.892
- Can't you see it?
- Yeah

25:20.060 --> 25:21.727
They're gonna love me

25:21.895 --> 25:23.229
I mean us

25:24.189 --> 25:27.775
Red carpet, rose bouquets
Crowd waiting backstage

25:27.859 --> 25:30.694
I'm with her, don't stop me
I'm not the paparazzi

25:30.862 --> 25:33.948
Invitations
Standing ovations

25:33.990 --> 25:35.616
- Magazines
- Yes, please

25:35.784 --> 25:37.284
Gonna be celebrities

25:37.452 --> 25:40.496
Photographs, fan club
Give the people what they love

25:40.664 --> 25:42.289
- Now you're excited
- I like it

25:42.457 --> 25:44.166
- Let's do it then
- I love you!

25:44.251 --> 25:47.169
Times Square, jet setter
Sequels pay better

25:47.337 --> 25:50.047
New York today
Tomorrow the world

25:50.131 --> 25:52.716
- Sold out shows?
- Think bigger

25:52.884 --> 25:56.262
- And the Oscar goes to...
- That's better

25:56.429 --> 26:00.474
Don't ya see that bigger is better
and better is bigger

26:00.642 --> 26:03.477
A little bit is never enough
No, no, no

26:03.603 --> 26:07.356
I want it all
I want it, want it, want it

26:07.816 --> 26:10.109
The fame and the fortune and more

26:10.193 --> 26:14.196
I want it all
I want it, want it, want it

26:14.281 --> 26:17.324
I gotta have my star on the door

26:17.409 --> 26:20.869
I want the world, nothing less
All the glam and the press

26:20.954 --> 26:23.622
Only giving me the best reviews

26:23.665 --> 26:27.293
I want it all
I want it, want it, want it

26:27.335 --> 26:31.505
Radio City Music Hall
We want it all

26:31.590 --> 26:36.719
Here in the spotlight we shine
Look at who we are

26:38.179 --> 26:40.764
When Broadway knows your name

26:40.932 --> 26:46.520
- Get out of the way!
- You know that you're a star

26:48.356 --> 26:50.858
Oh, dance

26:54.738 --> 26:58.115
- Madison Square Garden!
- They love you.

26:58.199 --> 27:00.492
Thank you! Thank you all!

27:01.870 --> 27:03.203
It's Oprah calling.

27:03.705 --> 27:05.205
Again.

27:05.248 --> 27:07.082
She wants you on the show.

27:08.084 --> 27:09.960
They're going to get back to you.

27:10.045 --> 27:12.963
- You know how fast you were going?
- Officer Chad!

27:13.048 --> 27:16.300
Hey, it's Ms. Evans. How you doing?
Follow me.

27:17.093 --> 27:20.054
I want it, I-I-I want it, want it

27:20.096 --> 27:23.807
I want it, I want it
I-I-I want it all, yeah

27:23.892 --> 27:27.144
I want it, I-I-I want it, want it

27:27.228 --> 27:30.356
- I want it, I-I-I want it
- I want it all

27:30.440 --> 27:35.194
I gotta, ooh, I gotta
I want to, I have to, I want to

27:36.071 --> 27:40.449
I want it, I want it
I have to have it

27:40.533 --> 27:42.951
I want it, I have to

27:43.036 --> 27:47.122
- I want it all
- I want it, want it, want it

27:47.207 --> 27:50.751
- The fame and the fortune and more
- I want it all

27:50.919 --> 27:53.587
I want it, want it, want it

27:53.672 --> 27:56.465
I gotta have my star on the door

27:56.549 --> 27:59.802
I want the world, nothing less
All the glam and the press

27:59.969 --> 28:04.056
Only giving me the best reviews
I want it all

28:04.099 --> 28:07.267
Paris, London, Rome, Toronto

28:07.352 --> 28:10.604
L.A., Sydney, Buenos Aires

28:10.689 --> 28:13.232
Tokyo, Moscow, Bollywood

28:14.943 --> 28:16.276
New York City

28:18.947 --> 28:20.280
We want it...

28:20.323 --> 28:22.574
All

28:42.512 --> 28:43.846
It's ours, Ryan.

28:45.306 --> 28:49.476
Wait a minute. Miss D said
that there's only one scholarship.

28:49.519 --> 28:51.228
There's two of us.

28:51.312 --> 28:54.148
We're twins.
They're going to have to take us both.

28:54.232 --> 28:57.860
Listen, Kelsi always writes
her best songs for Troy and Gabriella.

28:57.944 --> 29:01.363
So you make certain
we get those songs.

29:01.448 --> 29:02.906
How?

29:02.991 --> 29:07.077
Polish her glasses, buy her
some ruby slippers, take her to prom.

29:07.162 --> 29:08.537
I don't know.

29:09.789 --> 29:10.789
Just do it.

29:21.009 --> 29:22.843
- Hey, Tay.
- Morning, Sunshine.

29:23.011 --> 29:25.679
- You going to rehearsals today?
- Do I have a choice?

29:25.847 --> 29:29.641
You got us into this. I don't
understand. You might not be here.

29:29.684 --> 29:32.644
Told anyone you're up for
Stanford's Freshman Honours?

29:32.687 --> 29:33.854
No.

29:33.897 --> 29:36.023
You're gonna hear from them any day.

29:37.192 --> 29:39.526
- Hello?
- Taylor, these things take time.

29:41.237 --> 29:43.906
- Hey.
- I need you right away.

29:43.990 --> 29:45.407
- What?
- Look up.

29:49.746 --> 29:50.996
I have to go.

29:51.039 --> 29:53.624
This has two weeks detention
written all over it.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.377
Have fun.

30:03.218 --> 30:05.302
I really need your help.

30:05.386 --> 30:07.721
Which one do you think I should wear?

30:07.764 --> 30:10.557
Because?

30:10.642 --> 30:15.145
Because you're going to have a pretty
dress, so I want to look right.

30:15.897 --> 30:20.526
I've never been asked to a prom, but
this almost sounds like an invitation.

30:20.568 --> 30:21.902
This one.

30:27.408 --> 30:31.036
I've never been to a dance,
much less a prom.

30:35.583 --> 30:38.418
But I was hoping these
might be a good start.

30:43.967 --> 30:46.093
Do you think we're going
to have to waltz?

30:47.178 --> 30:49.096
Because I have no idea how to do that.

30:50.098 --> 30:53.642
All I know is what my dad taught me
when I was a little girl.

30:53.726 --> 30:56.937
I'd stand on his toes, and he'd
waltz me around the living room.

30:58.481 --> 30:59.857
Come here. I'll show you.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.650
- What?
- Come here.

31:03.486 --> 31:04.903
We're on the roof.

31:14.956 --> 31:16.456
Come here. You'll love it.

31:21.129 --> 31:23.797
Take my hand

31:23.882 --> 31:25.674
Take a breath

31:25.758 --> 31:28.844
Pull me close

31:28.928 --> 31:31.513
And take one step

31:31.598 --> 31:34.558
Keep your eyes

31:34.642 --> 31:37.019
Locked on mine

31:37.103 --> 31:39.396
And let the music

31:39.480 --> 31:42.524
Be your guide

31:42.609 --> 31:47.029
- Won't you promise me
- Now won't you promise me

31:47.113 --> 31:49.823
- That you'll never forget
- We'll keep dancing

31:49.866 --> 31:53.702
- To keep dancing wherever we go next
- Wherever we go next

31:53.786 --> 31:56.371
It's like catching lightning

31:56.456 --> 31:58.749
The chances of finding

31:58.833 --> 32:02.711
Someone like you

32:04.339 --> 32:06.715
It's one in a million

32:06.799 --> 32:09.343
The chances of feeling

32:09.427 --> 32:14.014
The way we do

32:14.098 --> 32:19.686
And with every step together

32:19.729 --> 32:25.233
We just keep on getting better

32:25.318 --> 32:29.571
- So can I have this dance?
- Can I have this dance?

32:29.656 --> 32:33.700
Can I have this dance?

32:35.870 --> 32:38.830
No mountain's too high, and no

32:38.873 --> 32:41.208
Ocean's too wide

32:41.250 --> 32:46.254
'Cause together or not
our dance won't stop

32:46.339 --> 32:47.714
Let it rain...

32:47.799 --> 32:52.052
Let it pour
What we have is worth fighting for

32:52.136 --> 32:57.224
You know I believe
that we were meant to be

32:59.727 --> 33:05.190
It's like catching lightning
The chances of finding

33:05.233 --> 33:10.445
Someone like you

33:10.530 --> 33:15.450
It's one in a million
The chances of feeling

33:15.535 --> 33:19.913
The way we do

33:19.998 --> 33:25.127
And with every step together

33:25.211 --> 33:30.924
We just keep on getting better

33:31.050 --> 33:35.387
- So can I have this dance?
- Can I have this dance?

33:35.430 --> 33:38.932
Can I have this dance?

33:40.351 --> 33:45.689
- Can I have...
- This dance?

33:45.773 --> 33:50.861
Can I have this dance?

33:58.119 --> 34:01.204
- So is that a yes?
- In every language.

34:04.083 --> 34:05.083
Yes.

34:07.295 --> 34:08.712
Oh, come on!

34:16.971 --> 34:18.179
Where's our clothes?

34:20.141 --> 34:22.684
- Yo, Rocket Man.
- Oh, there they are.

34:22.768 --> 34:25.478
- Thought you wanted our lockers.
- It's moving day.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.022
Oh, sweet.

34:27.106 --> 34:29.107
- Good job.
- Thanks, man.

34:30.735 --> 34:32.777
Perfect timing, Bolton.

34:32.820 --> 34:35.781
We weren't just given these lockers.
We had to earn them.

34:35.947 --> 34:37.949
Right. Right. Thanks, man.

34:40.161 --> 34:42.661
- Chad, what's the combo?
- What's the combo?

34:42.830 --> 34:45.873
It's like he said. You got to earn them.

34:45.958 --> 34:47.793
What's that supposed to mean?

34:47.835 --> 34:50.378
Hey, guys! Come back.
What are you talking about?

34:50.545 --> 34:53.422
- Not cool, guys!
- Hey, Bolton! Danforth!

34:57.053 --> 34:58.595
Hey, stop playing games!

35:00.681 --> 35:02.766
This isn't funny, guys!

35:04.685 --> 35:06.311
Chad, up top.

35:06.354 --> 35:08.688
- I got it.
- Spike!

35:08.940 --> 35:11.274
- Let's go! Out!
- Give me my clothes!

35:11.359 --> 35:15.195
- This isn't funny, guys!
- Just give me my clothes, man!

35:15.238 --> 35:16.655
Look out. Coming through.

35:19.283 --> 35:22.536
Hey, those are new jeans!
I need those back!

35:24.789 --> 35:29.876
Arms, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

35:29.919 --> 35:32.129
You're really stressing me out.

35:32.213 --> 35:34.965
I need to breathe.
And I don't know what Ryan is doing.

35:35.133 --> 35:38.176
He's doing some kind
of yoga Fosse thing.

35:38.219 --> 35:41.200
Two, three, four...
What are you doing?

35:41.201 --> 35:42.765
...six, seven, eight.

35:42.815 --> 35:47.227
One, two, three, great,
five, six, seven...

35:47.270 --> 35:49.020
Troy, just give me my clothes!

35:52.984 --> 35:55.193
- Yearbook opportunity.
- Photo op.

35:56.821 --> 35:58.238
Smile!

36:06.581 --> 36:09.666
- Hi.
- Bold choice, gentlemen.

36:10.084 --> 36:14.087
We all must have the courage
to discover ourselves.

36:14.255 --> 36:16.339
However, at East High,

36:16.424 --> 36:20.177
we will discover ourselves
whilst clothed.

36:21.596 --> 36:24.764
But welcome to our drama club
and our spring musicale.

36:24.807 --> 36:26.600
Yeah, welcome.

36:29.020 --> 36:33.023
The stage crew can use
your help during detention...

36:33.107 --> 36:34.608
...painting sets.

36:35.401 --> 36:36.776
Throw a sheet over them.

36:37.820 --> 36:39.237
Ryan!

36:39.614 --> 36:42.616
OK. All right, guys,
let's go back up to the top.

36:42.783 --> 36:45.535
Jason, why don't you come
down here and help me out.

36:52.376 --> 36:53.710
Fuel pump...

36:54.170 --> 36:56.796
...work in progress.
If my truck falls apart

36:56.881 --> 36:59.716
because I'm spending my time onstage,
it's your fault.

37:01.636 --> 37:05.472
You think I'd be spending any time
at all up there if it wasn't for you?

37:06.265 --> 37:08.308
You know what? I do.

37:09.477 --> 37:11.603
- What?
- You're so good.

37:12.772 --> 37:16.066
I watch you in rehearsals. You love it.

37:16.150 --> 37:18.526
Why is that so hard for you to admit?

37:19.487 --> 37:20.987
It isn't, to you.

37:22.031 --> 37:27.244
But to my dad? To Chad?
Yeah, it's a little hard.

37:27.328 --> 37:28.912
It shouldn't be.

37:32.500 --> 37:35.293
They're happy as long
as we're all talking about U of A.

37:36.629 --> 37:40.840
You chose Stanford.
U of A was sort of chosen for me.

37:41.968 --> 37:45.011
I haven't talked
to anybody about this, but...

37:45.137 --> 37:47.889
...I've had offers from other colleges.

37:49.850 --> 37:53.186
- I'm really listening.
- I get it, Troy.

37:54.939 --> 37:57.107
I still have decisions to make, too.

37:58.401 --> 37:59.567
Like what?

38:00.611 --> 38:05.740
I thought I heard you. I was just making
some snacks inside. Are you guys hungry?

38:08.828 --> 38:13.748
- I interrupted something, didn't I?
- Just talking, Mom.

38:13.833 --> 38:16.960
- Homework.
- OK.

38:20.047 --> 38:23.508
Speaking about homework... come on.

38:23.551 --> 38:25.552
I was joking.

38:37.023 --> 38:39.899
Compliments of Zeke.
Be careful, they're still hot.

38:39.984 --> 38:42.444
He doesn't know they're gone.
Eat the evidence.

38:42.611 --> 38:45.739
Kissing up to the yearbook editors.
Very smart move.

38:45.781 --> 38:48.199
Chad's hoping
for two pages on himself.

38:48.242 --> 38:50.452
Maybe even a third page,
just for his hair.

38:51.412 --> 38:52.746
Hey, what's right is right.

38:54.081 --> 38:57.959
Hoops, by the way, could you take me
after school to check out that tuxedo?

38:59.837 --> 39:01.755
Tuxedo? For what?

39:02.757 --> 39:04.090
For prom.

39:04.133 --> 39:07.010
Honey, if that's
what you call an invitation,

39:07.094 --> 39:08.970
you'll be dancing with yourself.

39:20.066 --> 39:24.027
- Yo, yo, yo. It's lunchtime.
- Come on, people. Go!

39:31.619 --> 39:33.453
- You ready?
- Yeah.

39:34.038 --> 39:35.372
It's now or never, man.

39:37.333 --> 39:39.125
The Garden Club is rooting for you.

39:45.341 --> 39:49.636
- OK. I'm going in.
- Go get her.

39:52.306 --> 39:55.183
- Troy, I really just...
- No, we're doing this now.

39:55.267 --> 39:57.143
How long have you been up there?

39:57.311 --> 39:58.978
- Hair's great.
- Don't...

40:01.107 --> 40:02.607
I know. I heard that, too.

40:03.275 --> 40:04.818
- Yes, good.
- Yes. OK.

40:06.987 --> 40:10.031
- Your turn.
- So... Hey.

40:11.492 --> 40:15.078
I was kind of wondering if you'd...
maybe go with me.

40:15.913 --> 40:20.375
Oh, hey, Chad. They have Tuna Surprise
on the menu. It's good. Really good.

40:22.711 --> 40:24.170
Dude.

40:26.173 --> 40:28.007
Taylor.

40:28.134 --> 40:30.093
Hey, I'm asking you to prom.

40:30.177 --> 40:32.762
I'm sorry, I can't hear you
because it's so loud.

40:32.847 --> 40:34.389
- Did you hear something?
- No.

40:34.557 --> 40:38.643
- Neither did I.
- Excuse me. Excuse me, everybody.

40:38.686 --> 40:40.854
- What are you...?
- Yo!

40:43.774 --> 40:45.608
My friend has something to say.

41:00.458 --> 41:01.833
Taylor McKessie.

41:03.210 --> 41:06.296
Will you please be
my date to the senior prom?

41:17.391 --> 41:18.683
I'd be honoured.

41:26.609 --> 41:29.110
Dude, I need to go shoot
some hoops or something.

41:29.195 --> 41:30.195
You nailed it!

41:31.071 --> 41:32.739
Guess now it's official

41:34.241 --> 41:36.743
- Can't back out, can't back out
- No

41:36.785 --> 41:37.911
Gettin' ready

41:37.953 --> 41:42.415
For the night of nights
The night of nights, all right

41:42.500 --> 41:44.000
- Don't panic
- Panic

41:44.084 --> 41:47.253
Now do we have
to dress up for the prom

41:47.338 --> 41:50.256
Dude, I don't think we have the choice

41:50.341 --> 41:54.302
Yeah it's the night of all nights
Got to look just right

41:54.386 --> 41:57.430
Dressin' to impress the boys

41:57.515 --> 41:59.849
Do I want classic or vintage or plaid

42:00.017 --> 42:02.769
- Where's the mirror
- I think this tux is too baggy

42:02.937 --> 42:04.729
Too tight
It makes me look weird

42:04.772 --> 42:06.940
Should I go movie star glamorous

42:06.982 --> 42:08.233
Sassy or sweet

42:08.400 --> 42:11.945
Don't know, but no one better wear
the same dress as me

42:11.987 --> 42:15.782
- It's the night of our nightmares
- It's the night of our dreams

42:15.824 --> 42:17.951
It's too late to back out of it

42:18.953 --> 42:22.539
- Makeovers, massages
- Don't know what a corsage is

42:22.706 --> 42:24.832
Been waiting all our lives for this

42:25.000 --> 42:27.544
- It's gonna be a night
- Can't wait

42:27.711 --> 42:29.295
- To remember
- Oh man

42:29.463 --> 42:31.798
Come on now
Big fun, all right

42:31.966 --> 42:34.592
- It's gonna be the night
- I guess

42:34.760 --> 42:37.136
- To last forever
- Lucky us

42:37.304 --> 42:39.347
We'll never ever ever forget

42:41.183 --> 42:42.684
- Gettin' ready
- Get ready

42:42.810 --> 42:44.602
- Get, gettin' ready
- Get ready

42:44.645 --> 42:45.812
Gettin' ready

42:45.896 --> 42:48.690
Get, gettin' ready
Go

42:48.774 --> 42:50.900
Hey, you've been in there an hour.

42:50.985 --> 42:54.487
So, what should I do with my hair

42:54.530 --> 42:56.239
- Where's my shaver
- I love it

42:56.323 --> 42:58.408
- I look like a waiter
- Should I fluff it

42:58.492 --> 43:00.910
It's getting later already
Should be there

43:04.081 --> 43:08.001
Her mother opens the door
I'm shakin' inside

43:08.043 --> 43:12.171
He's here, it's time
The hour's arrived

43:12.339 --> 43:15.508
Don't know why
her father's starin' me down

43:15.593 --> 43:19.220
Where's my purse, lip gloss?
Now I'm really freakin' out

43:20.222 --> 43:22.015
Then something changes my world

43:22.182 --> 43:25.560
The most beautiful girl
Right in front of my eyes

43:25.728 --> 43:28.062
- It's gonna be a night
- Oh yeah

43:28.230 --> 43:30.106
- To remember
- That's for sure

43:30.274 --> 43:32.650
Come on now
Big fun, all right

43:32.818 --> 43:35.278
- It's gonna be the night
- Here tonight

43:35.446 --> 43:37.488
- To last forever
- Forever more

43:37.656 --> 43:39.824
We'll never ever ever forget

43:52.671 --> 43:54.922
Guys, right here. Guys!

43:55.007 --> 43:58.384
Who's that girl?
She's so fine

43:58.469 --> 44:01.638
Who's that guy?
I don't recognise

44:01.722 --> 44:05.725
Who's that girl?
She looks so good, yeah

44:05.768 --> 44:09.228
Guess you never really noticed
But you probably should

44:09.271 --> 44:10.938
Big fun

44:11.065 --> 44:13.066
- On the night of nights
- All right

44:13.192 --> 44:15.234
The night of nights
Tonight

44:16.278 --> 44:18.154
Let's dance

44:18.238 --> 44:22.408
On the night of nights
You know we're gonna do it right

44:22.576 --> 44:26.329
It's gonna be a night
To remember

44:29.541 --> 44:33.211
It's gonna be the night
To last forever

44:36.757 --> 44:40.760
It's gonna be our night
To remember

44:43.806 --> 44:48.101
It's gonna be the night
To last forever

44:50.938 --> 44:53.606
It's gonna be our night
You know it

44:53.774 --> 44:55.441
To remember
For all time

44:55.609 --> 44:58.027
Come on now
Big fun

44:58.112 --> 45:00.655
It's gonna be the night
We love it

45:00.739 --> 45:03.032
To last forever
The rest of our lives

45:03.200 --> 45:05.201
We'll never ever ever forget

45:05.369 --> 45:08.246
It's gonna be our night
Oh yeah

45:08.288 --> 45:09.872
All together
Say it loud

45:10.040 --> 45:12.208
Come on now
Everyone, that's right

45:12.376 --> 45:14.961
It's gonna be the night
Yeah, the night

45:15.129 --> 45:17.004
To remember
Hear the crowd

45:17.172 --> 45:18.464
And never ever ever

45:18.590 --> 45:21.426
Never ever ever never ever

45:21.468 --> 45:23.428
Never never forget

45:25.264 --> 45:29.225
Bravo! Brava! Lights, please!

45:30.978 --> 45:33.646
Kelsi, splendid music.

45:33.814 --> 45:37.692
Ryan, your choreography
is quite inventive.

45:37.860 --> 45:39.819
- Thank you.
- And, Jason,

45:39.903 --> 45:41.738
we do not chew gum
in theatre or prom.

45:41.905 --> 45:44.824
See me at detention.
Lighting crew needs help.

45:44.867 --> 45:46.868
Excellent work, everyone.

45:46.952 --> 45:50.163
Costumes on the rack.
I will see you all tomorrow.

45:52.249 --> 45:55.334
Kelsi's writing something
amazing for Troy and Gabriella.

45:56.170 --> 45:57.503
A song, most likely.

45:58.881 --> 46:01.048
- Just find out what it is.
- OK.

46:02.926 --> 46:07.388
Hi, Boi! How was I? Thank you!

46:09.850 --> 46:12.935
- Hey Troy, good job, man.
- Dude, stop doing that!

46:13.854 --> 46:15.688
I'm sorry.

46:15.773 --> 46:17.940
Look, there's Sharpay.

46:18.025 --> 46:21.527
Now, you didn't hear this from me,
but she has a secret crush on you.

46:21.695 --> 46:23.196
A secret crush on me?

46:25.908 --> 46:28.075
- Should I talk to her?
- Yeah.

46:28.243 --> 46:29.952
OK. All right.

46:30.037 --> 46:31.746
Mr Zara.

46:31.830 --> 46:35.249
Yo! You can call me
"Rocket Man" if you want to.

46:35.417 --> 46:36.667
How generous.

46:36.710 --> 46:40.588
Mr Zara, since you have become
such a dedicated presence,

46:40.672 --> 46:43.674
I'm making you an understudy.
Miss Gold!

46:45.636 --> 46:49.430
- You as well.
- Nice.

46:49.515 --> 46:51.140
I'm in!

46:51.225 --> 46:53.559
I'm playing "The Understudy".

46:53.602 --> 46:55.353
- Congrats.
- Right. What's up?

46:55.395 --> 46:57.396
"Understudy" isn't a role, you moron.

46:57.481 --> 47:00.316
You go on if one of the leads
can't make the performance.

47:00.400 --> 47:04.362
Well, I hate to break it to you, sister,
but you're one, too.

47:05.739 --> 47:08.074
The difference being
I can carry a tune.

47:09.159 --> 47:12.203
Listen, I wouldn't sing
with you if my hair was on fire

47:12.371 --> 47:14.831
and you were the last bucket
of water on Earth.

47:14.915 --> 47:17.083
I wouldn't sing with you
if I were starving

47:17.167 --> 47:20.086
and you were
the last pickle at the picnic.

47:20.128 --> 47:21.921
Want to go to lunch sometime?

47:25.092 --> 47:28.845
Gentlemen, start your engines.

47:28.929 --> 47:32.849
That's what I'm talking about, bro.
Yo, come check out these guitars.

47:36.562 --> 47:38.020
What is this?

47:44.152 --> 47:46.571
"Stanford's Honours Programme
cordially..."

47:46.613 --> 47:48.531
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my goodness!

47:48.615 --> 47:51.534
"You and 29 students
are invited for early orientation."

47:52.911 --> 47:56.289
Oh, my gosh, that's huge.
Your mom must be so proud.

47:56.373 --> 47:58.624
Taylor, you're the only one that knows.

47:58.667 --> 48:00.626
But you've already accepted, right?

48:00.711 --> 48:03.296
I'm throwing a going-away party.
This is huge!

48:03.338 --> 48:06.674
You can't get rid of me that easy.
We've got a yearbook to do.

48:06.758 --> 48:08.134
- Back to work.
- OK.

48:08.176 --> 48:11.846
- These are Sharpay's yearbook photos.
- Of course they are. Thank you.

48:24.318 --> 48:27.236
- This better be good.
- They select only 30 freshmen

48:27.321 --> 48:32.283
from the entire incoming class. It's
a special three-weeks Honour programme.

48:32.326 --> 48:33.993
How prestigious.

48:35.996 --> 48:40.583
But the programme starts in two weeks.
She'd miss our sh... your show.

48:40.667 --> 48:43.753
Oh, my goodness. What to do?

48:45.172 --> 48:48.633
The show must go on, mustn't it?

49:24.836 --> 49:26.379
- Morning.
- Morning.

49:31.093 --> 49:32.760
"I just wanna be with you."

49:50.904 --> 49:54.657
I got a lot of things I have to do

49:55.993 --> 49:58.327
All these distractions

49:58.412 --> 50:00.997
Our future's coming soon

50:01.081 --> 50:02.915
We're being pulled

50:02.958 --> 50:06.377
A hundred different directions

50:06.420 --> 50:08.087
But whatever happens

50:08.130 --> 50:10.423
I know I've got you

50:11.967 --> 50:14.093
- It's beautiful.
- Thanks.

50:14.177 --> 50:17.096
I mean, really.
This, the prom number, everything.

50:17.180 --> 50:19.473
It's going to be a great show.

50:21.059 --> 50:25.062
- Speaking of prom, what are you doing?
- It's two days before the show.

50:25.105 --> 50:29.316
I'm writing orchestrations and fixing
charts. I still have to write lyrics.

50:29.401 --> 50:31.235
Great. I'll pick you up at 8.00.

50:32.112 --> 50:34.822
You're on my mind
You're in my heart

50:34.990 --> 50:36.907
It doesn't matter where we are

50:37.075 --> 50:39.118
We'll be all right

50:39.286 --> 50:43.122
Even if we're miles apart

50:43.790 --> 50:46.751
All I wanna do

50:47.836 --> 50:50.463
Is be with you

50:50.547 --> 50:52.965
Be with you

50:53.133 --> 50:56.385
There's nothing we can't do

50:56.553 --> 51:01.265
Just wanna be with you, only you

51:01.433 --> 51:04.518
No matter where life takes us

51:04.686 --> 51:09.690
- Nothing can break us apart
- You know it's true

51:09.858 --> 51:12.651
I just wanna be with you

51:14.863 --> 51:16.697
- Great!
- Awesome.

51:17.866 --> 51:19.909
Just be with you

51:22.162 --> 51:25.998
You know how life can be
It changes overnight

51:26.083 --> 51:30.503
It's sunny then raining
but it's all right

51:31.338 --> 51:36.050
- A friend like you
- Always makes it easy

51:36.134 --> 51:40.429
- I know that you get me
- Every time

51:40.597 --> 51:45.684
Through every up through every down
You know I'll always be around

51:45.852 --> 51:51.107
Through anything you can count on me

51:52.067 --> 51:54.819
All I wanna do

51:56.154 --> 51:58.697
Is be with you

51:58.865 --> 52:00.825
Be with you

52:01.493 --> 52:05.037
There's nothing we can't do

52:05.205 --> 52:09.375
Just wanna be with you, only you

52:09.751 --> 52:12.878
No matter where life takes us

52:13.046 --> 52:16.298
Nothing can break us apart

52:16.466 --> 52:17.883
You know it's true

52:18.051 --> 52:28.102
I just wanna be with you

52:33.233 --> 52:36.902
Bravo! Great rehearsal.
Pity the actor that has to follow you.

52:36.945 --> 52:39.530
I believe that actor is you,
Mr Choreographer.

52:40.574 --> 52:41.574
Oh, really?

52:41.616 --> 52:44.869
- OK, let's take five and run it again.
- Yes!

52:45.036 --> 52:48.455
- Ryan!
- That's five, everybody.

52:51.543 --> 52:53.627
Did you get a copy
of that song from Kelsi?

52:53.920 --> 52:57.131
No. But I'm taking her to prom.

52:58.258 --> 53:02.678
Brilliant. Keep your friends close,
and your enemies closer.

53:03.388 --> 53:04.763
Now get me that duet.

53:06.183 --> 53:08.893
Sharpay, you are not Gabriella.

53:10.729 --> 53:12.104
Don't be so sure.

53:19.905 --> 53:22.990
- Hey, Bobby.
- Hey, the boys are back.

53:23.074 --> 53:24.658
- Hey, Bob.
- How are you?

53:35.253 --> 53:36.795
- Mr Riley.
- Troy.

53:37.589 --> 53:41.300
There is nothing like the purr of
a well-tuned engine. That wasn't it.

53:41.343 --> 53:45.638
Yeah. My fuel pump's deceased.
You have a radiator cap for me?

53:45.722 --> 53:48.474
- Heard of duct tape?
- That's what I got on it now.

53:48.558 --> 53:51.518
Dig around over there.
I'm sure you'll find what you want.

53:51.603 --> 53:55.522
I am so excited about you boys
playing at the U of A next year.

53:55.690 --> 53:59.360
I bought my season tickets.
I got to take off early today,

53:59.444 --> 54:01.153
so lock up when you're done.

54:01.238 --> 54:03.322
- Yeah.
- You know where the key is.

54:03.365 --> 54:06.242
- Say "hey" to Coach.
- Will do.

54:06.326 --> 54:10.037
Did you hear that? He's got season
tickets. Time to start practicing.

54:11.498 --> 54:13.123
Take a breather, LeBron.

54:14.834 --> 54:17.336
Feel like your future
is laid out in front of you?

54:17.504 --> 54:20.339
- What is your point?
- I don't know.

54:22.008 --> 54:24.051
I just want my future to be my future.

54:26.221 --> 54:30.224
Do you see what happens when you
do a show? You're, like, five people.

54:30.308 --> 54:32.893
Yeah, but what's so bad about that?

54:32.978 --> 54:35.354
We used to come here as kids,
we'd be ten people.

54:35.522 --> 54:39.358
We'd be spies, superheroes, rock stars.

54:39.401 --> 54:43.988
Hold this. We were whatever we wanted
to be, whenever we wanted to be it.

54:46.157 --> 54:47.366
It was us.

54:47.534 --> 54:49.451
Yeah, we were,
like, eight years old.

54:49.536 --> 54:52.037
For the record,

54:52.080 --> 54:54.081
I was a better superhero than you were.

54:57.043 --> 55:00.129
Take it back to the place
when you know it all began

55:01.172 --> 55:03.716
We could be anything we wanna be

55:05.468 --> 55:08.554
We can tell by the noise
that the boys are back again

55:09.556 --> 55:12.057
Together making history

55:12.225 --> 55:13.517
It's time to show how

55:13.685 --> 55:16.103
To be a superhero

55:16.313 --> 55:17.688
Just like a showdown

55:17.856 --> 55:20.357
Will Smith and Bobby De Niro

55:20.525 --> 55:22.067
We're the best, no doubt

55:22.235 --> 55:23.777
Doing it like we used to do

55:23.862 --> 55:26.113
This is our town, yeah

55:26.197 --> 55:27.197
And I'm telling you

55:27.365 --> 55:32.411
Oh, the boys are back
Hey, the boys are back, that's right

55:32.495 --> 55:34.288
The boys are back
Gonna do it again

55:34.456 --> 55:36.832
Gonna wake up the neighbourhood

55:37.000 --> 55:40.878
The boys are back, yeah
The boys are back, all right

55:40.920 --> 55:42.921
Climbing up the walls
any time we want

55:43.089 --> 55:45.924
The word is out, the boys are back

55:46.092 --> 55:47.426
The boys are back

55:48.219 --> 55:49.595
Back to save the day

55:50.597 --> 55:51.805
The boys are back

55:51.973 --> 55:53.182
Oh, yeah

55:55.560 --> 55:58.645
Keep coming with the right
Win the fight, every single time

55:59.356 --> 56:02.441
Undefeated here in our house
Yeah

56:03.818 --> 56:06.820
We can rock, we can shock
Any time we like

56:07.781 --> 56:10.574
And tonight we're going all out

56:10.742 --> 56:12.159
It's time to show how

56:12.327 --> 56:14.620
To be a superhero, oh

56:14.788 --> 56:16.205
Just like a showdown

56:16.414 --> 56:18.957
Keep the pedal to the metal
Go!

56:19.125 --> 56:20.459
We're the best, no doubt

56:20.627 --> 56:22.961
Doing it like we used to do

56:23.129 --> 56:24.671
This is our town

56:24.839 --> 56:27.132
And I'm telling you
Oh, look out

56:27.217 --> 56:28.801
The boys are back, hey

56:28.843 --> 56:31.136
- The boys are back
- That's right

56:31.221 --> 56:35.140
The boys are back, gonna do it again
Gonna wake up the neighbourhood

56:35.225 --> 56:37.434
The boys are back, yeah

56:37.519 --> 56:39.436
- The boys are back
- All right

56:39.521 --> 56:45.442
Climbing up the walls, any time we want
The word is out, the boys are back

56:45.485 --> 56:47.486
Here to change the world

56:47.654 --> 56:50.114
To solve the mystery, fight the battle

56:50.281 --> 56:51.824
Save the girl

56:52.992 --> 56:55.369
No one
No one can stop us now

56:55.537 --> 57:00.833
We're the ones that make the rules

57:30.029 --> 57:32.781
No, no, no, hey! No, no, no, no! Hey!

57:35.034 --> 57:36.326
The boys are back

57:41.249 --> 57:44.042
Oh, yeah

57:44.210 --> 57:48.547
The boys are back
Hey, the boys are back, that's right

57:48.590 --> 57:50.382
The boys are back
Gonna do it again

57:50.550 --> 57:52.468
Gonna wake up the neighbourhood

57:52.635 --> 57:56.597
The boys are back, yeah
The boys are back, all right

57:56.764 --> 57:59.057
Climbing up the walls
any time we want

57:59.225 --> 58:00.893
No need to worry, 'cause...

58:01.060 --> 58:05.022
The boys are back
Hey, the boys are back

58:05.190 --> 58:07.441
The boys are back
Gonna do it again

58:07.609 --> 58:09.234
And we make it look good

58:09.402 --> 58:13.322
The boys are back
Yeah, the boys are back

58:13.490 --> 58:15.491
Tearing down the walls
any time we want

58:15.658 --> 58:17.951
I'm sure that you know by now

58:21.498 --> 58:22.706
The boys are back

58:30.298 --> 58:32.549
What are you gonna do
if Juilliard says yes?

58:34.469 --> 58:37.554
- I don't know.
- That's not what I wanted to hear.

58:38.556 --> 58:41.433
I'm getting your butt back
in the gym tomorrow. Got me?

58:41.476 --> 58:42.935
So I can whup your butt?

58:43.019 --> 58:46.605
- Dream on.
- With my eyes closed.

58:47.941 --> 58:52.069
You should be celebrating,
not keeping it a secret.

58:52.111 --> 58:55.531
The programme starts at Stanford
next week. I'll miss everything.

58:55.615 --> 58:57.866
No, you won't.
Just the show.

58:57.951 --> 59:00.786
You can come back for prom
and graduation.

59:00.870 --> 59:03.205
Girl your future is calling
loud and clear.

59:03.289 --> 59:08.126
- You have to grab it while you can.
- Taylor, stop being my mom

59:08.169 --> 59:12.297
and just be my friend.
Maybe I like it here.

59:12.382 --> 59:15.509
Maybe I wanna stay in Albuquerque
as long as possible.

59:17.971 --> 59:19.805
Maybe I'll just stay here next year.

59:19.889 --> 59:21.306
What?

59:24.686 --> 59:27.521
Stay in Albuquerque?
That makes no sense.

59:27.605 --> 59:30.232
Why do I always have to make sense?

59:30.316 --> 59:34.528
I'll still go to Stanford,
just maybe in a year.

59:34.612 --> 59:37.281
I can take classes
at U of A next fall or something.

59:37.323 --> 59:39.825
Did you say U of A?

59:43.621 --> 59:48.458
It's obvious you're not thinking clear
because you're thinking about Troy.

59:48.501 --> 59:51.503
I get it,
that he's your first crush, but...

01:00:02.682 --> 01:00:04.600
I'm sorry.

01:00:08.479 --> 01:00:11.565
I meant relationship.

01:00:14.027 --> 01:00:17.446
But there will be other guys.

01:00:18.531 --> 01:00:20.198
I promise.

01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:27.789
I... I'm late for dinner.

01:00:27.874 --> 01:00:30.208
I'm... Sorry.

01:00:44.599 --> 01:00:48.393
You know, high school feels like it's
the most important thing in the world

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:50.354
when you're in it.

01:00:50.396 --> 01:00:53.482
But that changes.

01:00:53.566 --> 01:00:56.234
Not everything has to change, Mom.

01:00:58.196 --> 01:01:00.405
I don't believe that.

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:03.492
And this from the girl
who used to think she could just

01:01:03.576 --> 01:01:07.371
reach up and rearrange
the stars in the sky.

01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:13.001
Sometimes, life just happens,

01:01:13.086 --> 01:01:16.421
whether we want it to or not.

01:01:20.093 --> 01:01:21.927
I love you too, Mom.

01:01:39.445 --> 01:01:41.446
- ...stepped on...
- Redhawks!

01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:44.408
Hey, first game is here
against Trinity.

01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:47.119
But the next game is away
against Tulane.

01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:49.287
That's in New Orleans, right?

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:51.415
Road trip!

01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:56.336
- To our boys.
- To our boys!

01:01:56.421 --> 01:01:58.547
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

01:02:01.134 --> 01:02:04.010
- Go Redhawks!
- Go Redhawks!

01:02:04.095 --> 01:02:06.471
- Redhawks!
- Seriously.

01:02:36.002 --> 01:02:38.712
If this were forever

01:02:38.796 --> 01:02:40.756
What could be better

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:44.342
We've already proved it works

01:02:44.385 --> 01:02:49.306
But in 2,123 hours

01:02:49.348 --> 01:02:52.601
Abandon the universe

01:02:52.685 --> 01:02:55.896
It's gonna make everything

01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:59.232
In our whole world change

01:02:59.317 --> 01:03:01.693
It's all changing

01:03:01.736 --> 01:03:04.988
- And you know that where we are
- Where we are

01:03:05.031 --> 01:03:09.451
Will never be the same

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:15.624
Right here

01:03:15.708 --> 01:03:20.212
- Right now
- Oh, right now

01:03:20.254 --> 01:03:24.800
Tomorrow can wait
for some other day to be

01:03:24.884 --> 01:03:29.721
To be but right now there's you and me

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:34.017
- You and me
- You and me

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:38.939
- You and me
- Right now there's you and

01:03:39.023 --> 01:03:42.692
Me

01:04:02.547 --> 01:04:04.589
What's up, man?

01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:12.722
Hi, Troy!

01:04:13.808 --> 01:04:16.560
I realised I haven't offered
my congratulations.

01:04:16.727 --> 01:04:20.647
Oh, thank you.
I'm glad the season's over, so...

01:04:20.815 --> 01:04:24.025
I didn't mean basketball, silly!
I meant Gabriella.

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:25.902
- What?
- Her missing the show

01:04:25.945 --> 01:04:30.407
is disappointing, but being selected
for Stanford's Honours Programme,

01:04:30.449 --> 01:04:33.034
that is amazing for her
and for East High.

01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:35.787
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:04:35.872 --> 01:04:38.957
Everyone else does.
The whole school's buzzing.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.961
The honourees spend time with Stanford's
top professors starting next week.

01:04:43.838 --> 01:04:45.672
- Next week?
- Look, right there.

01:04:46.799 --> 01:04:48.008
You really didn't know?

01:04:49.594 --> 01:04:52.470
OK, this is a little awkward.

01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:55.891
I guess her not telling you means
that she's on the fence about it.

01:04:57.226 --> 01:05:01.813
But who better than Troy Bolton to
encourage her to accept the honour?

01:05:01.856 --> 01:05:06.860
Since the only thing possibly holding
her back would be... you.

01:05:09.363 --> 01:05:11.698
Well, I'll see you at rehearsal.
Toodles.

01:05:28.174 --> 01:05:29.174
Hello?

01:05:29.342 --> 01:05:31.259
Hello. Somebody order a pizza pie?

01:05:32.303 --> 01:05:35.513
- I didn't order a pizza.
- Special delivery!

01:05:38.184 --> 01:05:39.351
Margherita pizza!

01:05:41.687 --> 01:05:43.021
Just the way you like it.

01:05:43.731 --> 01:05:45.106
Let's not forget,

01:05:45.274 --> 01:05:49.194
what's a picnic without
chocolate-covered strawberries?

01:05:49.278 --> 01:05:50.570
It wouldn't be right.

01:05:58.537 --> 01:06:00.246
Do you want the last strawberry?

01:06:03.167 --> 01:06:07.545
Come on. This might very well be the
best strawberry in the whole world,

01:06:07.588 --> 01:06:10.173
you wouldn't know
because you're not gonna eat it.

01:06:11.717 --> 01:06:12.884
Fine, then.

01:06:19.308 --> 01:06:20.475
You were right.

01:06:26.315 --> 01:06:27.565
So here's the thing.

01:06:30.111 --> 01:06:32.070
Your Honours Programme at Stanford...

01:06:32.113 --> 01:06:36.074
- How did you hear about that?
- A lot of people heard about it.

01:06:36.158 --> 01:06:40.078
But I wasn't one of them. Why?

01:06:40.162 --> 01:06:42.247
Because I knew what you would say.

01:06:42.415 --> 01:06:45.250
Of course you should do
the Honours Programme.

01:06:45.334 --> 01:06:48.878
Is that what you were trying to tell me?
In the backyard the other day?

01:06:49.588 --> 01:06:51.006
One of the things.

01:06:52.133 --> 01:06:53.258
What else?

01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:56.428
I've been thinking about trying
to talk my mom into staying

01:06:56.595 --> 01:07:00.223
in Albuquerque another year.
I'll just take some classes here

01:07:00.266 --> 01:07:02.642
and go to Stanford when I'm ready.

01:07:02.727 --> 01:07:05.770
You can't just put off something
as amazing as Stanford.

01:07:07.189 --> 01:07:09.065
You got to go.
It's the right thing.

01:07:09.233 --> 01:07:13.486
I always do the right thing. Maybe
I want to be a little crazy this time.

01:07:13.654 --> 01:07:16.906
Everything about my life
has always been full speed ahead.

01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:21.953
I told you, I wish it
would all just slow down...

01:07:22.913 --> 01:07:24.039
...to a stop.

01:07:25.791 --> 01:07:27.792
We're going to graduate.

01:07:27.835 --> 01:07:30.837
That's going to happen.
Nothing is going to slow down.

01:07:33.758 --> 01:07:36.593
I guess my heart just
doesn't know it's in high school.

01:07:40.806 --> 01:07:43.641
You don't have
to say anything else.

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:46.811
I'm a lot better at goodbyes than you.

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:49.314
I've had a ton of practice.

01:07:55.446 --> 01:07:57.322
Why are you saying goodbye?

01:07:58.324 --> 01:08:00.825
We still have prom.
We still have to graduate.

01:08:02.328 --> 01:08:03.661
I meant "good night".

01:08:18.511 --> 01:08:20.761
- You OK?
- Yeah.

01:08:23.057 --> 01:08:25.390
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:08:48.916 --> 01:08:52.210
I guess I should've known better

01:08:52.377 --> 01:08:56.005
To believe that my luck had changed

01:08:57.424 --> 01:09:02.595
Oh, I let my heart and forever

01:09:02.763 --> 01:09:05.807
Finally learn each other's name

01:09:06.934 --> 01:09:11.604
I tell myself this time it's different

01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:16.484
No goodbyes
'cause I can't bear to say it

01:09:16.569 --> 01:09:21.738
I'd never survive the one that's coming

01:09:21.823 --> 01:09:26.368
If I stay
Oh, no

01:09:26.537 --> 01:09:30.957
Just walk away and don't look back

01:09:31.125 --> 01:09:36.004
'Cause if my heart breaks
it's gonna hurt so bad

01:09:36.087 --> 01:09:41.050
You know I'm strong
but I can't take that

01:09:41.093 --> 01:09:44.011
Before it's too late

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:47.348
Oh, just walk away

01:09:47.515 --> 01:09:49.934
Walk, walk, walk away

01:09:50.102 --> 01:09:52.228
Oh, just walk away

01:09:52.395 --> 01:09:54.564
Walk, walk, walk away

01:09:54.732 --> 01:09:58.443
Oh, just walk away

01:09:58.485 --> 01:10:02.488
I've got to let it go

01:10:02.656 --> 01:10:07.410
Start protecting my heart and soul

01:10:07.578 --> 01:10:12.874
'Cause I don't think
I'll survive a goodbye again

01:10:13.959 --> 01:10:15.126
Not again

01:10:15.544 --> 01:10:19.881
Just walk away
Oh, and don't look back

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:25.136
'Cause if my heart breaks
it's gonna hurt so bad

01:10:25.304 --> 01:10:30.266
You know I'm strong
but I can't take that

01:10:30.309 --> 01:10:32.852
Before it's too late

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:36.481
Just walk away

01:10:36.523 --> 01:10:39.108
Walk, walk, walk away

01:10:39.151 --> 01:10:41.361
Walk away, walk away, yeah

01:10:41.487 --> 01:10:44.322
Walk, walk, walk away

01:10:44.406 --> 01:10:46.950
Walk away, walk away

01:10:46.992 --> 01:10:48.660
Walk, walk, walk away

01:10:48.744 --> 01:10:51.329
Walk away, walk away

01:10:51.372 --> 01:10:53.665
Walk, walk, walk away

01:10:53.749 --> 01:10:56.334
Walk away, walk away

01:11:02.675 --> 01:11:06.010
All right, everyone!
Attention, please! Listen up.

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:11.057
As some of you know, Miss Montez
is no longer available to us.

01:11:11.225 --> 01:11:13.893
However, the show must indeed go on.

01:11:14.061 --> 01:11:17.855
So, Sharpay,
you will do Gabriella's duet with Troy.

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:20.024
Tiara, ready
to step in for Sharpay?

01:11:20.067 --> 01:11:23.027
Those sparkling shoes
are impossible to fill.

01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:25.446
Don't worry. Kelsi will work with you.

01:11:28.284 --> 01:11:32.370
Come on, people. Let's rise
to the occasion. We're all pros here.

01:11:32.663 --> 01:11:34.664
Let's do it for Gabriella. OK?

01:11:35.499 --> 01:11:37.917
Kelsi, Troy, Ryan. Play piano.

01:11:39.086 --> 01:11:41.212
All right,
we have a lot of work to do.

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:45.300
There are sets to paint.
Drill that second number. Let's go!

01:11:45.384 --> 01:11:47.218
Come on people, double time!

01:12:08.866 --> 01:12:10.408
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:12:10.576 --> 01:12:12.577
- It's late.
- Yeah.

01:12:16.081 --> 01:12:17.290
Hear from Gabriella?

01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:19.250
Yeah.

01:12:20.544 --> 01:12:23.588
She's knee-deep in geniuses out there.

01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:26.716
Believe it or not, she says
the food's better at East High.

01:12:26.759 --> 01:12:29.469
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

01:12:29.553 --> 01:12:31.137
She still coming down for prom?

01:12:32.222 --> 01:12:33.306
Yeah.

01:12:39.271 --> 01:12:41.189
How's that big show going?

01:12:41.273 --> 01:12:42.607
You don't want to know.

01:12:48.405 --> 01:12:50.907
When were you going
to tell me about this?

01:12:52.326 --> 01:12:53.451
Juilliard.

01:12:56.455 --> 01:12:57.789
There's nothing to tell.

01:12:59.124 --> 01:13:00.750
Maybe there is.

01:13:00.793 --> 01:13:04.545
I heard you're talking to other schools.
I mean, is this serious?

01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:07.882
U of A isn't the only school
that's talked to me. You know that.

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:10.468
But it's the only school
we talked about.

01:13:10.511 --> 01:13:13.221
Chad would be disappointed
if you changed your mind.

01:13:13.305 --> 01:13:14.931
No, Chad would get over it.

01:13:16.517 --> 01:13:17.892
Would you?

01:13:18.936 --> 01:13:22.063
We've been going to U of A games
since you were a little kid.

01:13:22.147 --> 01:13:24.649
You talked about wearing
a Redhawks uniform.

01:13:24.817 --> 01:13:26.526
But I'm not a little kid anymore.

01:13:27.945 --> 01:13:31.155
You raised me to make my own choices
and I need to make them.

01:13:32.366 --> 01:13:35.660
Not you or Chad or anybody else. Me.

01:13:39.164 --> 01:13:42.208
Troy, come on. Troy!

01:14:45.606 --> 01:14:49.942
The day a door is closed

01:14:50.027 --> 01:14:53.070
The echoes fill your soul

01:14:54.072 --> 01:14:57.909
They won't say which way to go

01:14:57.951 --> 01:15:00.620
Just trust your heart

01:15:02.915 --> 01:15:07.293
To find what you're here for

01:15:07.377 --> 01:15:11.255
Open another door

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:15.051
But I'm not sure anymore

01:15:15.093 --> 01:15:17.762
It's just so hard

01:15:39.743 --> 01:15:41.452
Voices in my head

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:45.456
Tell me they know best
Got me on the edge

01:15:45.624 --> 01:15:48.000
They're pushing, pushing
They're pushing

01:15:48.168 --> 01:15:52.296
I know they've got a plan
But the ball's in my hands

01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:56.342
This time it's man to man
I'm driving, fighting inside a

01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:59.220
World that's upside down

01:15:59.471 --> 01:16:01.138
And spinning faster

01:16:01.306 --> 01:16:05.059
What do I do now without you

01:16:05.227 --> 01:16:09.188
I don't know where to go
What's the right team

01:16:09.815 --> 01:16:13.818
I want my own thing
So bad I'm going to scream

01:16:13.986 --> 01:16:16.445
I can't choose, so confused

01:16:16.613 --> 01:16:20.324
What's it all mean
I want my own dream

01:16:20.492 --> 01:16:22.702
So bad I'm going to scream

01:16:27.082 --> 01:16:31.168
I'm kicking down the walls
I've gotta make 'em fall

01:16:31.336 --> 01:16:34.714
Just break through 'em all
I'm punching, crashing

01:16:34.881 --> 01:16:39.760
I'm gonna fight to find myself
Me and no one else

01:16:40.053 --> 01:16:43.389
Which way, I can't tell
I'm searching, searching

01:16:43.557 --> 01:16:48.227
Can't find the way that I should turn
I should turn right or left

01:16:48.395 --> 01:16:52.690
It's like nothing works without you

01:16:52.858 --> 01:16:57.320
I don't know where to go
What's the right team

01:16:57.362 --> 01:17:01.365
I want my own thing
So bad I'm gonna scream

01:17:01.533 --> 01:17:05.620
I can't choose, so confused
What's it all mean

01:17:06.038 --> 01:17:10.750
I want my own dream
So bad I'm gonna scream

01:17:11.335 --> 01:17:15.921
Yeah, the clock's running down
Hear the crowd gettin' loud

01:17:16.089 --> 01:17:19.925
I'm consumed by the sound
Is it her, is it love

01:17:20.093 --> 01:17:21.927
Can the music ever be enough

01:17:22.095 --> 01:17:24.221
Gotta work it out, gotta work it out

01:17:24.389 --> 01:17:26.641
You can do it, you can do it

01:17:44.701 --> 01:17:47.161
I don't know where to go

01:17:47.245 --> 01:17:48.913
What's the right team?

01:17:49.039 --> 01:17:51.207
I want my own thing

01:17:51.249 --> 01:17:53.417
So bad I'm gonna scream

01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:55.920
I can't choose, so confused

01:17:55.962 --> 01:17:57.922
What's it all mean?

01:17:57.964 --> 01:17:59.632
I want my own dream

01:17:59.758 --> 01:18:02.426
So bad I'm gonna scream

01:18:26.576 --> 01:18:29.704
Miss D?

01:18:29.788 --> 01:18:31.622
I know I'm not supposed to be here.

01:18:31.873 --> 01:18:33.290
Aren't you?

01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:35.918
Nor should I be
at this hour I suppose,

01:18:35.961 --> 01:18:39.505
but I am trying to rebalance a show

01:18:39.673 --> 01:18:43.718
in which Sharpay now plays
the role of Miss Montez.

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:46.554
And the reason for your visit is?

01:18:48.181 --> 01:18:52.810
I don't know. I think I feel
like this is a good place to...

01:18:52.853 --> 01:18:57.898
- Scream? Feel free.
- Or just to think.

01:18:58.859 --> 01:19:03.779
The stage can be a wonderful partner
in the process of self-discovery.

01:19:03.822 --> 01:19:05.656
You seem comfortable up there.

01:19:07.993 --> 01:19:08.993
I do?

01:19:09.995 --> 01:19:15.332
Which is why I submitted an application
in your name to Juilliard.

01:19:16.334 --> 01:19:17.710
It was you.

01:19:17.878 --> 01:19:20.463
Better to consider opportunities now

01:19:20.505 --> 01:19:24.383
than in ten years when life
may limit your choices.

01:19:24.551 --> 01:19:26.385
If I overstepped, I apologise.

01:19:27.304 --> 01:19:29.221
No. No, I'm not mad.

01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:33.309
I'm just confused.

01:19:34.853 --> 01:19:38.439
What a life in the theatre
has taught me is

01:19:38.523 --> 01:19:41.442
to trust one's instincts.

01:19:41.526 --> 01:19:46.447
And that takes courage.
A quality you don't seem to lack.

01:19:52.537 --> 01:19:54.538
Last one out turns off the lights.

01:20:15.227 --> 01:20:17.645
So walk, walk, walk. Jump in.

01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:21.732
Around the world and spin out.
See? You got it.

01:20:21.817 --> 01:20:24.318
- You're easier to dance with than her.
- My turn.

01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:26.237
OK. Here we go. From the top.

01:20:26.404 --> 01:20:29.198
Walk, walk, walk.
Jump down. Around the world.

01:20:29.366 --> 01:20:30.699
Heads up! Heads up!

01:20:33.245 --> 01:20:38.833
All right, everyone. Let's
just take five, all right? Take five.

01:20:38.917 --> 01:20:41.210
You two. House up.

01:20:42.087 --> 01:20:46.924
Hoops Man. Over here. You look like
you're having the time of your life.

01:20:48.593 --> 01:20:52.596
I'm messing up the dances.
I'm messing up all the songs. I'm sorry.

01:20:52.639 --> 01:20:55.099
It's all of us. And all of us
pretty much know why.

01:20:55.183 --> 01:20:59.270
If it wasn't for Gabriella, this musical
would have been another "Sharpay Show".

01:21:01.731 --> 01:21:03.482
- It'll be fine.
- Yeah.

01:21:21.877 --> 01:21:24.295
- Hey, Mama!
- Hi.

01:21:28.216 --> 01:21:29.466
Wow.

01:21:30.969 --> 01:21:32.303
Gorgeous!

01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:36.473
I'd like to take credit,
but Gabriella picked it out.

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:39.810
I ordered that corsage you showed me.
It's going to be perfect.

01:21:39.978 --> 01:21:41.228
Thanks, Mom.

01:21:41.396 --> 01:21:43.147
- You did good.
- Thank you.

01:21:43.315 --> 01:21:44.523
It's Gabriella.

01:21:46.443 --> 01:21:48.819
Hey! I just showed my mom the tux.

01:21:49.529 --> 01:21:50.863
We need to talk.

01:21:52.866 --> 01:21:57.036
I can't be a little adult right now,
Troy. I'm hoping you understand that.

01:21:57.370 --> 01:21:59.038
No, don't even say that.

01:22:04.044 --> 01:22:06.003
Gabriella. Prom is in two days.

01:22:06.046 --> 01:22:08.297
You're supposed to be
on a plane now.

01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:11.508
It's taking me two weeks
to get used to being away from you.

01:22:12.218 --> 01:22:15.930
- From East High and all my friends.
- I know. I know.

01:22:16.014 --> 01:22:19.683
So, what, I come back,
go to prom and leave again?

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:22.019
And then it's graduation,
and leave again?

01:22:22.437 --> 01:22:25.522
- That was our plan.
- I don't think I can do it, Troy.

01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:30.361
- I think I've run out of goodbyes.
- Why do you keep saying goodbye?

01:22:33.239 --> 01:22:35.324
I love you, Wildcat.

01:22:35.367 --> 01:22:38.577
But I need to stay
right where I am. I'm sorry.

01:22:40.747 --> 01:22:42.081
Gabriella.

01:22:48.421 --> 01:22:49.964
She's not coming back, man.

01:22:51.383 --> 01:22:54.426
- Is she going to miss prom?
- No, she's not coming back at all.

01:22:56.513 --> 01:22:59.807
Wow. That's lousy, man.

01:23:01.726 --> 01:23:02.810
It really is.

01:23:04.062 --> 01:23:05.187
But, hey, man.

01:23:06.731 --> 01:23:10.275
Everybody knows you don't bring
the girl with you after high school.

01:23:11.695 --> 01:23:16.281
Look, Gabriella is already
one step ahead. As usual.

01:23:17.909 --> 01:23:21.203
Right now you got
to snap out of it, dude.

01:23:21.246 --> 01:23:25.624
She's off to Stanford.
And, look, I am right there with you.

01:23:25.709 --> 01:23:30.421
Taylor's heading to Yale.
And you and me are going to U of A.

01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:33.924
It's a new ball game.

01:23:38.930 --> 01:23:41.765
Maybe I don't see my life
as a ball game anymore, man.

01:23:43.935 --> 01:23:44.935
Look.

01:23:46.771 --> 01:23:49.690
You're gonna go to the prom with us,
be with your friends.

01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:53.277
You're gonna have
a good time. All right?

01:23:53.319 --> 01:23:56.780
I don't plan on missing my prom.

01:23:56.865 --> 01:23:58.198
There we go.

01:24:28.772 --> 01:24:31.356
I figured you'd be
the last one out of the building.

01:24:34.235 --> 01:24:35.486
I don't believe this.

01:24:36.279 --> 01:24:38.238
I took a wrong turn on the way to prom.

01:24:39.657 --> 01:24:40.783
So did you.

01:24:41.951 --> 01:24:46.705
You are so crazy, Wildcat.
And what is it with you and trees?

01:24:47.457 --> 01:24:49.958
I guess I see things
more clearly from up here.

01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:52.503
You look handsome.

01:24:53.421 --> 01:24:57.508
Prom is tonight in Albuquerque.
It's a thousand miles away.

01:25:02.138 --> 01:25:04.223
My prom is wherever you are.

01:25:06.351 --> 01:25:10.437
If I'm going to have a last dance
at East High, it's going to be with you.

01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:20.864
Take my hand
I'll take the lead

01:25:20.949 --> 01:25:25.369
And every turn will be safe with me

01:25:26.287 --> 01:25:30.791
Don't be afraid
Afraid to fall

01:25:31.626 --> 01:25:37.214
You know I'll catch you through it all

01:25:37.298 --> 01:25:40.926
- And you can't keep us apart
- Even a thousand miles

01:25:41.136 --> 01:25:43.011
Can't keep us apart

01:25:43.054 --> 01:25:48.642
'Cause my heart is wherever you are

01:25:48.726 --> 01:25:50.853
It's like catching lightning

01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:54.731
The chances of finding someone

01:25:55.233 --> 01:25:57.234
Like you

01:25:59.237 --> 01:26:01.280
It's one in a million

01:26:01.447 --> 01:26:04.116
The chances of feeling

01:26:04.284 --> 01:26:07.619
The way we do

01:26:08.872 --> 01:26:14.126
And with every step together

01:26:14.335 --> 01:26:19.089
We just keep on getting better

01:26:19.924 --> 01:26:24.094
- So can I have this dance?
- Can I have this dance?

01:26:24.262 --> 01:26:27.306
Can I have this dance?

01:26:28.975 --> 01:26:34.605
- Can I have this dance?
- This dance

01:26:34.689 --> 01:26:39.985
Can I have this dance?

01:27:07.972 --> 01:27:13.018
You know... I'm not the only one that
changed when you came to East High.

01:27:15.063 --> 01:27:19.858
Kids that I used to just pass in
the hallway... we're friends now.

01:27:19.943 --> 01:27:22.319
And we're supposed
to be doing a show together.

01:27:24.656 --> 01:27:27.908
The problem is, East High
changed when you got there.

01:27:27.992 --> 01:27:30.494
And now it's changed again
because you left.

01:27:34.749 --> 01:27:38.293
You might be ready
to say goodbye to East High,

01:27:38.336 --> 01:27:41.338
but East High's not ready
to say goodbye to you.

01:27:48.846 --> 01:27:52.641
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the final
call for curtain. Find your seats.

01:27:56.437 --> 01:27:59.273
Hey, Mommy and Daddy,
how was Africa? No, I mean India.

01:27:59.607 --> 01:28:02.651
Fabulous.
The show is starting soon.

01:28:03.653 --> 01:28:05.237
You're in the lobby?

01:28:05.321 --> 01:28:08.198
OK. Toodles. And I love the roses!

01:28:11.869 --> 01:28:15.664
Hey, what's up?
We haven't formally met,

01:28:15.707 --> 01:28:18.709
but I feel like I know you
in sort of a vibe-y level.

01:28:18.751 --> 01:28:20.502
I'm Jimmy "The Rocket" Zara.

01:28:21.754 --> 01:28:24.798
"Jimmy The Rocket"? What are you?
A Muppet gangster?

01:28:26.217 --> 01:28:30.679
What is that?
Is that your cologne or a toxic spill?

01:28:30.847 --> 01:28:34.891
Oh, yeah. It's called "Babe Magnet".
Bought it just for the show.

01:28:35.018 --> 01:28:36.018
You like it?

01:28:39.272 --> 01:28:40.731
That is so gross.

01:28:40.773 --> 01:28:43.358
Hello! Send Troy in to see me.
I need to run the song.

01:28:45.778 --> 01:28:49.197
Yo! Dion.
Troy Bolton just sent me a text.

01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:50.782
Probably just checking in.

01:28:51.743 --> 01:28:55.579
"Been driving all night. I'll try
to make it for the second act.

01:28:55.747 --> 01:28:58.915
- Break a leg.
- "Break a leg"? What does that mean?

01:28:59.083 --> 01:29:02.044
Dude, that's show biz
for "you're going on tonight."

01:29:02.086 --> 01:29:03.503
- As Troy?
- Yeah.

01:29:03.588 --> 01:29:05.005
- Onstage?
- Yeah.

01:29:05.089 --> 01:29:06.506
- Oh, no.
- Get it!

01:29:06.591 --> 01:29:10.886
All right. Notify Sharpay. I will take
care of Kelsi and the orchestra.

01:29:10.928 --> 01:29:12.095
Hold up, Miss D.

01:29:13.598 --> 01:29:15.390
I think he stopped breathing.

01:29:15.558 --> 01:29:19.436
Well, then give him the Heimlich!
It's show-time!

01:29:21.773 --> 01:29:23.940
- Go get 'em.
- Come on.

01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:27.277
- Hello, Mrs Evans.
- Hello.

01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:28.820
- Enjoy the show.
- Thank you.

01:29:32.325 --> 01:29:35.786
It's so wonderful, yes.
Seats right here.

01:29:35.953 --> 01:29:38.205
Thank you for coming. Enjoy the show.

01:30:04.565 --> 01:30:09.569
It's our last chance to share the stage

01:30:09.821 --> 01:30:14.116
Before we go our separate ways

01:30:14.575 --> 01:30:19.538
High school wasn't meant to last forever

01:30:22.959 --> 01:30:28.171
It's our last chance for us to shine

01:30:28.339 --> 01:30:33.009
To bring you music one more time

01:30:33.177 --> 01:30:35.762
So come on, come on, come on

01:30:35.847 --> 01:30:42.769
Come on, come on, come on

01:30:52.864 --> 01:30:57.200
W-I-L-D Wildcats!
You know you're on

01:30:57.368 --> 01:31:01.455
W-I-L-D Wildcats!
Come on, come on

01:31:01.622 --> 01:31:04.708
East High boys
Let's make some noise

01:31:04.876 --> 01:31:09.421
Oh, yeah, W-I-L-D Wildcats!
Now's the time

01:31:13.718 --> 01:31:15.552
This is the last time to get it right

01:31:15.595 --> 01:31:18.054
This is the last chance
to make it our night

01:31:18.222 --> 01:31:20.140
We got to show what we're all about

01:31:20.308 --> 01:31:22.017
Work together

01:31:22.185 --> 01:31:24.186
This is the last chance to make our mark

01:31:24.353 --> 01:31:26.271
History will know who we are

01:31:26.439 --> 01:31:30.692
This is the last game so make it count
It's now or never

01:31:42.788 --> 01:31:45.248
EntrÃ©e.

01:31:45.333 --> 01:31:48.001
Good evening, Miss Evans.
Two minutes till places.

01:31:48.169 --> 01:31:51.046
Tell Troy to come up.
I want to rehearse the kissing.

01:31:51.214 --> 01:31:53.256
Hasn't anybody told you that Troy...

01:31:54.091 --> 01:31:55.884
Go!

01:31:57.053 --> 01:32:00.931
I want it all
I want it, I want it, I want it

01:32:00.973 --> 01:32:03.475
I gotta have my star on the door

01:32:03.643 --> 01:32:05.477
I want the world, nothing less

01:32:05.645 --> 01:32:09.856
All the glam and the press
Only giving me the best reviews

01:32:10.608 --> 01:32:12.943
I want it all, want it all, want it all

01:32:13.027 --> 01:32:14.611
He's the choreographer.

01:32:15.738 --> 01:32:17.197
Kick it, girls

01:32:17.281 --> 01:32:19.616
I want it all, want it all, want it all

01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:23.119
Want it all, want it all

01:32:23.204 --> 01:32:28.124
We want it all

01:32:28.209 --> 01:32:30.418
My band! Thank you!

01:32:30.586 --> 01:32:32.837
East High, you're amazing! Good night.

01:32:34.966 --> 01:32:38.426
Yeah!

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:41.721
That's my boy!

01:32:44.141 --> 01:32:47.811
We have to save something. I'm at
the balcony, don't forget the special.

01:32:47.895 --> 01:32:52.065
You forget the special. Where's Troy?
OK, he's around here somewhere.

01:32:54.068 --> 01:32:56.111
Cute pants.

01:32:56.153 --> 01:32:57.153
You're on.

01:33:20.511 --> 01:33:24.973
I got a lot of things I have to do

01:33:25.016 --> 01:33:29.853
All these distractions
Our future's coming soon

01:33:29.895 --> 01:33:33.815
We're being pulled
a hundred different directions

01:33:33.983 --> 01:33:36.109
Focus, Jimmy. Come on, man.

01:33:38.988 --> 01:33:41.197
You're on my mind
You're in my heart

01:33:41.282 --> 01:33:43.742
It doesn't matter where we are

01:33:43.909 --> 01:33:45.702
We'll be all right

01:33:45.870 --> 01:34:02.010
Even if we're miles apart

01:34:10.561 --> 01:34:15.231
Even if we're miles
and miles and miles apart

01:34:16.275 --> 01:34:17.901
I think we have a problem.

01:34:22.948 --> 01:34:26.910
All I wanna do

01:34:26.994 --> 01:34:29.496
Is be with you

01:34:29.664 --> 01:34:32.290
Be with you

01:34:32.458 --> 01:34:35.877
There's nothing we can't do

01:34:36.045 --> 01:34:40.382
Just wanna be with you, only you

01:34:40.549 --> 01:34:43.760
And no matter where life takes us

01:34:43.928 --> 01:34:47.555
Nothing can break us apart

01:34:48.933 --> 01:34:51.976
I just wanna be with...

01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:54.604
You

01:34:56.816 --> 01:34:58.108
Yeah!

01:34:59.610 --> 01:35:00.902
Thank you very much.

01:35:00.945 --> 01:35:03.655
- You rule!
- Best crowd I've ever had.

01:35:04.907 --> 01:35:06.157
Hey!

01:35:06.742 --> 01:35:09.452
Perfect. Go for it.
Save the day. Whoopee!

01:35:10.454 --> 01:35:12.288
What?

01:35:12.331 --> 01:35:13.957
You guys got to see this.

01:35:14.291 --> 01:35:17.293
No, you guys are awesome.
Thank you.

01:35:21.799 --> 01:35:23.133
- They're here!
- Kels!

01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:28.138
- Let's go! You're on!
- Oh, man. Hey!

01:35:31.183 --> 01:35:32.475
That's my dress!

01:35:33.227 --> 01:35:36.104
I had one made just like it.
Only better.

01:35:36.147 --> 01:35:38.231
I'm playing Sharpay, remember?

01:35:39.817 --> 01:35:42.986
You're not a singer.
You're a London schoolgirl.

01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:46.406
Yes. London Academy of Dramatic Arts.

01:35:46.949 --> 01:35:51.161
I took the job with you to learn
the ropes at East High. Now I have.

01:35:51.203 --> 01:35:55.832
Now, step aside. I need to warm up
and give a good first impression.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.877
Since it will be
my drama department next year.

01:35:59.837 --> 01:36:04.174
But you were so loyal. So sweet.

01:36:04.759 --> 01:36:07.802
That's called acting.
You should try it sometime.

01:36:12.141 --> 01:36:13.391
Toodles.

01:36:16.937 --> 01:36:20.815
You know how life can be
It changes overnight

01:36:21.358 --> 01:36:26.070
It's sunny then raining
but it's all right

01:36:26.238 --> 01:36:28.031
A friend like you

01:36:28.199 --> 01:36:30.366
Always makes it easy

01:36:30.868 --> 01:36:32.535
I know that you get me

01:36:32.703 --> 01:36:34.621
Every time

01:36:35.456 --> 01:36:40.460
Through every up, through every down
You know I'll always be around

01:36:40.628 --> 01:36:45.882
Through anything you can count on me

01:36:46.967 --> 01:36:49.844
All I wanna do

01:36:50.012 --> 01:36:53.056
- That is Troy Bolton.
- Is be with you

01:36:53.724 --> 01:36:55.892
Be with you

01:36:56.352 --> 01:36:59.229
There's nothing we can't do

01:36:59.772 --> 01:37:04.734
Just wanna be with you, only you

01:37:04.819 --> 01:37:07.487
No matter where life takes us

01:37:07.655 --> 01:37:11.407
Nothing can break us apart

01:37:11.575 --> 01:37:16.329
You know it's true
I just wanna be with you

01:37:22.378 --> 01:37:24.754
I just wanna be with you

01:37:24.839 --> 01:37:27.090
The sun will always shine

01:37:27.258 --> 01:37:29.843
That's how you make me feel

01:37:29.969 --> 01:37:32.220
We're gonna be all right

01:37:32.388 --> 01:37:34.722
'Cause what we have is real

01:37:34.890 --> 01:37:38.768
And we will always be together

01:37:38.853 --> 01:37:42.689
All I wanna do

01:37:42.773 --> 01:37:45.149
Is be with you

01:37:45.276 --> 01:37:47.986
Be with you

01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:51.531
There's nothing we can't do

01:37:51.615 --> 01:37:56.244
Just wanna be with you, only you

01:37:56.287 --> 01:37:59.372
No matter where life takes us

01:37:59.456 --> 01:38:03.042
Nothing can break us apart

01:38:03.127 --> 01:38:04.586
You know it's true

01:38:04.628 --> 01:38:07.964
I just wanna be with you

01:38:09.133 --> 01:38:11.801
All I wanna do

01:38:11.969 --> 01:38:25.773
All that I wanna do is be with you

01:38:25.858 --> 01:38:28.443
All that I wanna do

01:38:28.527 --> 01:38:30.653
I just wanna be with you

01:38:44.835 --> 01:38:49.088
Sharpay Evans, I believe
you're in the wrong costume.

01:38:54.637 --> 01:38:58.306
Who's that girl?
She's so fine

01:38:58.474 --> 01:39:01.809
Who's that girl?
I don't recognise

01:39:01.977 --> 01:39:05.355
Who's that girl?
She looks so good, yeah

01:39:05.522 --> 01:39:09.150
Guess you never really noticed
but you probably should

01:39:09.318 --> 01:39:12.570
Big fun
On the night of nights

01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:15.365
The night of nights
Tonight

01:39:16.241 --> 01:39:19.953
Let's dance
On the night of nights

01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:22.288
You know we're gonna do it right

01:39:22.456 --> 01:39:24.874
- It's gonna be our night
- You know it

01:39:25.042 --> 01:39:26.709
- To remember
- For all time

01:39:26.835 --> 01:39:28.753
Surprise. Big fun

01:39:29.505 --> 01:39:31.923
- It's gonna be the night
- We love it

01:39:32.091 --> 01:39:34.384
- To last forever
- The rest of our lives

01:39:34.551 --> 01:39:37.387
We'll never ever ever forget
It's gonna be...

01:39:37.554 --> 01:39:39.138
- My night
- Oh, yeah

01:39:39.306 --> 01:39:41.140
- All together
- Say it loud

01:39:41.308 --> 01:39:43.559
Come on now
Everyone, that's right

01:39:43.727 --> 01:39:46.187
- It's gonna be a night
- You can bet

01:39:46.230 --> 01:39:48.398
- To remember
- Hear the crowd

01:39:48.565 --> 01:39:51.359
And never ever ever, never ever ever

01:39:51.527 --> 01:39:54.487
Never ever never ever ever forget

01:40:10.587 --> 01:40:12.839
- Thank you so much.
- It was such a great show.

01:40:12.923 --> 01:40:14.716
See them out, please.
Thank you.

01:40:29.273 --> 01:40:34.402
Together, together, together, everyone

01:40:34.445 --> 01:40:38.239
Together, together, come on
Let's have some fun

01:40:38.407 --> 01:40:41.409
Ladies and gentlemen! Our seniors!

01:40:45.539 --> 01:40:50.793
Kelsi Nielsen, the Juilliard School
Scholarship Recipient.

01:40:50.878 --> 01:40:51.919
Music.

01:40:55.841 --> 01:40:57.842
Jason Cross.

01:40:59.178 --> 01:41:01.345
You did it. You graduated.

01:41:07.186 --> 01:41:12.482
Taylor McKessie, Yale University,
with honours, Political Science.

01:41:13.567 --> 01:41:15.610
And I am pleased to announce that due

01:41:15.694 --> 01:41:18.488
to the excellence
displayed here this evening,

01:41:18.655 --> 01:41:22.075
the Juilliard School has made
an extraordinary decision.

01:41:22.409 --> 01:41:27.163
Another senior is being offered
a Juilliard scholarship.

01:41:27.247 --> 01:41:32.001
Congratulations, Mr Ryan Evans,
Choreography.

01:41:36.006 --> 01:41:38.841
And congratulations,
Miss Sharpay Evans.

01:41:39.009 --> 01:41:42.178
University of Albuquerque,
Performing Arts.

01:41:42.346 --> 01:41:46.015
Miss Evans has agreed
to return to East High next fall

01:41:46.183 --> 01:41:49.519
to assist me in running
the Drama Department.

01:41:51.522 --> 01:41:56.526
And now a senior
who I believe has a decision to make.

01:41:56.777 --> 01:41:59.779
Mr Troy Bolton. Troy.

01:42:07.246 --> 01:42:08.913
I've chosen basketball.

01:42:10.707 --> 01:42:12.792
But I've also chosen theatre.

01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:24.846
The University of California,
Berkeley, offers me both.

01:42:24.888 --> 01:42:27.515
That's where I'm going
to be attending next fall.

01:42:30.227 --> 01:42:34.897
But most of all, I choose
the person who inspires my heart.

01:42:36.316 --> 01:42:40.987
Which is why I picked
a school that's exactly 32.7...

01:42:42.281 --> 01:42:43.447
...miles from you.

01:42:46.243 --> 01:42:51.455
Miss Gabriella Montez,
Stanford University, Pre-Law.

01:42:59.131 --> 01:43:01.757
Next, Mr Chad Danforth.

01:43:01.925 --> 01:43:06.053
University of Albuquerque,
Basketball Scholarship!

01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:07.847
He's gone.

01:43:10.142 --> 01:43:12.143
Mr Danforth.

01:43:28.952 --> 01:43:31.120
He goes up for the shot and it's good!

01:43:31.163 --> 01:43:33.623
East High Wildcat victory
for the record books!

01:43:42.883 --> 01:43:45.468
Once they hand us that diploma,
we're done here?

01:43:45.552 --> 01:43:48.012
What makes you think
we're getting diplomas?

01:43:52.392 --> 01:43:56.479
One question: does Berkeley play?

01:43:56.647 --> 01:44:00.816
Oh, yeah. We're scheduled to kick
some Redhawk butt next November.

01:44:03.153 --> 01:44:04.487
Game on, Hoops.

01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:12.662
One more steal. The final point.

01:44:14.831 --> 01:44:18.417
Danforth! Bolton!
You get out there and you get onstage!

01:44:18.752 --> 01:44:20.836
I never thought I'd hear
my dad say that.

01:44:35.394 --> 01:44:39.272
We're all in this together

01:44:39.356 --> 01:44:41.232
Once we know

01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:43.776
That we are
We're all stars

01:44:43.944 --> 01:44:45.569
And we see that

01:44:45.654 --> 01:44:49.365
East High is a place where teachers
encouraged us to break the status quo.

01:44:50.450 --> 01:44:52.952
And define ourselves as we choose.

01:44:53.912 --> 01:44:56.956
Where a jock can cook up
a mean crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e.

01:44:58.709 --> 01:45:02.169
And the brainiac
can break down on the dance floor.

01:45:07.342 --> 01:45:11.679
It's a place where one person...
if it's the right person...

01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:18.060
...changes us all.

01:45:20.022 --> 01:45:23.566
East High is having friends that
we'll keep for the rest of our lives.

01:45:25.193 --> 01:45:28.529
And I guess that means we
really are all in this together.

01:45:31.158 --> 01:45:32.825
Because once a Wildcat...

01:45:34.202 --> 01:45:36.120
...always a Wildcat.

01:45:37.205 --> 01:45:39.623
- Yeah, man.
- Thank you!

01:45:47.341 --> 01:45:49.967
Thank you, sir. Thank you very much.

01:46:29.216 --> 01:46:32.301
Looking forward from centre stage
to graduation day

01:46:32.469 --> 01:46:34.595
Time to get the future started

01:46:34.763 --> 01:46:38.599
What we leave what we take with us
No matter what

01:46:38.642 --> 01:46:42.895
It's something we're a part of
We learned to fly

01:46:42.979 --> 01:46:45.398
Together side by side

01:46:46.483 --> 01:46:49.819
I just hope the rest of my life

01:46:50.862 --> 01:46:52.071
Will feel as good as my

01:46:52.239 --> 01:46:57.827
High School Musical
Who says we have to let it go?

01:46:57.869 --> 01:47:00.246
It's the best part we've ever known

01:47:00.414 --> 01:47:02.665
Step into the future

01:47:02.707 --> 01:47:06.335
But hold on to High School Musical

01:47:06.503 --> 01:47:09.171
Let's celebrate where we come from

01:47:09.548 --> 01:47:13.676
The friends who've been there all along
Just like

01:47:15.178 --> 01:47:18.514
A High School Musical

01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:25.020
Improvisation without a script
No one's written it

01:47:25.230 --> 01:47:27.106
And now we have the chance to

01:47:27.274 --> 01:47:30.860
But some day we'll be looking back
Memories we'll have

01:47:31.027 --> 01:47:33.320
All the songs that we lived through

01:47:33.363 --> 01:47:38.033
The best of times
So why leave them behind

01:47:39.119 --> 01:47:42.413
Why can't the rest of my life

01:47:43.415 --> 01:47:47.168
Be like my
High School Musical?

01:47:47.335 --> 01:47:49.795
Who says we have to let it go?

01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:52.882
It's the best part we've ever known

01:47:52.924 --> 01:47:55.050
Step into the future

01:47:55.135 --> 01:47:59.054
But hold on to High School Musical

01:47:59.097 --> 01:48:01.807
Let's celebrate where we come from

01:48:01.975 --> 01:48:05.769
The friends who've been there all along
That's right

01:48:08.231 --> 01:48:11.025
Now we finally realise

01:48:11.067 --> 01:48:13.402
Who we are
It just took some time

01:48:13.862 --> 01:48:17.323
We had to live
and to learn to see the truth

01:48:17.908 --> 01:48:19.783
Learn to see the truth

01:48:19.951 --> 01:48:25.122
That nothing's ever impossible
Into the future we all free fall

01:48:25.624 --> 01:48:28.292
But forever
we'll always have high school

01:48:32.214 --> 01:48:34.340
Time to party now
Celebrate

01:48:35.091 --> 01:48:37.343
Because the world's one big stage

01:48:37.511 --> 01:48:40.513
Any part you want can be yours

01:48:41.348 --> 01:48:42.806
Everybody sing

01:48:43.892 --> 01:48:46.560
But the show is never going to close

01:48:46.603 --> 01:48:48.938
