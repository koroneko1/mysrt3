And what better
way to build your

01:17.773 --> 01:19.253
sponsorship portfolio

01:19.383 --> 01:21.298
than with a brand cocktail party

01:21.429 --> 01:22.691
come New Year's Eve.

01:22.778 --> 01:24.693
Okay, we're listening.

01:24.780 --> 01:26.260
But a brand cocktail party?

01:26.390 --> 01:27.870
- What brand?
- All the brands.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.698
You just leave that part to us.

01:29.828 --> 01:31.787
You bring us your best
influencer clients.

01:31.917 --> 01:34.398
- And we bring the brands to you.
- Such as?

01:34.485 --> 01:35.747
How about we start
with wardrobe?

01:35.834 --> 01:38.750
Boots, heels, cocktail attire,

01:38.881 --> 01:41.797
everything anyone in attendance
is wearing. Branded.

01:41.927 --> 01:44.495
And then the champagne.
The wine.

01:44.582 --> 01:47.281
- Even our colorful cupcakes...
- All brand.

01:47.411 --> 01:49.413
And don't forget to tell them
what's in our swag bags, Tipper.

01:49.544 --> 01:53.287
Purses. Watches.
Beauty products.

01:53.374 --> 01:56.116
Even dog treats!
All of it brand.

01:56.203 --> 01:57.856
But let's not stop there.

01:57.987 --> 02:00.076
What better way to flaunt
all these new brands

02:00.207 --> 02:03.384
than with our very own
interactive photo shoot

02:03.514 --> 02:06.038
where you and your influencers
can take fun photos

02:06.126 --> 02:07.083
with each
of your brands.

02:07.214 --> 02:08.476
With your own new camera,

02:08.563 --> 02:11.087
sponsored by one of our brands.

02:12.654 --> 02:13.829
I think you have
something here.

02:13.959 --> 02:15.135
Let us discuss with
our clients

02:15.265 --> 02:16.614
and come back with
an answer soon?

02:21.924 --> 02:24.100
Look, I'm gonna be real
with you guys for a second.

02:24.231 --> 02:25.928
If this works the way it could,

02:26.058 --> 02:27.451
our clients are gonna wanna do
a lot more of these.

02:27.538 --> 02:29.366
Great. One for every holiday.

02:29.453 --> 02:32.021
Saint Patty's Public
Figure Soiree!

02:32.152 --> 02:33.762
In theory
that sounds lovely,

02:33.849 --> 02:35.894
but you two don't have
the infrastructure alone

02:36.025 --> 02:37.548
to handle such a feat.

02:37.679 --> 02:38.854
You're gonna need a lot
more help than just

02:38.984 --> 02:40.421
the two of you,
and more space.

02:40.508 --> 02:42.118
But that's why
we got this space.

02:42.249 --> 02:43.946
We have renters,
but we left room for growth.

02:44.076 --> 02:45.600
- So if--
- When...

02:45.687 --> 02:48.603
When we can pull this off,
which we will,

02:48.690 --> 02:50.170
we will take up
the entire space,

02:50.257 --> 02:51.736
hire a full-time staff,

02:51.867 --> 02:54.652
get you and your clients
exactly what you need.

02:54.739 --> 02:56.654
Hm, so if what
you're saying is,

02:56.741 --> 02:58.395
you wanna start a real partnership

02:58.526 --> 03:01.790
direct from client to brand,
I'm open to that.

03:01.920 --> 03:04.836
But you'll need
an infrastructure to do that.

03:04.967 --> 03:06.751
And money.

03:06.882 --> 03:08.971
Our influencers are
the best in the business.

03:09.058 --> 03:10.668
I'm the best in the business.

03:10.755 --> 03:13.323
And I expect you
to deliver the same.

03:13.410 --> 03:16.674
Anyway, I look forward to
seeing more of what you can do.

03:16.805 --> 03:18.546
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

03:18.633 --> 03:19.895
- Bye.
- Bye.

03:32.473 --> 03:35.606
Wow. You really cleaned up
out here, huh?

03:35.737 --> 03:37.521
You know, somebody had to.
The place was a mess.

03:37.608 --> 03:40.045
No signs of a buried treasure?

03:42.309 --> 03:44.746
And the Christmas lights?

03:44.876 --> 03:46.226
I'm doing it for Mrs. Marley.

03:48.271 --> 03:51.840
Ev. Mrs. Marley is gone.

03:51.970 --> 03:54.451
No, come on, where's your
Christmas spirit, huh, Ricky?

03:54.582 --> 03:56.671
Because I still feel
Mrs. Marley's right here,

03:56.758 --> 03:57.585
everywhere I go.

03:57.715 --> 03:59.108
Uh-huh? Huh.

03:59.195 --> 04:00.979
Did she mention
you're trespassing?

04:01.110 --> 04:02.329
Well, I wouldn't be
if you gave me the keys

04:02.459 --> 04:03.939
and the deed already.

04:04.069 --> 04:06.028
The city is selling
the place, Ev.

04:06.115 --> 04:07.812
What?

04:07.943 --> 04:10.641
I-I held out as long
as I could with them.

04:10.772 --> 04:13.601
They're putting a realtor on the
property to sell by New Year's.

04:13.688 --> 04:16.125
What? Well, there's nothing
that we can do?

04:16.212 --> 04:19.041
I mean, can I make like
a down payment or something?

04:19.128 --> 04:21.130
Unless you can pay
all the property taxes

04:21.217 --> 04:26.440
from the last year, plus
a down payment of 200K, then no.

04:26.527 --> 04:27.919
Why the shift?
I thought the Mayor--

04:28.050 --> 04:29.486
They wanna put in
a high-end hideaway

04:29.573 --> 04:31.793
for tourists away from
the slopes. I don't know.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.664
I mean, it's still
speculation right now.

04:33.795 --> 04:35.362
They have to find a buyer
first, but, yeah.

04:35.449 --> 04:37.407
No, no way. This...

04:37.538 --> 04:39.670
This place is practically
a historical landmark.

04:39.801 --> 04:41.019
The entire town of Belleville
knows that.

04:41.106 --> 04:43.065
No one will stand for this.

04:43.152 --> 04:46.024
The board already approved it.

04:46.155 --> 04:48.244
Look, the property is
way too big to not develop

04:48.331 --> 04:51.465
without some sort of
real return. I'm sorry, Ev.

04:51.595 --> 04:53.989
Okay, so we,
I-I don't know, we,

04:54.076 --> 04:55.382
we start up the Christmas
Treasure Hunt again,

04:55.469 --> 04:56.644
like Mrs. Marley used to.

04:56.774 --> 04:58.080
And how are we gonna do that?

04:58.210 --> 04:59.995
Look, even if we did manage

05:00.082 --> 05:01.562
to get the property
up and running,

05:01.649 --> 05:03.477
it-it wouldn't make enough
the year alone

05:03.564 --> 05:05.870
to stop the inevitable.

05:05.957 --> 05:07.481
You said there's no buyer yet, though?

05:09.309 --> 05:11.311
Not that I know of.

05:11.398 --> 05:12.834
But they're putting
Rochelle on it next week

05:12.964 --> 05:14.705
to try to get a listing up
before the holiday.

05:14.792 --> 05:17.491
Good. So it means
we have some time.

05:18.927 --> 05:21.495
You're so stubborn.

05:21.625 --> 05:23.061
A little help here, maybe?

05:23.192 --> 05:25.412
- What? With this?
- Yeah, come on.

05:27.849 --> 05:30.678
- We're doing all this? Ev!
- Yeah. All the way up.

06:11.980 --> 06:13.982
- Ricky?
- Come in.

06:17.333 --> 06:19.553
You received a rather
strange piece of mail.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.076
I think you should have a look.

06:23.905 --> 06:25.385
That's pretty.

06:32.174 --> 06:34.089
- No way.
- You think it's legit?

06:34.219 --> 06:36.134
Yeah, this is Ms. Marley's
handwriting.

06:36.221 --> 06:37.266
I'd know it anywhere
from the hunts

06:37.397 --> 06:39.050
we used to go on
when we were kids.

06:39.137 --> 06:40.748
Yeah, but do you really think

06:40.878 --> 06:42.619
there's buried treasure
on her property?

06:42.706 --> 06:44.142
I thought that was just
town folklore.

06:44.273 --> 06:46.144
Well, that was the idea.

06:46.275 --> 06:48.103
But the only treasure
we ever found

06:48.233 --> 06:50.366
were golden eggs
full of candy, so...

06:52.237 --> 06:54.588
- This came in today's mail?
- Yup.

06:54.718 --> 06:56.764
Right, put in a call
to the paralegal

06:56.894 --> 06:58.243
over at Dawson's Law Firm,
will you?

06:58.374 --> 06:59.810
See if she sent these out today.

06:59.897 --> 07:01.508
Maybe she knows something more
about it.

07:01.595 --> 07:03.161
- Who got 'em, so on.
- You got it.

07:03.292 --> 07:04.598
Okay, thanks.

07:06.121 --> 07:07.905
And so it begins.

07:07.992 --> 07:09.429
You got one, too.

07:09.559 --> 07:10.734
I think we know
who all got these.

07:10.865 --> 07:12.780
You think the whole gang
got one?

07:12.867 --> 07:15.522
I mean, it sounds like something
Ms. Marley would do, right?

07:15.652 --> 07:17.654
Yeah, they won't come.

07:17.741 --> 07:19.177
Michelle and Clay
always fly their parents

07:19.308 --> 07:20.831
to Chicago for the holidays,
and Tipper's family

07:20.918 --> 07:22.616
doesn't even
live here anymore.

07:22.703 --> 07:24.922
Well, maybe they will.
I texted Michelle.

07:25.053 --> 07:26.707
She said she's
working on Clay.

07:26.794 --> 07:29.144
I mean, she even she would
text Tipper too, so...

07:29.274 --> 07:30.450
And Austin?

07:32.800 --> 07:35.019
Doesn't Austin always come home
for the holidays?

07:35.106 --> 07:36.456
Yeah, just because
he comes home, doesn't mean

07:36.586 --> 07:39.154
he's gonna play this game.

07:39.241 --> 07:41.809
Hey, well, if Tipper plays,
Austin will, too.

07:44.159 --> 07:45.987
We haven't seen them
in ages, Ev.

07:46.074 --> 07:48.380
You really think they're gonna
be into this as you are?

07:48.468 --> 07:51.253
I think you need a little more
holiday spirit.

07:51.340 --> 07:52.689
You just wanna
find this treasure

07:52.820 --> 07:54.125
so you can buy out
the property.

07:55.866 --> 07:57.868
So what if I do?

07:57.999 --> 08:01.132
Look, if there was
really treasure there,

08:01.219 --> 08:03.091
you don't think
we would know?

08:03.178 --> 08:05.354
Hey, you've never
seen Santa before

08:05.441 --> 08:06.921
and you still believe in him, right?

08:07.051 --> 08:09.619
Such a bad example.
Come on.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.534
Pam at Dawson's confirmed

08:11.665 --> 08:13.580
it was all detailed
in Ms. Marley's will

08:13.710 --> 08:15.625
that those letters were supposed
to be mailed out

08:15.756 --> 08:18.193
two weeks before Christmas.

08:18.323 --> 08:19.803
- She say anything else?
- Nope.

08:19.890 --> 08:21.762
She just giggled,
and said, "Merry Christmas

08:21.849 --> 08:24.155
and Happy Hunting."

08:24.242 --> 08:27.245
It's cute.
I like the sound of that.

08:27.332 --> 08:28.899
Yup.

08:47.788 --> 08:49.964
- Did you get one of these?
- You got one of those, too?

08:50.094 --> 08:51.835
But Ms. Marley,

08:51.966 --> 08:53.837
I thought you said she passed,
earlier in the spring?

08:53.924 --> 08:56.013
Yes, she did. These must
have been sent posthumously

08:56.144 --> 08:57.798
by a lawyer, maybe?

08:57.885 --> 08:59.060
I mean, she didn't have
any family there.

08:59.190 --> 09:00.931
- She and Chuck never had kids.
- So what?

09:01.062 --> 09:02.803
She just left
some buried treasure behind

09:02.890 --> 09:04.935
for us to come find like
some silly kid's treasure hunt?

09:05.022 --> 09:06.850
- That is the way this reads.
- Wow.

09:06.981 --> 09:09.374
Completely insane
and absurd.

09:09.505 --> 09:11.333
Okay, but maybe not that absurd.

09:11.463 --> 09:13.204
My dad always said
he thought

09:13.291 --> 09:14.205
that she was hiding something
over there.

09:14.336 --> 09:15.816
Yeah, and your dad also said

09:15.903 --> 09:17.208
that if we stared
at the stars long enough,

09:17.339 --> 09:18.732
we'd see UFO's behind them.

09:18.819 --> 09:20.560
He did admit that
that was a ploy

09:20.647 --> 09:22.649
to keep us busy during
summer campouts.

09:22.736 --> 09:24.781
Right, like this letter
is a ploy

09:24.912 --> 09:26.304
to get us back
to a place neither of us

09:26.391 --> 09:27.871
particularly cares to go.

09:27.958 --> 09:31.353
Okay, okay, what if
there really is, like,

09:31.483 --> 09:32.920
a buried treasure out there?

09:33.050 --> 09:34.008
No, no, no.
Just go-go with me.

09:34.138 --> 09:35.792
If there is, and if by chance

09:35.923 --> 09:37.881
we did find it,
it could potentially be

09:38.012 --> 09:39.927
enough money to really start
this partnership properly.

09:40.014 --> 09:41.755
Austin, you can't
really believe that.

09:41.842 --> 09:43.234
That's just some
silly idea we used to

09:43.321 --> 09:44.888
toy around with
when we were kids.

09:44.975 --> 09:46.586
No one is gonna believe that.

09:53.593 --> 09:57.292
- Who was that?
- Um, it's Michelle.

09:57.379 --> 10:00.382
Mm. So maybe I'm not
the only one who believes, huh?

10:00.469 --> 10:02.384
Why don't you answer it?

10:02.514 --> 10:03.341
Right.

10:03.472 --> 10:05.082
But if Michelle believes

10:05.169 --> 10:06.823
and is planning to go home
for the holidays,

10:06.954 --> 10:09.609
don't you think that, uh,
Everett will, too?

10:11.523 --> 10:13.525
No. Everett left
that town years ago.

10:13.656 --> 10:14.744
And he's not going back.

10:14.875 --> 10:16.485
And neither should we!
Okay?

10:16.572 --> 10:18.835
We have a huge New Year's
bash to plan

10:18.922 --> 10:21.055
at least a dozen brands for now, remember?

10:21.185 --> 10:23.057
Not to mention, I'm the one
who has to design it.

10:23.187 --> 10:27.017
Okay, you can design it from
the road and I will drive,

10:27.104 --> 10:29.498
and I promise I will have us
back with plenty of time

10:29.585 --> 10:31.631
to plan everything
before New Year's.

10:31.718 --> 10:33.284
- Austin.
- Tipper.

10:53.130 --> 10:54.523
Morning, Rochelle.
How are you?

10:54.654 --> 10:56.830
Oh, amazing.

10:56.960 --> 11:01.182
Just getting ready for
my greatest sale yet. And you?

11:01.269 --> 11:03.967
Just getting ready to be
your greatest buyer yet.

11:05.708 --> 11:09.843
- You think?
- I do. Yeah, and-and in fact...

11:13.847 --> 11:16.806
Just a little taste of
what's coming.

11:16.937 --> 11:18.852
Big butterscotch candy cane?

11:18.982 --> 11:20.592
Well,
to the untrained eye.

11:20.723 --> 11:23.465
But to those who believe in
Christmas miracles,

11:23.595 --> 11:24.858
that's pure gold.

11:31.516 --> 11:33.431
Mm, okay.

11:33.518 --> 11:34.824
Bye.

12:06.900 --> 12:09.076
Ooh.

12:09.206 --> 12:11.121
You remember when we used to do
those treasure hunts out here?

12:11.252 --> 12:13.080
I mean, we weren't even
together back then.

12:13.210 --> 12:14.908
I'm not even sure
you even liked me.

12:14.995 --> 12:17.606
I still don't like you.

12:17.693 --> 12:20.870
I know.

12:21.001 --> 12:23.133
Oh, it is really strange
to be back here.

12:23.264 --> 12:25.875
But, we are doing this
for Everett, right?

12:26.006 --> 12:29.270
He needs some closure. He was
really close to Ms. Marley.

12:29.357 --> 12:31.663
- Yeah.
- It must be really hard for him.

12:31.794 --> 12:33.535
That, and the buried treasure.

12:33.622 --> 12:35.929
Okay. Like we need the money.

12:36.016 --> 12:37.495
I mean, we will
if you keep spending

12:37.626 --> 12:38.670
all that money on those shoes.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.412
Uh-uh! You promised.

12:41.499 --> 12:43.066
And you promised that we'd get
something to eat back there,

12:43.197 --> 12:44.328
but that was a lie.

12:44.415 --> 12:45.852
A what?

12:45.939 --> 12:46.809
I just don't
want us running into

12:46.896 --> 12:48.332
our parents yet.

12:48.419 --> 12:51.031
We have business to
attend to.

12:51.161 --> 12:53.337
So are we meeting up
with everyone tonight?

12:53.468 --> 12:57.385
Mm-hmm.
Yup. In town at the tavern.

12:57.472 --> 12:59.474
Does Austin know that
Everett is back in town?

12:59.561 --> 13:00.736
I don't know.

13:00.867 --> 13:02.042
But the joy of the prospect

13:02.172 --> 13:03.783
is not lost on my holiday cheer.

13:19.886 --> 13:21.278
So the cupcake company
wants to

13:21.365 --> 13:22.802
push with the
peppermint special,

13:22.932 --> 13:24.064
but that feels
too Christmassy

13:24.151 --> 13:25.152
for a New Year's Eve Party.

13:25.282 --> 13:26.414
What do you think of these?

13:26.501 --> 13:27.807
Chocolate cupcakes

13:27.937 --> 13:29.373
with glittery New Year's hats?

13:29.460 --> 13:31.027
Yes.
But do they make those?

13:31.114 --> 13:33.551
No, but once they see
my design

13:33.638 --> 13:35.815
and our influencer line-up,
they will.

13:37.512 --> 13:40.167
Look. There it is.

13:40.254 --> 13:43.474
Wow. This really
brings back memories.

13:43.561 --> 13:44.780
Do you really think
it could be there?

13:44.911 --> 13:47.130
This so-called
buried treasure?

13:47.217 --> 13:49.002
Who knows? Maybe.

13:49.089 --> 13:51.569
But if not, it'll be a fun trip
down memory lane, huh?

13:51.656 --> 13:53.615
Did you know
this was up for sale?

13:53.702 --> 13:55.486
Nope. Sure didn't.

13:55.573 --> 13:57.184
- Mm.
- Mm.

14:05.322 --> 14:07.020
Ah, there they are!

14:07.107 --> 14:08.456
Hi, mom. Hi, dad.

14:08.543 --> 14:11.024
Merry Christmas, son!

14:11.111 --> 14:13.635
And, Tipper!
Ah, what has it been, like,

14:13.722 --> 14:15.985
four years since
we visited LA?

14:16.072 --> 14:17.944
Totally.
Merry Christmas, you guys.

14:18.031 --> 14:20.772
- So good to see you, son.
- You too.

14:20.903 --> 14:23.993
Ah, so, if you're
my little Tipper...

14:24.080 --> 14:27.388
- Then you must be Chipper.
- Oh, my God.

14:27.475 --> 14:31.000
All these years later, dear,
and it's still not funny.

14:31.087 --> 14:33.873
So, we hear
you are home for a hunt!

14:34.003 --> 14:36.876
Ah, news travels fast.
How'd you know?

14:36.963 --> 14:38.660
You know I didn't tell you
on purpose.

14:38.747 --> 14:40.488
Aww. What'd you think we'd do?
Spoil the fun?

14:40.575 --> 14:42.707
No, I just thought
you might kinda make fun.

14:42.794 --> 14:44.579
Make fun?
We would never, son!

14:44.666 --> 14:46.102
You did when we were kids.

14:46.233 --> 14:47.930
Oh, we were just having fun
with you kids.

14:48.017 --> 14:50.454
If the treasure is there,
then it's real.

14:50.541 --> 14:52.369
Not to mention,
you're adults now,

14:52.500 --> 14:54.894
so this will be a mature--

14:54.981 --> 14:57.244
You know what, I'm not gonna
do this with you guys right now.

14:57.331 --> 14:59.289
Why don't you help with our bags
so we can get settled in.

14:59.420 --> 15:01.291
- Of course.
- Thank you so much.

15:01.378 --> 15:04.077
So, Tipper,
are you seeing anyone?

15:04.207 --> 15:06.253
Nope.
I am as free as a bird.

15:06.383 --> 15:08.255
And what about our son?
Is he?

15:08.342 --> 15:11.475
Wow. Just like that,
I need a drink.

15:11.562 --> 15:13.042
You wanna text Michelle, see if
the gang's willing to meet up?

15:13.129 --> 15:14.478
Sure.

15:14.609 --> 15:16.393
I'm guessing
this is Sans parents.

15:16.524 --> 15:19.222
You nailed it.

15:19.309 --> 15:21.703
And that was all your fault, honey.

15:21.790 --> 15:23.618
Aw, I missed you guys.

15:25.315 --> 15:28.275
And by the way,
he's single, Chip.

15:28.405 --> 15:30.233
Tipper!
Sorry.

15:39.764 --> 15:42.680
Oh, look! They're here.

15:42.767 --> 15:44.726
Everett's here. Mm-hmm.

15:44.813 --> 15:46.162
You knew about this,
didn't you?

15:46.293 --> 15:47.250
Michelle told you
when you talked to her.

15:47.337 --> 15:48.686
Yup.

15:48.817 --> 15:49.774
And that's why
you agreed to come.

15:49.905 --> 15:51.646
- Because of him.
- Absolutely.

15:51.733 --> 15:53.735
- I hate you.
- Hi!

15:53.865 --> 15:56.781
Hi! Oh, my goodness!
I'm so happy to see you guys!

15:56.868 --> 15:58.435
- It's just been forever!
- Forever.

15:58.566 --> 16:01.569
And you two, just what,
you don't age? That's not fair.

16:01.699 --> 16:03.223
Yeah, well, these legs aren't
what they used to be.

16:03.310 --> 16:04.920
Well, you are still a star!

16:05.007 --> 16:06.878
We love watching your games
every season.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.142
Ah, thank you. You guys should
really come to Chicago.

16:09.272 --> 16:10.621
We'll get you guys
center seats.

16:10.708 --> 16:12.319
- Best seats on the court.
- Yes!

16:12.449 --> 16:13.798
And how's our publicist doing?

16:13.885 --> 16:16.018
Well, I rep half the guys
on his team now.

16:16.105 --> 16:18.064
So, now you know
why we don't have any children.

16:18.194 --> 16:19.935
I have so many.

16:20.022 --> 16:22.503
And wow, Everett, you're here!

16:22.633 --> 16:25.201
Yeah. I've been back for
a year or so now.

16:25.288 --> 16:27.377
- You didn't know?
- No. No.

16:27.464 --> 16:29.292
That's news to me.

16:29.379 --> 16:31.207
All right. Okay, then.

16:31.338 --> 16:33.731
Everett has apparently
been fixing up

16:33.818 --> 16:35.168
Ms. Marley's place
the past year.

16:35.298 --> 16:37.039
Surprised
he hasn't already found

16:37.126 --> 16:39.824
our hidden treasure,
unless he has,

16:39.955 --> 16:43.176
and all of this is just a ploy
to get us home for Christmas.

16:43.263 --> 16:44.916
How much are our
parents really paying?

16:45.004 --> 16:47.049
No, no, no, no,
I mean, Ricky and I were

16:47.180 --> 16:48.572
just as surprised
as the rest of you.

16:48.659 --> 16:51.314
Wait. Ricky Trevino?
Is he here, too?

16:51.401 --> 16:54.535
No, actually. Ricky's not really
buying this whole thing, so...

16:54.622 --> 16:56.537
But wait,
the letter said that

16:56.624 --> 16:58.234
we all had to be here for this.

16:58.365 --> 16:59.801
Yeah, well, try
telling Ricky that.

16:59.888 --> 17:01.977
You know, he-he works for
city planning now,

17:02.064 --> 17:04.066
and they're trying to sell
the property.

17:04.197 --> 17:06.025
He's in a bit of pickle,
I guess.

17:06.112 --> 17:07.591
Yeah, I know,
we saw the "For Sale" sign.

17:07.678 --> 17:09.158
It's-it's too bad, really.

17:09.289 --> 17:10.855
Yeah, well, they won't have the
chance to sell

17:10.986 --> 17:12.466
if I have anything to say about.

17:12.553 --> 17:13.858
And what do you
have to say about it?

17:13.989 --> 17:15.034
Well, when we find the treasure,

17:15.121 --> 17:16.731
I'm, I'm buying the place.

17:16.818 --> 17:18.211
I'm gonna, I'm gonna fix it up,

17:18.298 --> 17:20.952
turn it into a bed and breakfast
or something.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.477
Maybe even revive the Hunt.

17:23.607 --> 17:26.654
Do-do my parents happen to know
about some of this?

17:26.784 --> 17:28.743
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
I see 'em all the time.

17:30.745 --> 17:33.313
Okay! Ah, hey,
who wants a drink?

17:33.400 --> 17:34.792
- I do!
- I do. You know what?

17:34.923 --> 17:36.316
I got yours.
I owe you for driving.

17:36.403 --> 17:37.534
I will get us a couple of cabs.

17:37.621 --> 17:39.058
Oh, my God.

17:47.196 --> 17:48.937
So how are things?
How are you?

17:49.024 --> 17:51.853
Great! Thanks. Never better.
Fantastic, actually.

17:51.983 --> 17:53.985
Tipper and I, we-we started
our own business.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.900
Social media
branding and strategies.

17:56.031 --> 17:58.033
Um, so it's going quite well.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.904
Booming, actually.
I'm very happy.

17:59.991 --> 18:01.341
You didn't know
I was gonna be here.

18:01.428 --> 18:02.603
No, no one disclosed
that to me.

18:04.909 --> 18:08.826
Well, now that you know, can we
at least just talk, be civil?

18:08.957 --> 18:10.611
You know, I mean,
I tried to call you,

18:10.698 --> 18:12.395
like, quite a few times
if I recall.

18:12.482 --> 18:14.571
- Ah, when was that?
- Like forever ago.

18:14.658 --> 18:16.617
You know, like,
the summer after I left?

18:16.704 --> 18:18.009
And then a bunch of times
after that.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.315
I mean, I finally gave up

18:19.402 --> 18:20.621
because you never
called me back.

18:20.708 --> 18:22.449
Oh, but that's it, isn't it?

18:22.579 --> 18:24.581
That is what I remember best.

18:24.668 --> 18:26.496
You gave up.

18:26.627 --> 18:28.629
Ouch, Austin.

18:28.759 --> 18:30.413
You don't have to be like that.
You know I didn't wanna leave.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.459
It's not that you left, Everett.

18:32.546 --> 18:35.114
- It's how you left.
- Okay.

18:37.203 --> 18:39.640
Um. You know wine's
not meant to be chugged, right?

18:39.770 --> 18:41.468
All right,
so the treasure hunt?

18:41.555 --> 18:43.557
Start tomorrow?
Get it over with and off we go?

18:43.687 --> 18:45.515
Yeah, well, it's gonna be
hard to locate the map

18:45.602 --> 18:46.734
Ms. Marley claims
is hidden in the house

18:46.821 --> 18:48.692
'cause we don't have the keys.

18:48.823 --> 18:50.825
- Who has the keys?
- Ricky has 'em.

18:50.912 --> 18:53.567
- Down at City Hall.
- Oh.

18:53.697 --> 18:58.093
Well, then, maybe somebody
should go pay him a visit.

18:58.180 --> 19:00.313
Somebody who maybe still has
a way with him?

19:05.274 --> 19:09.322
Okay, then. Yeah, no, I can,
I can definitely do that.

19:09.452 --> 19:11.541
Great! Cheers, then.

19:11.672 --> 19:15.676
To the last Treasure Hunt.
One to remember!

19:15.763 --> 19:17.286
Remember.
Cheers.

19:35.913 --> 19:38.394
So, how was catching up
with the gang?

19:38.525 --> 19:40.831
You didn't tell me
that Everett moved home.

19:40.918 --> 19:43.530
Would you have come home
to do this if I had?

19:44.835 --> 19:46.533
Touche.

19:46.620 --> 19:50.450
It was surreal to say the least,
having the entire gang

19:50.537 --> 19:52.539
back in the same place
after all these years.

19:52.626 --> 19:55.324
I bet, but you'll all fall back
into it again, I'm sure.

19:57.500 --> 20:00.895
Either way, honey, I'm just
so glad you're home.

20:00.982 --> 20:03.114
It's good to be home, mom.

20:24.658 --> 20:27.226
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:27.313 --> 20:29.358
- Miss, you can't go in there--
- Ricky, hi!

20:29.445 --> 20:32.056
Merry Christmas.
It's so good to see you.

20:32.143 --> 20:33.971
- Tipper?
- I tried to stop her--

20:34.102 --> 20:36.278
It's fine, Jeannie.
She's an old friend.

20:36.409 --> 20:37.758
Oh.

20:40.021 --> 20:42.458
So, how are things with you?

20:42.545 --> 20:45.809
Um, I'm good, I guess.

20:45.896 --> 20:47.768
- I'm surprised you're here.
- Why is that?

20:47.855 --> 20:49.770
Well, as I recall,
at graduation

20:49.857 --> 20:51.772
you said you'd never step
foot in this town again

20:51.902 --> 20:53.208
unless you were in a casket.

20:53.295 --> 20:54.688
Ah, yes.

20:54.775 --> 20:55.863
Then you proceeded to inform me

20:55.950 --> 20:57.299
that if I were in a casket,

20:57.430 --> 20:59.127
I wouldn't be stepping
foot anywhere.

20:59.214 --> 21:00.215
- Mm-hmm.
- You were always so funny.

21:00.302 --> 21:02.043
- You think so?
- Not really.

21:02.130 --> 21:03.479
- Oh.
- But you look good!

21:03.610 --> 21:05.394
Honestly.
I mean, you filled out some.

21:05.481 --> 21:08.615
Thanks. Yeah, no, I go to
the gym a few times a week now.

21:08.745 --> 21:11.400
- Do you? Well good! Good.
- Yeah.

21:11.531 --> 21:12.967
Because we're gonna need
those muscles to dig up

21:13.054 --> 21:15.274
this undiscovered treasure.

21:15.361 --> 21:16.797
Yeah, I thought
you might say that.

21:16.884 --> 21:21.802
Um, look, sadly, uh,
I can't participate, so--

21:21.932 --> 21:23.717
And, uh, that's what I heard.

21:23.847 --> 21:26.154
That's really too bad, you know,
because apparently all of us

21:26.285 --> 21:27.851
need to be there
to make this thing happen

21:27.938 --> 21:29.940
and, you know,
it's just gonna be

21:30.027 --> 21:32.291
that much harder
to find this thing now.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.815
- Yeah.
- It's a little selfish, Ricky.

21:34.902 --> 21:38.427
I-I-I don't mean to be.
You know, it's, it's my job.

21:38.514 --> 21:41.517
Mm. Can I ask you a question,
Ricky?

21:41.604 --> 21:43.302
Do you love your job?

21:43.389 --> 21:47.480
Uh. I don't know. Sometimes?

21:48.959 --> 21:50.309
Mm.

21:54.791 --> 21:56.489
Ricky, do you still have trouble

21:56.576 --> 21:58.186
seeing without
those reading glasses?

21:58.273 --> 22:00.667
- Ah, yeah.
- Okay.

22:00.754 --> 22:02.016
Well, I'm gonna need you
to take them off

22:02.146 --> 22:03.060
in the event
you're gonna wanna pretend

22:03.147 --> 22:04.148
you didn't see this.

22:05.846 --> 22:07.369
Now, you can't take that.
Those are my...

22:07.500 --> 22:09.023
Tipper! Those are the keys
that I...

22:09.110 --> 22:11.112
Tipper, don't.
Tipper!

22:11.242 --> 22:12.287
Okay, that's cool.

22:12.374 --> 22:14.724
You said she was your friend.

22:14.855 --> 22:17.336
Thank you, Jeannie.
That's awesome.

22:20.774 --> 22:22.297
- You got them!
- I got them.

22:22.384 --> 22:23.603
I knew you would.

22:23.690 --> 22:25.561
Some things never change.

22:25.692 --> 22:26.867
Hope you didn't leave Ricky
high and dry

22:26.954 --> 22:28.434
in a pool of his own tears.

22:28.564 --> 22:29.913
You know, he actually
looked really good.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.002
He finally grew
into his head, you know?

22:32.089 --> 22:34.918
- Oh, Tipper.
- Sorry.

22:35.005 --> 22:37.225
So are we doing this thing
or what?

22:37.312 --> 22:39.314
- Stop!
- Come on.

22:39.445 --> 22:40.924
- Stop!
- Go! Go, go, go.

22:41.011 --> 22:43.666
No. Do-do not go in there.

22:43.797 --> 22:44.928
I'm a city official, okay?

22:45.015 --> 22:46.365
You can't be in there.

22:48.454 --> 22:52.022
No, guys, come on.
Come on. Guys! Okay.

22:52.153 --> 22:54.851
Okay, just don't go through the,
don't go through the door!

23:03.164 --> 23:06.602
Guys, okay. No, guys,
you-you cannot be in here.

23:06.689 --> 23:09.126
- This is trespassing.
- You're with the city, right?

23:09.213 --> 23:11.085
And the city owns the property
for the time being?

23:11.172 --> 23:13.870
So, no, not really.

23:13.957 --> 23:16.133
- No...
- Oh, come on, Ricky.

23:16.220 --> 23:17.483
Aren't you even
just a little curious

23:17.570 --> 23:19.180
to see what this is all about?

23:19.310 --> 23:21.095
At the very least,
spend time with old friends?

23:21.225 --> 23:22.749
Yeah.

23:28.798 --> 23:33.499
Fine. We find the map.
Then out. Okay?

23:33.586 --> 23:36.153
Man, this place
hasn't changed a bit, has it?

23:36.240 --> 23:40.462
It really hasn't. Who put up
the Christmas decorations?

23:40.549 --> 23:43.552
- I did, a while ago.
- You-you did?

23:43.683 --> 23:45.554
How did you get in here?
You didn't even have the key?

23:45.685 --> 23:49.166
Well, had a set of keys
before the City took them.

23:49.253 --> 23:50.820
I was here with Ms. Marley
the last few months

23:50.907 --> 23:52.561
before she passed.

23:52.692 --> 23:54.650
- You were?
- Yeah.

23:54.781 --> 23:56.391
Wait, and she never
said anything to you

23:56.522 --> 23:58.785
about her little treasure?

23:58.872 --> 24:00.961
- No.
- Mm.

24:01.091 --> 24:03.442
Okay, so, where do we start?

24:05.705 --> 24:07.402
You know, maybe there's a clue
in the letter.

24:07.533 --> 24:08.969
- Oh, right.
- Right.

24:10.971 --> 24:12.712
Mm.

24:12.799 --> 24:15.192
"Six young children
once changed my life.

24:15.323 --> 24:18.369
Kept my house a home
when my husband died."

24:18.457 --> 24:21.503
"Now it is with you six kids
I leave what we owned.

24:21.590 --> 24:24.463
And six keys you must find,
now that you're grown."

24:24.550 --> 24:26.813
"Listen to one another's
hearts again,

24:26.943 --> 24:29.555
and follow me
in merry measure."

24:29.642 --> 24:32.209
"As you bundle up like
the snow-covered bison,

24:32.296 --> 24:36.736
and let my map lead you
to a buried treasure."

24:36.823 --> 24:39.782
Cryptic. I got nothing. You?

24:43.046 --> 24:44.744
Maybe we start
in the sunroom?

24:44.831 --> 24:46.223
That's where we used to hang out

24:46.354 --> 24:48.704
whenever we were over here, usually.

24:48.835 --> 24:51.098
- Okay, Ricky.
- No, not okay, Ricky.

24:51.185 --> 24:53.013
- Let's just go home.
- No.

24:53.143 --> 24:54.841
Find this thing and let's go.

24:59.236 --> 25:02.501
This is incredible.

25:02.588 --> 25:04.067
I can't believe
these are even still here!

25:04.198 --> 25:05.895
Do you guys remember
when old Mr. Marley

25:05.982 --> 25:08.594
used to read us <i>Peter Pan</i>
right here?

25:08.681 --> 25:11.727
Yes, and then we'd go outside
and reenact it.

25:11.858 --> 25:13.555
You, you were,
you were always Tinkerbell.

25:13.686 --> 25:15.992
Mm-hmm, and Tipper was
always Wendy,

25:16.079 --> 25:20.910
and Austin and Clay took turns
being Peter and the Lost Boy,

25:20.997 --> 25:25.959
and Ricky, you were always
Captain Hooks' best pirate.

25:26.046 --> 25:28.178
Well, honestly sometimes
I wanted to play Hook,

25:28.265 --> 25:30.529
but Everett was just so
good at being the villain.

25:30.616 --> 25:34.315
Everett, villain. That tracks.

25:46.240 --> 25:50.070
Wow. I forgot about
this very green kitchen.

25:50.157 --> 25:51.854
Was it always this green?

25:51.941 --> 25:53.682
We called it the Emerald City

25:53.813 --> 25:56.511
and we used to pretended that
we were visiting Oz.

25:56.598 --> 25:58.948
You called it that.
And I called you nutty.

25:59.035 --> 26:00.646
I think you called me imaginative.

26:00.733 --> 26:02.082
Adorable.

26:02.169 --> 26:03.605
So where might this map be?

26:03.692 --> 26:05.085
This house is-is huge.
Where do we start?

26:05.215 --> 26:06.869
How about
we split up?

26:07.000 --> 26:08.784
A few of us take the upstairs,
a few of us stay down?

26:08.915 --> 26:10.656
Yeah, okay.
Ricky and I can try upstairs.

26:10.743 --> 26:12.962
In which case, we'll stay here.

26:13.049 --> 26:14.834
And we'll check
around out back.

26:14.921 --> 26:17.576
You are unbelievable

26:20.970 --> 26:22.885
Okay. Where to?

26:26.280 --> 26:28.325
Just one shot.

26:28.456 --> 26:29.936
Come on, this was the court
that made me.

26:32.242 --> 26:33.592
Okay.

26:35.419 --> 26:36.769
Are you gonna act
like a child with him

26:36.899 --> 26:38.509
the entire time we're here?

26:38.597 --> 26:40.207
Oh, because it was
so adult of you

26:40.337 --> 26:42.122
to not even tell me
that he was gonna be here.

26:42.209 --> 26:44.515
Austin, at some point
you need to talk to him.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.169
I mean, he clearly feels bad

26:46.256 --> 26:47.649
about the way you two
left things.

26:47.736 --> 26:49.346
Things weren't left
any way.

26:49.477 --> 26:51.044
Everett and I were
never together.

26:51.174 --> 26:54.177
We kissed once, like,
junior year. Then he moved home.

26:54.264 --> 26:57.093
- So there was nothing to leave.
- He broke your heart.

26:57.180 --> 26:59.661
We both know that.
And now he knows it, too.

26:59.748 --> 27:02.446
I mean, maybe he's just
trying to make things right.

27:02.533 --> 27:04.753
- And maybe I just wanna move on.
- Great.

27:04.884 --> 27:06.755
Maybe talking to him
will finally help you do that.

27:06.842 --> 27:08.148
Oh. Wait, what was that?

27:08.278 --> 27:10.933
Oh, look at that,
I've moved on.

27:11.020 --> 27:15.242
Please! You check his social
media at least once a week.

27:15.372 --> 27:17.984
We share a social
business account, remember?

27:18.114 --> 27:20.247
The names of the profiles
you viewed, they pop right up.

27:20.334 --> 27:21.683
You know, if I had
some red heels right now,

27:21.814 --> 27:23.467
I'd click them
and I'd send you home.

27:23.554 --> 27:24.947
Mm, well, don't stop there.

27:25.034 --> 27:26.732
Why not just drop
an entire house on me?

27:26.862 --> 27:28.821
Don't tempt me.

27:28.951 --> 27:31.171
Nothing in the bedrooms.

27:31.301 --> 27:33.869
Let's try the old play room.

27:34.000 --> 27:34.957
Yeah.

27:52.975 --> 27:54.150
Snow-covered bison.

27:57.850 --> 27:58.981
No way.

28:03.899 --> 28:05.379
Guys, we found it.

28:11.167 --> 28:12.908
Whoo!

28:12.995 --> 28:14.214
Hurry up!

28:14.301 --> 28:16.825
Clay. Clay, run!

28:20.220 --> 28:22.570
We're up
in the old play room. Come on.

28:23.702 --> 28:24.877
Come on.

28:27.357 --> 28:28.619
Where was it?

28:28.707 --> 28:31.448
It was behind the bison painting.

28:31.535 --> 28:33.929
Okay, but the X looks like it's
here on the property already,

28:34.016 --> 28:35.061
so what are these
other X points?

28:35.191 --> 28:36.889
Maybe the six key locations?

28:37.019 --> 28:39.805
- Six keys to what?
- Who knows?

28:39.892 --> 28:42.459
But maybe the final key will
tell us where the treasure is.

28:42.590 --> 28:46.202
And maybe the first key is,
I don't know, here?

28:46.289 --> 28:48.683
So it's a key map.
Not a treasure map.

28:48.770 --> 28:50.206
Look, for all we know,

28:50.293 --> 28:51.947
the actual treasure
might be at the bank.

28:52.078 --> 28:54.080
Maybe the keys are to
safety deposit box.

28:54.167 --> 28:55.908
No, that doesn't really
sound like Mrs. Marley.

28:55.995 --> 28:58.432
He's right. She was all about
Christmas magic.

28:58.562 --> 28:59.738
If there's a real treasure here,

28:59.825 --> 29:01.652
it is definitely buried
on the property.

29:01.783 --> 29:04.133
Well, maybe it's buried
behind the house,

29:04.220 --> 29:05.961
maybe that's what
this X here is.

29:06.048 --> 29:07.876
Maybe it's the start
and the finish of the hunt?

29:07.963 --> 29:08.964
What do you guys
think about this?

29:09.051 --> 29:10.923
Maybe the helicopter wings

29:11.010 --> 29:14.404
aren't just wings, but what if
this is the first X?

29:14.491 --> 29:17.799
Mm. Clay.

29:17.886 --> 29:20.759
- Yeah, that could work.
- Okay.

29:20.846 --> 29:21.629
Wow.

29:26.373 --> 29:28.767
The helicopter
doesn't have any wings.

29:28.897 --> 29:31.770
And I thought you were the one
with the imagination.

29:31.900 --> 29:33.902
Aw, man, Clay, I remember
when you used to

29:33.989 --> 29:37.645
pretend to fly us everywhere.

29:37.732 --> 29:39.952
- So where are we going? Bali?
- Mm-hmm.

29:40.039 --> 29:41.823
I don't see anything
on this side, guys.

29:41.910 --> 29:42.998
Wait, does this thing
open up back here?

29:43.085 --> 29:45.653
Who knows? Let's find out.

29:47.089 --> 29:49.657
- What?
- Whoo. Oh, my gosh.

29:51.528 --> 29:53.617
You guys,
there's a key in here!

29:53.704 --> 29:54.967
There's one in here, too.

29:55.054 --> 29:57.970
- There's keys in all of them.
- What?

29:58.100 --> 29:59.536
Do any of these
mean anything to anyone?

29:59.667 --> 30:00.973
Unh-unh.

30:01.060 --> 30:02.278
Hey,
that's my jersey number

30:02.365 --> 30:03.932
from high school.

30:04.019 --> 30:05.804
And in our high school colors.

30:05.891 --> 30:07.153
- What?
- Fitting, right?

30:07.283 --> 30:09.372
I mean, you always did
wanna fly.

30:09.503 --> 30:11.592
Thank you, Ms. Marley.

30:11.722 --> 30:13.420
One down. Five more to go.

30:13.550 --> 30:15.509
- Yay!
- Wow.

30:17.467 --> 30:19.687
So if Clay's key was here,

30:19.774 --> 30:21.080
then it looks like the next
closest key

30:21.167 --> 30:23.604
would be due north-east,
somewhere around here.

30:23.691 --> 30:25.736
Okay, but that is definitely
past the fence line.

30:25.867 --> 30:28.348
- Right. So--
- That's the old wine cellar.

30:28.478 --> 30:31.133
The one that my dad helped
the Marley's build.

30:31.264 --> 30:33.179
But it's gonna be dark
by the time we get out there.

30:33.309 --> 30:34.615
Well, then we better
get a move on.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.533
You're way too into this.

30:56.898 --> 30:58.552
Okay.

30:58.682 --> 31:01.207
Um, who put up Christmas lights?

31:01.294 --> 31:02.643
I did, last week.

31:02.773 --> 31:04.210
I wanted to give
the Marley place

31:04.297 --> 31:06.777
some of its old Christmas spirit
one more time

31:06.865 --> 31:08.954
just in case
it was the last time.

31:09.084 --> 31:10.520
Aww, it's so cute.

31:10.607 --> 31:11.826
It looks just like it used to

31:11.957 --> 31:13.828
when we'd come here as kids.

31:13.915 --> 31:16.483
Yeah, but speaking of, how did
Ms. Marley get around here

31:16.613 --> 31:18.746
to hide all these keys?

31:18.833 --> 31:21.183
She-she couldn't have done it
all on her own in her condition.

31:21.314 --> 31:24.056
Well, I've got
a sneaking suspicion.

31:24.143 --> 31:26.972
Hey, don't look at me.
I had no clue.

31:27.102 --> 31:29.844
And i-if I had, I would've
already unearthed

31:29.931 --> 31:31.411
this so-called treasure
and made a down payment

31:31.498 --> 31:33.195
on this property, so...

31:33.282 --> 31:34.631
Sorry.
I'm can't go in.

31:34.762 --> 31:36.895
You know, spiders.

31:36.982 --> 31:38.679
Arachnophobia
is a very real thing.

31:38.766 --> 31:41.900
Oh, we'll help you.
Right, guys?

31:41.987 --> 31:43.858
Uh, I'm technically
not supposed to be here,

31:43.989 --> 31:47.383
so I'm just gonna... stay here.

31:47.514 --> 31:49.342
Let's do this thing.

31:57.089 --> 31:59.787
It's just a bunch
of bottles of old wine.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.702
Maybe some of 'em
have value now.

32:01.789 --> 32:03.269
It's doubtful.

32:03.399 --> 32:05.010
My dad used to stock this
for them.

32:05.097 --> 32:07.012
And you know how cheap
he can be.

32:07.099 --> 32:08.927
Speaking of,
don't we have dinner

32:09.057 --> 32:10.232
with your parents tonight?

32:10.363 --> 32:13.496
We do.
Someone send help.

32:13.583 --> 32:15.542
And wine.

32:15.629 --> 32:17.283
Whoo, it's getting chilly.

32:17.370 --> 32:20.286
Could really go for
some hot cider right about now.

32:20.416 --> 32:22.288
Oh, well.

32:22.375 --> 32:24.420
Oh. There's keys in these.
There's no ribbons on them.

32:24.507 --> 32:26.727
So how do we know
which one is mine?

32:26.857 --> 32:28.729
- Um...
- Um, wait, the corks.

32:28.816 --> 32:32.515
They're different wine brands.
Okay, so, hold on.

32:32.602 --> 32:34.735
Maybe you should, um,
come to dinner tonight.

32:34.822 --> 32:37.346
My dad makes
a piping hot cider.

32:37.433 --> 32:39.435
Oh, yeah?

32:39.566 --> 32:41.698
Oh! It's this one!

32:41.785 --> 32:43.004
This is the wine
from our wedding.

32:43.135 --> 32:44.484
She kept it.

32:48.401 --> 32:51.621
This is it. We sent a thank you
bottle to Ms. Marley.

32:51.752 --> 32:53.841
A bottle of Cameron Hughes!

32:56.017 --> 32:58.672
- This is incredible.
- Aw, our wedding.

32:58.759 --> 33:00.935
Hey, so speaking of,
I'm, I-I've been wanting to say

33:01.022 --> 33:03.198
that I'm so sorry for missing
your wedding.

33:03.285 --> 33:05.635
I just, uh...

33:05.766 --> 33:06.985
Yeah, I-I wasn't ready
to come to terms

33:07.072 --> 33:07.986
with some things back then.

33:08.073 --> 33:10.423
Look, we totally understood.

33:10.510 --> 33:12.381
You were going through a lot
during that time.

33:12.512 --> 33:14.035
Thank you.

33:14.122 --> 33:15.906
Plus,
what truly matters is that

33:15.994 --> 33:17.473
you still sent
a really great gift.

33:20.085 --> 33:22.783
- We found it!
- What? Really? Where?

33:22.870 --> 33:24.306
There were all
these bottles with keys in them.

33:24.437 --> 33:25.873
But we knew it was mine

33:26.004 --> 33:27.657
because this is the wine
from our wedding.

33:27.788 --> 33:29.224
- Aww. That's cute.
- Aww.

33:29.355 --> 33:32.140
Okay, well, can we go now?
It's getting dark.

33:32.227 --> 33:33.750
And we should call it a night
on this hunt.

33:33.881 --> 33:35.187
Yeah. Let's get back
before we all freeze.

33:35.274 --> 33:36.753
We'll try again tomorrow.

33:36.884 --> 33:38.755
Oh, by the way, Ev,
I know Michelle and Clay

33:38.842 --> 33:40.670
are gonna meet up with
Michelle's parents later,

33:40.757 --> 33:42.933
but Ricky is actually coming
to the house,

33:43.021 --> 33:45.240
so I don't know
if you have dinner plans yet.

33:45.371 --> 33:48.243
- But...
- Yeah, that'd be great.

33:48.330 --> 33:51.159
- Oh, yay! Come on.
- It's great.

33:51.246 --> 33:52.465
Yeah.

33:58.384 --> 34:00.516
So you say, you kids
have already found

34:00.647 --> 34:02.127
two of these mystery keys

34:02.257 --> 34:04.346
that Ms. Marley left behind
for you to find?

34:04.477 --> 34:07.349
Yes. And hopefully tomorrow
morning, we can find the rest.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.177
Oh, ho, ho, no.

34:09.308 --> 34:11.440
No, you're coming downtown
with me tomorrow, Austin.

34:11.571 --> 34:13.007
What? Why?

34:13.138 --> 34:15.575
We're doing the
Jackets for Juniors.

34:15.662 --> 34:17.142
We do it every year.
Did you forget?

34:17.272 --> 34:18.795
Yes, no, that's right.

34:18.926 --> 34:20.754
Well, then, maybe we can take
the afternoon

34:20.884 --> 34:22.582
and look for the rest of 'em.

34:22.669 --> 34:25.585
Honey! It's our annual
holiday game night.

34:25.672 --> 34:29.197
I've already ordered the pizzas
and the pies and...

34:29.328 --> 34:31.243
Oh, gosh, I was really hoping
everybody could come.

34:31.373 --> 34:34.681
Ooh, you had me
at pizza and pies.

34:34.768 --> 34:37.031
What? I gotta eat
tons of calories.

34:37.162 --> 34:39.686
I work out now, you know.

34:39.773 --> 34:43.298
He does. I see him
and Everett there all the time.

34:43.385 --> 34:45.909
We even spot each other.
Right, guys?

34:45.996 --> 34:49.174
- Yeah.
- Oh, well, um...

34:49.304 --> 34:51.654
Okay, well, maybe we can make it
to the game night,

34:51.785 --> 34:53.743
and if you guys
can find the time tomorrow,

34:53.830 --> 34:55.267
we find the rest of the keys.

34:55.397 --> 34:56.833
Well, actually, I already
told your dad

34:56.964 --> 34:58.531
that I would help him
for the coat drive.

34:58.618 --> 34:59.880
I mean,
I hope that's still okay?

35:00.010 --> 35:02.796
- Of course, son!
- This, uh, ahem.

35:02.883 --> 35:05.799
Son? No! No, no.
You can't call him that.

35:05.929 --> 35:07.975
'Cause he's not your son.
I'm your son.

35:08.062 --> 35:09.672
We practically raised him.

35:09.803 --> 35:11.892
He was here almost every day
after school.

35:12.022 --> 35:15.200
You kids had sleepovers
almost every weekend growing up.

35:15.330 --> 35:16.853
That's right!

35:16.984 --> 35:19.639
You kids, man, you really had it
made out here.

35:19.769 --> 35:22.772
Between the basketball court
and the clubhouse,

35:22.903 --> 35:25.819
I'm surprised any of you
ever even went any place else.

35:25.906 --> 35:27.647
It is great, you know,
this-this treasure hunt,

35:27.777 --> 35:29.301
the more I think about it.

35:29.431 --> 35:32.434
Kinda feels like
old times all over again.

35:32.565 --> 35:34.654
You know, Ms. Marley,
her-her holiday treasure hunts

35:34.784 --> 35:36.046
were literally
our, our favorite thing

35:36.177 --> 35:37.483
to do at Christmas time.

35:37.570 --> 35:39.311
Yeah, and the six of you
were better than

35:39.441 --> 35:41.269
any of those other kids
whose parents

35:41.356 --> 35:43.010
brought them
out from town to play.

35:43.097 --> 35:44.664
Yeah, that's because
we knew the property

35:44.794 --> 35:47.275
backwards and forwards.
I mean, it was a wash.

35:47.362 --> 35:50.235
Well, if it's such a wash,
what's taking you so long now?

35:50.322 --> 35:53.325
Oh, Chip.
Come on, honey.

35:53.455 --> 35:54.891
They're gonna
find this treasure.

35:55.022 --> 35:56.806
I just know they are.

36:04.336 --> 36:06.251
Mind if I join you?

36:06.381 --> 36:07.687
Sure.

36:10.472 --> 36:11.821
Hey, I just,
I wanna clear the air

36:11.908 --> 36:13.780
about what happened
between us back then.

36:13.910 --> 36:17.392
All right. So you're not gonna
let this go, are you?

36:17.479 --> 36:20.265
Let's hear it.

36:20.352 --> 36:22.919
Look, I just wasn't
ready to come out, Austin.

36:23.050 --> 36:24.747
You know, my parents,

36:24.878 --> 36:27.359
they weren't as easy
as yours are, you know that.

36:27.489 --> 36:29.970
They're so much older,
so traditional,

36:30.057 --> 36:35.149
and I was always just terrified
of-of disappointing them.

36:35.236 --> 36:36.716
Whether it be getting
bad grades,

36:36.803 --> 36:38.152
or-or not going
to business school.

36:38.239 --> 36:40.850
And...

36:40.937 --> 36:42.635
The very last thing
I wanted to do was admit to them

36:42.765 --> 36:44.767
that I was gay,

36:44.898 --> 36:47.596
and least of all,
admit that I...

36:47.683 --> 36:48.728
you know,
fallen in love with you.

36:48.858 --> 36:50.730
Wh-wh-what?

36:50.860 --> 36:53.080
You had fallen in love with me?
Come on.

36:53.211 --> 36:54.647
That I find very hard
to believe

36:54.777 --> 36:56.257
considering I told you

36:56.344 --> 36:57.954
I loved you
three days after we kissed.

36:58.085 --> 37:00.174
And you just,
you just said nothing back.

37:00.305 --> 37:01.567
In fact, you just left.

37:01.697 --> 37:04.091
I know now that was a mistake.

37:04.178 --> 37:05.179
I wish I'd never
done that to you.

37:05.310 --> 37:06.702
Just left like that.

37:08.400 --> 37:10.010
You deserve better,

37:10.097 --> 37:11.881
especially from
your best friend.

37:14.319 --> 37:15.581
Well, I guess
I can understand

37:15.668 --> 37:18.366
where you were coming from,
in a way.

37:18.453 --> 37:20.977
It must've been challenging.
I don't know. I don't know.

37:21.108 --> 37:22.936
We're really different people, Everett.

37:23.023 --> 37:24.894
I was so ready to shout my
coming out

37:25.025 --> 37:28.028
from the rooftops,
like, "This is me!

37:28.158 --> 37:31.379
I'm amazing! Deal with it!"

37:31.466 --> 37:33.555
Yeah, I was always jealous
of that about you.

37:33.642 --> 37:35.775
Just how you,
just know yourself.

37:35.905 --> 37:40.258
Well, it is a blessing
and a curse.

37:40.388 --> 37:43.870
I did finally tell them though,
before they passed.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.263
I mean, they actually took it

37:45.393 --> 37:47.395
better than
I thought they would.

37:47.482 --> 37:48.788
I guess when you're that sick,

37:48.875 --> 37:50.050
the small things
that make us different

37:50.137 --> 37:53.836
just matter a little bit less.

37:53.967 --> 37:56.665
That they do.
Unless you're Ms. Marley, huh?

37:56.752 --> 37:59.668
Some people just go 100 percent
to the very end.

37:59.799 --> 38:02.062
Yeah, that she did.

38:02.149 --> 38:05.283
She was sound up there,
all the way until the very end.

38:06.762 --> 38:10.462
And then, then she went...

38:10.549 --> 38:12.072
you know, just as peaceful.

38:12.202 --> 38:14.988
You-you just come back
to take care of her?

38:15.118 --> 38:17.033
Yeah, I did.

38:17.120 --> 38:18.600
You know she was the one
who took care of my parents

38:18.731 --> 38:20.515
before we had to
move to Arizona.

38:20.602 --> 38:23.475
In fact, she was the one
who, who ordered them to move

38:23.605 --> 38:25.694
to a more arid climate
for their health.

38:25.781 --> 38:27.653
So I just,
I felt like I owed it to her

38:27.740 --> 38:30.482
for the time that she gave us
after Mr. Marley passed.

38:32.397 --> 38:35.095
Well, that was very
nice of you, Everett.

38:37.663 --> 38:39.708
All right, maybe I don't
need to be so upset

38:39.795 --> 38:41.449
about you being back here.

38:41.580 --> 38:44.060
And all in with
my parents.

38:44.191 --> 38:46.541
Okay. We're getting somewhere.

38:46.628 --> 38:47.977
But I do not know
how I feel about

38:48.108 --> 38:50.197
you spotting my dad at the gym.

39:10.957 --> 39:15.265
- Morning.
- Morning.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.355
- Already ready for you.
- Perfect.

39:17.485 --> 39:19.966
Thank you.
Ooh, this looks good.

39:20.053 --> 39:22.447
All right, don't touch.
It's not set yet.

39:22.577 --> 39:24.057
Okay, fine, fine.

39:26.886 --> 39:30.150
So, um, I couldn't help
but see Everett

39:30.237 --> 39:32.500
left with a smile last night.

39:32.587 --> 39:33.893
I think that's just
because he escaped

39:33.980 --> 39:35.242
you and dad unscathed, mom.

39:37.679 --> 39:40.073
Okay, fine. Yes.
We had a nice talk.

39:40.203 --> 39:42.380
He got to explain
his side of the story.

39:42.467 --> 39:44.991
But what? It only took him
forever to do so.

39:45.078 --> 39:47.341
Well, it's awfully hard
to make an apology

39:47.472 --> 39:49.517
when the person that
you're trying to apologize to

39:49.604 --> 39:52.390
won't listen.

39:52.477 --> 39:54.261
You weren't ready to hear it, sweetheart.

39:54.348 --> 39:56.524
And that's okay. We're not
always on the same page.

39:56.611 --> 39:59.397
And Everett, he needed to
respect that, too.

40:01.224 --> 40:04.184
But hey, look, um,
your dad and I,

40:04.271 --> 40:05.751
we're really sorry
that we didn't tell you

40:05.881 --> 40:07.622
that he was back here sooner.

40:07.753 --> 40:09.232
It just didn't feel like
one of those things

40:09.363 --> 40:11.365
we could mention over the phone.

40:11.452 --> 40:13.889
Look, I get it, mom,
but he has literally been

40:13.976 --> 40:16.196
working next door
for a while now.

40:16.326 --> 40:18.154
He told me he's been helping
Mrs. Marley with that property

40:18.241 --> 40:19.808
on and off for over a year,

40:19.895 --> 40:21.506
so I would imagine
that you had to

40:21.593 --> 40:23.377
run into him sometimes, right?

40:23.508 --> 40:27.076
Of course, I mean, we fed him
lunch a time or two,

40:27.207 --> 40:32.081
since I was taking Mrs. Marley
food all the time, anyway.

40:32.168 --> 40:35.824
But we never talked
about the two of you, though.

40:35.955 --> 40:38.348
We just wanted to
stay out of your business.

40:38.436 --> 40:41.134
That would be a first.

40:42.788 --> 40:45.747
Well, I do appreciate it.

40:45.878 --> 40:49.316
I guess it was good that we
finally got to clear the air.

40:49.403 --> 40:51.449
So does that mean
that maybe you and Ever--

40:51.579 --> 40:54.495
Mother? Don't.

40:54.582 --> 40:57.933
- This is just great.
- Good morning to you, too.

40:58.064 --> 40:59.457
What's wrong, dear?

40:59.587 --> 41:01.763
Michelle and Clay can't get away

41:01.894 --> 41:03.939
from going Christmas shopping
with Michelle's parents.

41:04.026 --> 41:06.289
They said they'll just
have to meet up with us later.

41:06.376 --> 41:08.683
Well, does this mean that
you and Ricky

41:08.770 --> 41:10.816
will be treasure hunting
on your own?

41:10.903 --> 41:13.383
Okay, you know what, if we
get lost out there tonight,

41:13.514 --> 41:15.385
I'm will find my way back
just so I can kill you.

41:15.473 --> 41:16.952
- Ah, coffee?
- Yes, please.

41:17.083 --> 41:18.998
Thank you so much.

41:20.608 --> 41:23.132
Wow, this must be
why your business

41:23.219 --> 41:24.656
runs so smoothly.

41:24.743 --> 41:26.005
There's so much love there.

41:26.092 --> 41:27.485
- So much.
- Yeah.

41:29.704 --> 41:30.792
This is ready.

41:35.057 --> 41:39.061
Ricky-y-y-y?

41:40.759 --> 41:44.197
Okay.

41:44.284 --> 41:46.808
And she still scares easily.

41:46.895 --> 41:48.462
I wasn't even
trying to scare you.

41:48.593 --> 41:50.029
I was just trying to keep warm.

41:50.116 --> 41:52.945
Yeah, well, the adrenaline rush
works, too.

41:53.032 --> 41:55.730
Well, let's go find more keys to
this buried treasure, shall we?

41:55.817 --> 41:56.949
Yeah. Let's do it.

41:57.036 --> 41:59.865
- Um, this way?
- Yeah, I'll--

41:59.995 --> 42:01.649
- Okay. Let's do it.
- Yeah.

42:04.217 --> 42:05.740
You guys looks great!

42:05.827 --> 42:07.481
I think you're ready
for some now, huh?

42:07.612 --> 42:09.701
Oh. Here, take some bark to go!

42:11.398 --> 42:14.183
- Bye.
- Hey.

42:14.270 --> 42:16.534
More jackets just
got dropped off!

42:16.664 --> 42:18.448
Can you sort these into sizes?

42:18.579 --> 42:19.885
- Yes, you got it, pops.
- All right.

42:21.234 --> 42:22.540
Thank you.

42:32.637 --> 42:34.464
Do you happen to have
any winter coats in a large?

42:34.595 --> 42:37.642
- Um, yeah. One second.
- Oh, awesome.

42:37.729 --> 42:39.295
Are you really here
for a jacket

42:39.426 --> 42:41.036
or you're just here to gloat
about your listing?

42:41.123 --> 42:43.473
Everett, of course,
I'm not here to gloat

42:43.604 --> 42:45.780
about the listing,
I'm not like that.

42:45.911 --> 42:47.521
I'm here to buy a jacket,
like I said.

42:47.652 --> 42:49.131
Since my prospective buyer

42:49.218 --> 42:51.438
for the Marley property
is flying in tomorrow

42:51.525 --> 42:53.745
and he just doesn't have
a proper winter coat of his own.

42:53.875 --> 42:56.182
Hi, how are you?
I'm Austin.

42:56.269 --> 42:58.227
Rochelle Romero.
Romero Realty.

42:58.314 --> 43:01.230
Oh, my goodness.
It's so nice to meet you.

43:01.317 --> 43:03.493
I'm Austin Craig, so my parents
live in the Craig chalet

43:03.624 --> 43:05.191
that's adjacent
to the Marley property.

43:05.278 --> 43:06.714
- Oh. Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

43:06.801 --> 43:09.021
We just have two
little issues with your request.

43:09.151 --> 43:11.763
First and foremost, this is
called "Jackets For Juniors,"

43:11.850 --> 43:13.765
so unless your buyer
is still in elementary school

43:13.852 --> 43:15.984
and can't afford his own coat,
I think our little pile

43:16.115 --> 43:17.899
here is going to be
a no-go for you.

43:18.030 --> 43:21.381
Secondly, I'd worry less about
giving your buyer a new coat

43:21.468 --> 43:23.470
and more about getting him
a new listing because

43:23.557 --> 43:24.689
the Marley property
is not going to be available

43:24.819 --> 43:27.039
for very much longer.

43:27.169 --> 43:29.998
And here's a little bag
of peppermint bark to go

43:30.129 --> 43:31.870
'cause we are awfully busy
giving these kids

43:31.957 --> 43:33.654
a very merry Christmas.

43:33.741 --> 43:34.786
Hm. No thanks.

43:39.834 --> 43:41.923
Wow. You're my hero.

43:42.010 --> 43:43.708
A cute Santa hero.

43:46.972 --> 43:50.279
I think this just might
be my key.

43:50.410 --> 43:51.977
What makes you think that?

43:52.107 --> 43:55.328
Where do you think half the old
bears in here came from?

43:55.458 --> 43:57.896
Oh, yeah. That's right.
Your collection.

43:57.983 --> 44:01.726
Yup. I turned ten
and the bear phase was done.

44:01.813 --> 44:04.467
But Ms. Marley was great.
I mean, she just made

44:04.554 --> 44:06.426
great use of them at the
carnival every year,

44:06.556 --> 44:08.863
letting kids who weren't old
enough to do the treasure hunt

44:08.950 --> 44:11.561
just come here and play
with them.

44:11.649 --> 44:13.651
- Well, after you then.
- Thanks.

44:19.004 --> 44:22.660
Wow! Ah!

44:22.747 --> 44:26.664
It looks exactly the same
in here. Ah!

44:26.751 --> 44:28.753
Wow, you had a lot of bears.

44:28.883 --> 44:29.928
I know.

44:31.712 --> 44:34.802
Okay. Where do you think
it could be?

44:34.933 --> 44:38.066
Mmm, maybe the holiday section?

44:38.153 --> 44:40.634
Okay, um, I'm gonna look
over here.

44:40.721 --> 44:41.679
Okay.

44:52.733 --> 44:54.474
- Mm. You see anything?
- Mm.

44:54.561 --> 44:56.650
I, I just see
fake flowers over here

44:56.737 --> 44:58.739
and knickknacks.

44:58.826 --> 45:00.698
Okay, it has to be here somewhere.

45:00.785 --> 45:04.832
Let me just...
let me just think. Okay.

45:04.919 --> 45:08.227
It has to be something
that I identify with.

45:08.357 --> 45:09.663
Half these things were yours.

45:09.750 --> 45:11.012
What don't you identify with?

45:14.059 --> 45:15.321
Ahh!

45:17.845 --> 45:19.978
Alice in Wonderland.

45:20.108 --> 45:22.458
Fifth grade, remember?

45:22.589 --> 45:24.634
You know, we put on
Alice in Wonderland,

45:24.765 --> 45:27.115
they wanted me to be Alice
and I wanted to be...

45:27.202 --> 45:29.074
The narrator. Yeah,
you wanted to be the narrator

45:29.204 --> 45:30.075
and dress up as a Dodo bird.

45:30.162 --> 45:31.772
I remember.

45:31.859 --> 45:33.905
Well, this wasn't here last time
we were here.

45:33.992 --> 45:35.950
She had to have put it here.

45:36.037 --> 45:41.260
Okay, but there's no key underneath.

45:41.347 --> 45:44.089
- My key! I found it!
- Oh, yes!

45:44.219 --> 45:47.483
- Okay, awesome. Um, so...
- Okay.

45:47.614 --> 45:49.355
So then...

45:49.485 --> 45:52.227
All right. Based on the
trajectory of the map,

45:52.314 --> 45:54.403
the next key isn't too far
from here.

45:54.490 --> 45:55.970
Well, didn't you used to
sell lemonade

45:56.057 --> 45:57.711
at Ms. Marley's old stand?

45:57.798 --> 45:59.321
They were Arnold Palmers,
thank you very much.

45:59.408 --> 46:02.455
Whatever. The point is,
lemonade stand is still here.

46:04.196 --> 46:06.024
I guess my key is next.

46:06.154 --> 46:07.634
Let's do this.

46:17.775 --> 46:20.212
Do you remember when we were
like twelve and your mom

46:20.299 --> 46:22.736
put the bark out before bed,
and we snuck down

46:22.823 --> 46:24.303
not realizing it hadn't set yet?

46:24.390 --> 46:25.870
Oh, yeah, I certainly do.

46:25.957 --> 46:28.176
You were going in
for crunch candy.

46:28.263 --> 46:30.309
You left literal fingerprints
in the peppermint bark.

46:33.138 --> 46:35.053
Yeah.

46:35.140 --> 46:38.360
Only thing is, next morning
when your mother found out

46:38.491 --> 46:40.362
you took the blame
so I wouldn't get in trouble.

46:40.493 --> 46:42.756
Yeah, well,
I was a very naughty boy.

46:42.887 --> 46:44.540
And I was always in situations
I shouldn't be,

46:44.627 --> 46:46.238
so no one was surprised
it was me.

46:46.325 --> 46:47.761
Well, what about now?

46:47.848 --> 46:49.415
What kinda situations are you
getting yourself

46:49.502 --> 46:51.373
into in the City of Angels?

46:51.460 --> 46:54.812
Ah! Tipper and I still like to
go out and party little bit.

46:54.899 --> 46:58.424
You know, happy hour on Friday,
but our version of a rager

46:58.554 --> 47:00.861
now is getting in bed at 8:00 pm
after fighting over

47:00.948 --> 47:02.863
the last piece of crispy
rice tuna.

47:02.994 --> 47:04.386
Because they always only
give you five.

47:04.473 --> 47:07.128
Exactly. It's the worst.

47:07.259 --> 47:08.826
Why, at least you have someone
to fight over it with.

47:08.913 --> 47:11.829
Unfortunately, I have to eat all
five pieces by myself.

47:11.916 --> 47:14.832
This means harder cardio
the next day.

47:14.919 --> 47:16.572
What about you?

47:16.703 --> 47:17.747
How does it feel
after being back here?

47:17.835 --> 47:20.315
You miss San Fran living?

47:20.402 --> 47:23.318
Yeah, I do.
I love San Fran.

47:23.405 --> 47:25.277
I mean, I don't miss the rain,
and I don't miss writing that

47:25.407 --> 47:29.368
rent check, but I miss
the culture, and the people.

47:29.498 --> 47:30.543
Hm.

47:32.197 --> 47:34.199
So, uh, did you ever...

47:34.286 --> 47:37.202
I don't know, have anyone
special at any point there?

47:37.289 --> 47:38.681
What, like a boyfriend?

47:38.768 --> 47:41.989
Not a boyfriend.
Betta fish... parrot?

47:42.076 --> 47:43.948
Yeah, well,
sadly, I had neither.

47:44.078 --> 47:46.646
You know, I think once
I, I finished my MBA

47:46.733 --> 47:48.953
and my parents were gone,
I just...

47:49.040 --> 47:50.432
I just wanted to make money
and travel.

47:50.519 --> 47:51.956
You know?

47:52.086 --> 47:53.696
Did you travel?

47:53.783 --> 47:56.612
Ah... You know, not really.

47:56.743 --> 47:58.832
I-I just kept making money
working as a consultant.

47:58.963 --> 48:01.313
You know, travel's still kind of
idling on the list.

48:01.400 --> 48:03.358
- Hm.
- You know?

48:03.445 --> 48:05.578
- What about you?
- Me?

48:05.665 --> 48:09.843
Uh, I, on the other hand,
had a lot of relationships.

48:09.930 --> 48:12.628
One year it was Chad,
the next year it was Brad.

48:12.759 --> 48:14.979
It was all kind of amusing
at some point

48:15.109 --> 48:16.632
until it wasn't.

48:16.763 --> 48:18.460
That's when I threw myself
into my career

48:18.547 --> 48:20.114
and things really started
to take off for Tipper and I.

48:20.245 --> 48:23.509
So, I guess it all
works out, huh?

48:23.596 --> 48:24.814
Yeah, depending on how you
feel about things.

48:24.945 --> 48:25.903
Are you happy?

48:27.600 --> 48:30.603
Yeah.
Yeah, I am, mostly.

48:30.690 --> 48:34.650
I-I do feel it these days
myself, like getting older.

48:34.737 --> 48:37.392
I...

48:37.479 --> 48:39.742
might be kinda nice
to have someone.

48:39.829 --> 48:41.483
Yeah, I know what you mean.

48:45.052 --> 48:46.445
Oh, you take it.
It's your favorite.

48:51.624 --> 48:52.581
Thank you.

49:03.941 --> 49:06.465
All right. You wanna go inside,
I'll check around outside.

49:06.552 --> 49:08.249
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay. Cool.

49:08.380 --> 49:09.816
Let me check over here.

49:14.429 --> 49:16.127
Whoa!

49:20.392 --> 49:21.784
What can I get for you?

49:21.915 --> 49:23.482
Besides this flawless holiday

49:23.569 --> 49:25.353
lighting scheme I just conjured,
of course.

49:25.440 --> 49:27.051
Ricky, stop playing, okay.
We need to find this key.

49:32.665 --> 49:34.275
Ricky!

49:34.362 --> 49:37.539
Come on, seriously.
I mean it. Stop playing.

49:37.670 --> 49:38.888
Seriously!

49:38.976 --> 49:40.934
Really?

49:41.021 --> 49:44.068
We come back here and you revert
to being a child all over again?

49:44.155 --> 49:48.072
Ah, there's a, uh,
there's an animal there.

49:48.159 --> 49:50.552
You mean the fake owl that you
look exactly like right now?

49:50.683 --> 49:52.076
Now move. Okay?

49:52.163 --> 49:53.686
- Okay.
- Till you find this key.

49:56.254 --> 49:57.516
Hey, did you check the freezer?

49:59.083 --> 50:01.868
- No, not yet.
- Okay.

50:01.955 --> 50:03.478
Hm.
What're these doing here?

50:03.609 --> 50:05.480
Here, let's check them.

50:05.567 --> 50:06.873
Maybe they have...

50:09.963 --> 50:13.140
What is that?
Mm-hm.

50:13.271 --> 50:16.274
Four down, two to go.
We are on a roll.

50:16.404 --> 50:17.188
Perfect!

50:22.497 --> 50:24.499
I had no idea you can spend

50:24.586 --> 50:26.371
that much time shoppin'
in Belleville.

50:26.501 --> 50:27.937
I mean, Michelle and her mom,

50:28.068 --> 50:30.027
they sniffed every scent
in the candle store.

50:30.114 --> 50:31.854
I'm not joking.
I'm not joking, guys.

50:31.985 --> 50:34.640
Okay. My mom's taste in scents
gets tainted after a while

50:34.770 --> 50:36.076
and becomes questionable.

50:36.163 --> 50:38.078
Somebody needed to help.

50:38.209 --> 50:39.297
Clay, how's your
family doin'?

50:39.384 --> 50:40.776
We're stayin' there
tonight.

50:40.907 --> 50:42.865
And I'm lookin' forward
to stayin' in tomorrow.

50:42.996 --> 50:45.868
Mm-hm. Where you gets to play
videogames with his father

50:45.999 --> 50:48.828
all day, while I have to help
your mother in the kitchen

50:48.958 --> 50:51.309
so she doesn't have another
holiday meltdown.

50:51.396 --> 50:54.486
Look, I didn't ask my
parents to have three kids.

50:54.573 --> 50:57.576
And I didn't ask my siblings
to have three kids of their own.

50:57.663 --> 50:59.534
Okay? And if you think,
would you just order food

50:59.621 --> 51:01.101
and let me pay for it,
like I suggested.

51:01.188 --> 51:02.972
Then it'd save 'em
so much grief.

51:03.060 --> 51:05.105
Okay, well, I don't
feel bad for either for you.

51:05.236 --> 51:06.976
My parents are in Cabo
waiting for me

51:07.064 --> 51:11.198
and resort food is zero fun when
all you want is some tradition.

51:12.852 --> 51:14.897
Well, you're getting some
tradition here.

51:15.028 --> 51:16.812
Yeah. You know, surprisingly,

51:16.899 --> 51:20.033
this trip is exactly
what I needed.

51:20.164 --> 51:21.861
We're all very lucky
to have our families,

51:21.991 --> 51:24.820
but especially this little
family right here.

51:24.951 --> 51:26.387
- Mm-hmm.
- Aw!

51:26.474 --> 51:29.042
I will cheers to that. <i>Salut.</i>

51:29.173 --> 51:30.391
- Mm-mm.
<i>- Salut.</i>

51:32.567 --> 51:35.048
So...

51:35.179 --> 51:37.746
Looks like we might actually
find this treasure, huh?

51:37.833 --> 51:39.661
Yes. It's crazy, right?

51:39.748 --> 51:41.533
I mean, what if there's
a lot of money in there?

51:41.663 --> 51:44.101
Well, we're gonna need it,
because it just so happens

51:44.231 --> 51:47.539
that our prospective new partner
is expecting some real equity

51:47.626 --> 51:49.758
from us in the new year,
if we hope to manage

51:49.845 --> 51:51.412
his client roster at capacity.

51:51.543 --> 51:53.501
That's great news.

51:53.588 --> 51:54.502
- Congrats!
- Thank you.

51:54.633 --> 51:56.287
Thank you.

51:56.417 --> 51:57.505
But what if there's not a lot?

51:57.636 --> 51:59.377
You know?

51:59.507 --> 52:01.553
Like, what then?

52:01.683 --> 52:04.251
I mean, I... I-I don't want to
be a Debbie Downer,

52:04.338 --> 52:06.123
but it just seems like

52:06.210 --> 52:08.560
you guys have a lot riding
on this so-called treasure.

52:08.690 --> 52:11.302
I mean, Ev, you want to put
a down payment on this place,

52:11.389 --> 52:14.392
and you guys are hopin'
for a lump sum investment too.

52:14.479 --> 52:16.394
I just...

52:16.481 --> 52:17.830
I, I really don't think

52:17.917 --> 52:19.832
the Marley's
were made of money, guys.

52:19.919 --> 52:21.268
Well, Clay and I

52:21.355 --> 52:23.096
definitely don't need
a treasure, okay?

52:23.227 --> 52:26.273
So, whatever it is,
you guys can split it equally.

52:26.360 --> 52:28.319
We're just here for the cocoa.

52:28.406 --> 52:30.756
Well, that's very sweet,
but let's cross that bridge

52:30.843 --> 52:32.584
when we get there.

52:32.714 --> 52:34.629
Who knows? There may be plenty
to go around.

52:34.760 --> 52:36.718
But first things first...

52:36.849 --> 52:38.633
We've got two keys to
find tomorrow.

52:52.473 --> 52:55.041
So, according to this map,
the last two keys are,

52:55.128 --> 52:56.869
are somewhere around here.

52:56.956 --> 52:59.741
And if this was Clay's,
then one of ours is here.

52:59.872 --> 53:00.873
And that would mean that
the other one

53:00.960 --> 53:03.136
is on the Kreggs property.

53:03.267 --> 53:06.139
Maybe my key is hidden
under my parents' house?

53:06.226 --> 53:07.445
Okay.

53:07.532 --> 53:10.274
But if these two are your keys,

53:10.361 --> 53:13.842
this X is Clay's, then where the
heck is our actual treasure?

53:32.296 --> 53:34.733
Wow. Quaint.

53:34.820 --> 53:36.996
Did you put up all the, uh,
adorable Christmas stuff?

53:37.126 --> 53:38.432
- Mm.
- No.

53:38.519 --> 53:40.739
No. Rochelle is here
with a buyer.

53:40.826 --> 53:43.611
- Who's Rochelle?
- The ruthless realtor.

53:43.698 --> 53:45.004
You know what?

53:45.091 --> 53:47.702
You guys go look for the key.

53:47.789 --> 53:49.835
We'll handle these two.
Right, Ricky?

53:49.922 --> 53:52.533
- What?
- Follow my lead.

53:52.620 --> 53:54.970
Uh, Tipper,
that's not a great idea.

53:56.189 --> 53:57.625
Well, hello there.

53:57.712 --> 53:59.323
Hi.

53:59.410 --> 54:01.063
Hi!
You are?

54:01.150 --> 54:03.501
I'm Tipper Tisdale.
CEO of Dark Dodo Entertainment.

54:03.588 --> 54:06.068
- And you are?
- Rochelle Raimo.

54:06.155 --> 54:07.592
I have the listing
on this property.

54:08.767 --> 54:09.811
Ricky?

54:09.942 --> 54:12.771
Yeah. Uh, sorry, uh...

54:12.901 --> 54:15.513
Ms. Tisdale's company called

54:15.643 --> 54:16.601
and, um...

54:18.559 --> 54:20.082
I figured the city board
would really

54:20.213 --> 54:22.128
want them to see this place.

54:22.215 --> 54:24.913
Apparently, they're producing
a movie with these influencers

54:25.000 --> 54:26.872
and they thought this property
would be a great fit.

54:26.959 --> 54:31.572
So, we just, um, b-buy.

54:31.659 --> 54:33.313
I've never heard of Dark Dodo.

54:33.400 --> 54:36.185
And I've never heard of Raimo
Realty, yet here we are.

54:36.273 --> 54:39.276
But just so you know, we manage
some of thehottest

54:39.363 --> 54:40.364
influencers in Hollywood.

54:40.451 --> 54:41.974
Do you know Courtney Hollister?

54:42.061 --> 54:44.150
Oh, of course.
Uh, she one of yours?

54:44.237 --> 54:47.762
No, but we represent many
like her. And you are?

54:47.849 --> 54:50.330
Kal Groff. I'm in development
consulting for some

54:50.417 --> 54:52.463
pretty big time investors.

54:52.593 --> 54:54.682
Love to have a chat some time.
Always looking for new ventures.

54:54.813 --> 54:57.424
As am I. But I have yet to find
any here.

54:57.511 --> 55:00.340
I mean, this property just...
won't do.

55:00.427 --> 55:03.343
Oh, no. Really?
I, I thought you said--

55:03.430 --> 55:05.998
I said it looked picturesque
from the outside,

55:06.085 --> 55:08.870
the inside is a mess.

55:08.957 --> 55:12.439
From the poor sewage drainage
to the severely eroded flooring

55:12.570 --> 55:14.180
underneath the beautiful wood,
I just can't.

55:14.267 --> 55:15.747
I can't.

55:15.834 --> 55:17.183
And the water table, you know,

55:17.314 --> 55:18.271
in winter it must be
a nightmare.

55:18.358 --> 55:20.142
What water table?

55:20.273 --> 55:22.014
Well, w-would it matter if were
knocking it down any way?

55:22.101 --> 55:24.756
- I mean, wouldn't that help?
- You know, you'd think.

55:24.886 --> 55:26.758
But unless you're planning
on building a ski-lodge

55:26.888 --> 55:30.239
on some really big ski-poles,
I don't think so.

55:30.327 --> 55:32.981
I mean, the sub-surface water
coming from the snow-runoff

55:33.068 --> 55:36.594
in the soil just screams
insurance nightmare.

55:36.681 --> 55:38.378
Not to mention, if we shot here,

55:38.509 --> 55:40.249
we would be shooting
in a hazard lane.

55:40.337 --> 55:41.250
I mean, ugh!

55:41.381 --> 55:43.470
Yeah.

55:43.601 --> 55:45.733
Um, I mean, I think
that sounds like something

55:45.820 --> 55:47.518
my people definitely
aren't gonna want to risk.

55:47.648 --> 55:50.608
Right? But you know what?
You and I should have a chat.

55:50.695 --> 55:53.480
You know? We should go into town
talk about your investors.

55:53.567 --> 55:55.090
Oh, I, I know a great
coffee spot.

55:55.221 --> 55:56.962
- Uh, do you like cappuccinos?
- Sure.

55:57.049 --> 55:58.485
They make the best cappuccinos.

55:58.572 --> 55:59.399
- It's-it's really close by.
- Let's do it.

55:59.486 --> 56:00.922
It's-it's super close.

56:01.009 --> 56:02.359
- Rochelle? Are you...
- Kal? Kal, is it?

56:02.446 --> 56:03.664
- You coming?
- Yeah. They have whiskey, right?

56:03.795 --> 56:05.231
She actually got them to leave.

56:06.537 --> 56:08.060
Wow.

56:08.147 --> 56:09.670
That's what she does.

56:09.757 --> 56:10.715
Let's go.

56:15.241 --> 56:16.895
Wonder if she left it
in my old mug.

56:19.724 --> 56:21.508
Nope.

56:21.595 --> 56:23.205
Did you really stay over here
that often?

56:23.336 --> 56:25.469
Yeah, the last couple of months.

56:25.556 --> 56:26.687
Every night.

56:26.818 --> 56:28.646
I practically lived here.

56:28.733 --> 56:30.430
I slept on the couch in the den

56:30.561 --> 56:32.737
so I could be closer
to her room, and,

56:32.824 --> 56:35.304
you know, hear her if she called
out and needed anything.

56:35.392 --> 56:37.350
That's sweet. You know, we used
to have to do that for Tipper

56:37.481 --> 56:38.525
after bad break-ups.

56:41.615 --> 56:42.660
Wait, the den.

56:42.747 --> 56:44.270
She used to call it my room.

56:46.054 --> 56:47.055
Come on.

56:57.892 --> 56:59.851
I sure wish I would've had the
chance to put up her tree.

56:59.938 --> 57:01.418
Mrs. Marley always loved it.

57:05.247 --> 57:08.163
They were really cute, huh?

57:08.250 --> 57:11.210
I remember once she told my mom
that she was grateful,

57:11.340 --> 57:14.387
even though she couldn't have
kids, she had us.

57:14.518 --> 57:15.997
What do you think Mrs. Marley
would've thought

57:16.084 --> 57:17.434
about us being gay?

57:17.521 --> 57:19.436
- Oh, she knew.
- She what?

57:19.566 --> 57:22.482
Yeah, I told her when came back,
but she said she already knew.

57:22.569 --> 57:24.223
Said she always knew.

57:24.353 --> 57:25.790
Said she called it when we were
both about twelve.

57:25.877 --> 57:27.052
How did she know?

57:27.139 --> 57:28.575
Well, I asked her
the same thing.

57:28.662 --> 57:32.361
All she said was,
"I'm old, not blind."

57:32.449 --> 57:35.408
You know, I told her about us,
too, in high school.

57:35.495 --> 57:37.062
How things ended.

57:37.149 --> 57:39.673
And how I wished things
would've ended.

57:39.760 --> 57:41.588
Well, I guess everything goes
the way it does

57:41.719 --> 57:43.242
for a reason, yeah?

57:43.329 --> 57:44.330
Yeah.

57:47.333 --> 57:49.074
We spent a lot of nights
sitting there by the fire,

57:49.161 --> 57:50.771
her telling life stories...

57:50.858 --> 57:52.512
You know, she had the most
amazing life

57:52.599 --> 57:53.731
always without regret.

57:53.818 --> 57:55.123
I-I loved that about her.

58:00.781 --> 58:02.043
Wait, the fire place.

58:02.174 --> 58:04.089
The fire place?

58:21.062 --> 58:22.977
My gosh. You found it.

58:23.108 --> 58:25.023
We found it.

58:25.110 --> 58:27.286
All right. Where to next?

58:27.373 --> 58:30.071
I mean, unlike everybody else,
I have zero clue

58:30.158 --> 58:32.204
where mine might be, so I guess
we've got a little bit of time.

58:35.033 --> 58:38.471
Maybe in the spirit of Christmas
we can, uh...

58:38.558 --> 58:40.821
do what you suggested, and put
up the Marley's Christmas tree

58:40.952 --> 58:42.606
for old time's sake.

58:42.693 --> 58:44.042
Let's do it.

58:54.531 --> 58:56.533
- Christmas tree.
- Here you go.

59:30.305 --> 59:32.264
It looks so good.

59:32.351 --> 59:34.135
I always loved the attention
to detail Mr. Marley

59:34.266 --> 59:36.398
would put into his
Christmas decorations.

59:36.485 --> 59:39.053
Oh, and when they would dress up
as Mr. and Mrs. Claus

59:39.140 --> 59:41.316
at the Candy Cane Carnival
every year.

59:41.403 --> 59:43.057
Oh, yeah.

59:43.144 --> 59:44.276
Remember how they used to
always make us

59:44.406 --> 59:45.669
dress up as their
Candy Cane Kids?

59:47.453 --> 59:49.977
They sure brought this place
a lot of joy.

59:50.108 --> 59:51.805
I guess, in a way,
they still are.

59:51.892 --> 59:53.285
This Christmas is turning
out to be one of the best

59:53.372 --> 59:55.679
I've had in a long time.

59:55.766 --> 59:57.855
You know, I always wished
I had siblings.

59:57.942 --> 59:59.639
So when Tipper's parents
moved out of town,

59:59.726 --> 1:00:01.728
and she wasn't coming back
for the holidays...

1:00:01.815 --> 1:00:03.251
Michelle and Clay,
their schedules are so tight,

1:00:03.338 --> 1:00:04.426
never saw them.

1:00:04.557 --> 1:00:06.515
It just hasn't been the same.

1:00:06.603 --> 1:00:08.430
Well...

1:00:08.517 --> 1:00:11.695
every Christmas
since I left this place.

1:00:11.782 --> 1:00:15.133
Everyone I spent away from you,
just hasn't felt the same.

1:00:22.357 --> 1:00:24.446
Okay, but you did learn
how to kiss.

1:00:24.577 --> 1:00:26.579
- What?
- Just playin'.

1:00:26.710 --> 1:00:28.059
The kiss on the playscape
when we were young,

1:00:28.146 --> 1:00:30.452
it was great too,
but, uh...

1:00:30.539 --> 1:00:32.454
this one came without
any hesitation.

1:00:36.894 --> 1:00:38.809
Wait, the playscape.

1:00:38.896 --> 1:00:40.158
Your key.

1:00:41.812 --> 1:00:42.508
Yes.

1:00:46.730 --> 1:00:49.602
But why would Mrs. Marley
hide my key over here?

1:00:49.689 --> 1:00:51.604
'Cause she knew about our kiss.
I told her.

1:00:51.691 --> 1:00:53.650
- You did?
- Yeah.

1:00:53.737 --> 1:00:56.174
She said she always knew
we were perfect for each other.

1:00:56.261 --> 1:00:58.176
- She did?
- Yup.

1:00:58.306 --> 1:01:00.526
Well, she's not wrong, but...

1:01:00.657 --> 1:01:03.137
it still doesn't make
a lot of sense.

1:01:03.224 --> 1:01:05.531
All of the other keys
are hidden on her property.

1:01:05.618 --> 1:01:07.098
There's no way she could've
hidden my key here

1:01:07.185 --> 1:01:09.666
without my parents knowing.

1:01:09.753 --> 1:01:13.408
Would you ever stop to think
that maybe your parents do know?

1:01:13.539 --> 1:01:14.845
Okay, now I'm really gonna
kill them.

1:01:19.153 --> 1:01:20.024
Oh!

1:01:23.070 --> 1:01:24.028
Wow!

1:01:25.464 --> 1:01:27.335
Wow! This is incredible.

1:01:29.598 --> 1:01:31.513
My key.

1:01:31.600 --> 1:01:33.037
It was here this whole time.

1:01:35.517 --> 1:01:39.739
Ms. Marley always did have such
a sense of humor, doesn't she?

1:01:39.826 --> 1:01:41.959
You two knew about this,
didn't you?

1:01:42.089 --> 1:01:44.265
Let's just say, we gave
Ms. Marley a little help

1:01:44.396 --> 1:01:46.137
when she came to use
with the idea.

1:01:46.267 --> 1:01:48.356
So you knew where our
keys where this whole time?

1:01:50.924 --> 1:01:53.057
Wait, do you know
where the treasure is?

1:01:53.144 --> 1:01:54.972
Actually, no. That's the one
thing we don't know.

1:01:55.059 --> 1:01:56.625
Only you kids can answer that.

1:01:56.756 --> 1:01:58.062
And the answer's hidden somewhere...

1:01:59.324 --> 1:02:00.281
We can't say.

1:02:00.412 --> 1:02:01.543
What? Why not?

1:02:01.674 --> 1:02:04.242
What does that wall tell you?

1:02:13.251 --> 1:02:14.556
This is the key to the
clubhouse, isn't it?

1:02:15.949 --> 1:02:17.646
Okay. All right, fine.

1:02:17.734 --> 1:02:20.214
We'll do it without you
tomorrow with the whole gang.

1:02:25.829 --> 1:02:27.439
All right. Sounds like a plan.

1:02:34.620 --> 1:02:36.448
This is insane.

1:02:54.771 --> 1:02:55.946
We're in!

1:02:56.076 --> 1:02:58.339
We're in!

1:03:01.778 --> 1:03:02.648
Oh!

1:03:05.694 --> 1:03:06.652
Wow!

1:03:11.352 --> 1:03:12.310
Oh.

1:03:13.702 --> 1:03:15.182
- Wow.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1:03:15.269 --> 1:03:17.619
This, this must be it.

1:03:17.750 --> 1:03:19.926
Yeah, but where are the locks?

1:03:20.013 --> 1:03:22.320
Maybe there's a safe inside,
I don't know.

1:03:30.894 --> 1:03:32.199
- What is all that?
- Oh!

1:03:32.286 --> 1:03:34.549
Are those costumes for us?

1:03:34.680 --> 1:03:35.942
Looks like it.

1:03:36.073 --> 1:03:37.683
- But, why?
- Thank you.

1:03:39.511 --> 1:03:42.862
Crazy Ms. Marley got us
Candy Cane costumes.

1:03:42.993 --> 1:03:45.212
She did. Guess she wanted us
to put on

1:03:45.299 --> 1:03:46.953
one last carnival
for Belleville.

1:03:47.084 --> 1:03:49.564
One last carnival?

1:03:49.651 --> 1:03:53.481
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve.
It's a little too late for that.

1:03:53.612 --> 1:03:55.353
She probably didn't think we'd
be finishing it this late

1:03:55.440 --> 1:03:56.920
in the game...

1:03:57.007 --> 1:03:59.052
but, hey, maybe not all is lost.

1:03:59.183 --> 1:04:01.576
Maybe we can come up
with something.

1:04:01.707 --> 1:04:03.274
You're always comin' up
with something.

1:04:03.361 --> 1:04:04.841
Hello.
What about the treasure?

1:04:07.017 --> 1:04:08.366
I think we might be
standing on it.

1:04:09.933 --> 1:04:11.412
Ah-huh!

1:04:21.379 --> 1:04:22.684
- Good work, Tipper.
- Thank you.

1:04:26.688 --> 1:04:27.559
Guys, I think I hit something.

1:04:27.646 --> 1:04:28.777
Ah!

1:04:28.865 --> 1:04:29.996
- What?
- What? Is it heavy?

1:04:30.083 --> 1:04:31.389
Could it be gold?

1:04:34.827 --> 1:04:36.133
No, it's definitely not gold.

1:04:36.220 --> 1:04:37.874
It's-it's not heavy.

1:04:42.530 --> 1:04:43.792
- Uh, keys?
- Keys.

1:04:44.924 --> 1:04:46.230
Let's do this.

1:04:51.235 --> 1:04:53.063
It's color-coded, you fools.

1:04:53.150 --> 1:04:55.239
Um... okay

1:04:56.327 --> 1:04:57.589
All right, I get it.

1:04:58.895 --> 1:04:59.896
Wow!

1:05:02.246 --> 1:05:04.770
"To my friends, the
Craig's. Love, the Marley's."

1:05:06.554 --> 1:05:07.425
Oh.

1:05:10.907 --> 1:05:12.082
Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe

1:05:12.212 --> 1:05:13.910
she left this to my parents.

1:05:13.997 --> 1:05:15.955
There's no way
they know about this.

1:05:16.042 --> 1:05:18.349
It's her old pearl necklace
from the South Seas.

1:05:18.436 --> 1:05:20.699
I mean, I remember it so well.

1:05:20.786 --> 1:05:23.049
Eighteen carat gold
with a diamond clasp.

1:05:23.180 --> 1:05:26.966
I mean, this is at least
$50,000, if not more!

1:05:27.053 --> 1:05:29.099
Oh! That is so sweet!

1:05:31.884 --> 1:05:34.017
"To my six rascals."

1:05:35.844 --> 1:05:37.716
"Thanks for keeping us young
all those years,

1:05:37.803 --> 1:05:39.457
and coming back for
one last adventure."

1:05:47.944 --> 1:05:48.945
Guys.

1:05:50.555 --> 1:05:52.426
- It is gold.
- What?

1:05:52.513 --> 1:05:57.823
About $250,000 worth
of, of old mining stock.

1:05:57.910 --> 1:06:00.391
What?

1:06:00.478 --> 1:06:02.306
I don't believe it.
He's right.

1:06:02.436 --> 1:06:06.005
Austin! That's exactly what we
need to partner with Theo.

1:06:06.092 --> 1:06:08.921
I mean, it's 60K between
each of us,

1:06:09.008 --> 1:06:11.097
if Michelle and Clay
don't want their cuts.

1:06:11.228 --> 1:06:13.578
- Oh. Hm.
- Hey...

1:06:13.665 --> 1:06:15.406
You can have my portion, Ev.

1:06:15.493 --> 1:06:17.277
I don't really need it.
I'm fine.

1:06:17.408 --> 1:06:19.410
Wait, what's wrong?

1:06:19.540 --> 1:06:22.413
Ev needs at least 250K
to save the Marley place.

1:06:22.543 --> 1:06:24.154
You know, with back taxes
and a down payment.

1:06:26.286 --> 1:06:29.637
Well, that's okay. We, we can
figure out something.

1:06:29.724 --> 1:06:31.596
Yeah, maybe you can use your
portion to, you know,

1:06:31.726 --> 1:06:32.684
buy some more time.

1:06:32.814 --> 1:06:34.164
No. No, there is no more time.

1:06:36.601 --> 1:06:37.994
It's fine. Doesn't matter
anyway now.

1:06:44.261 --> 1:06:45.436
Everett.

1:06:45.523 --> 1:06:46.480
Hey, Everett.

1:06:49.135 --> 1:06:52.095
Don't you think maybe it's time
to let this place go?

1:06:52.182 --> 1:06:54.749
I mean, what were you going
to do with it anyway?

1:06:54.836 --> 1:06:56.577
I don't know.

1:06:56.708 --> 1:06:58.362
Fix it up. I...

1:06:58.449 --> 1:07:00.103
Make it a place
people want to come to again.

1:07:00.233 --> 1:07:01.626
Everett, don't you think
you might be living

1:07:01.756 --> 1:07:03.149
in the past a little bit?

1:07:03.236 --> 1:07:05.499
No. I still think there's
something here

1:07:05.630 --> 1:07:08.067
that's worth fighting for.

1:07:08.154 --> 1:07:09.938
I was hoping that
you would come to L.A.

1:07:10.026 --> 1:07:12.158
You can stay with Tipper and I
while you look for your own

1:07:12.245 --> 1:07:15.335
place, or,
you could just... stay.

1:07:15.422 --> 1:07:17.598
Austin, you know how I feel
about you.

1:07:17.685 --> 1:07:19.557
I just...

1:07:19.687 --> 1:07:21.385
I don't know if me moving off

1:07:21.472 --> 1:07:23.213
is the best solution
to my problems.

1:07:23.343 --> 1:07:26.216
I mean, I've spent half my life
moving for other people.

1:07:26.303 --> 1:07:28.044
First my parents and then coming
back here for Ms. Marley.

1:07:28.131 --> 1:07:29.871
I just...

1:07:29.958 --> 1:07:31.830
I need some roots.

1:07:31.960 --> 1:07:34.224
We could be each other's roots.

1:07:36.487 --> 1:07:37.488
I need some time.

1:07:37.575 --> 1:07:39.446
You need some time?

1:07:39.577 --> 1:07:41.274
Don't you think you've had
enough time to think?

1:07:41.361 --> 1:07:43.407
- I...
- You know what?

1:07:43.494 --> 1:07:45.887
Maybe it's time that I think
about finally moving on

1:07:45.974 --> 1:07:47.411
from you as well.

1:08:23.795 --> 1:08:24.796
Austin.

1:08:26.232 --> 1:08:27.451
- Tipper.
- Thank you.

1:08:33.631 --> 1:08:36.634
Hey, buddy.
It's your favorite popcorn.

1:08:36.721 --> 1:08:39.071
Special seasoning,
just like you like it.

1:08:39.158 --> 1:08:40.855
No, thanks, mom.
I'm not hungry.

1:08:42.814 --> 1:08:43.815
Okay.

1:08:46.078 --> 1:08:49.299
Would it help for you to know
that Ms. Marley planned

1:08:49.429 --> 1:08:52.389
this whole thing not only to get
everyone back together again,

1:08:52.519 --> 1:08:55.696
but even more specifically,
to get you and Everett

1:08:55.827 --> 1:08:57.263
back together.

1:08:57.394 --> 1:08:59.047
- Why would she do that?
- Because...

1:08:59.135 --> 1:09:00.875
She knew how upset Everett was

1:09:01.006 --> 1:09:02.877
for the way he left things
back then.

1:09:03.008 --> 1:09:05.358
Apparently, they talked
about it a lot.

1:09:05.445 --> 1:09:08.579
And she also knew that the two
of you would never talk again

1:09:08.666 --> 1:09:12.017
on your own volition, so she
asked me and your dad and I

1:09:12.104 --> 1:09:14.367
if we would help to
make it happen.

1:09:14.454 --> 1:09:16.891
Yeah. And we agreed.

1:09:17.022 --> 1:09:19.633
So long as it we could stand
at arm's length.

1:09:19.720 --> 1:09:22.506
We didn't want to force anything
on you kids,

1:09:22.593 --> 1:09:26.118
so... we let it be
everyone's choice.

1:09:26.249 --> 1:09:28.599
Wait. So you guys did this
back in the spring?

1:09:28.686 --> 1:09:31.341
- Before Ms. Marley passed?
- Yeah.

1:09:31.471 --> 1:09:33.038
And we kept it from Everett too.

1:09:37.260 --> 1:09:40.524
Well, that was very sweet
of her, but...

1:09:40.654 --> 1:09:44.223
The truth is, ol' Mrs. Marley
can't conjure up a new future

1:09:44.310 --> 1:09:47.531
from the grave through a,
a silly kid's treasure hunt

1:09:47.661 --> 1:09:50.011
any more than she can change
what's happened in the past,

1:09:50.098 --> 1:09:51.709
no matter how great
her gift was...

1:09:55.278 --> 1:09:57.628
I love Everett.

1:09:57.715 --> 1:10:00.631
I have always loved Everett.

1:10:00.718 --> 1:10:05.549
But he wasn't ready then, and he
certainly isn't ready now.

1:10:05.636 --> 1:10:09.074
And all the twinkling romantic
lights, and reminiscing,

1:10:09.161 --> 1:10:10.902
and the reliving of how great
our childhood was,

1:10:10.989 --> 1:10:12.208
is never gonna change that.

1:10:35.405 --> 1:10:36.362
Hey.

1:10:39.583 --> 1:10:41.106
I was texting with
Tipper last night.

1:10:42.629 --> 1:10:44.805
How ya doin'?

1:10:44.892 --> 1:10:46.111
All right, I guess.

1:10:47.982 --> 1:10:50.637
Just all right?

1:10:50.724 --> 1:10:53.771
You're in love. Ev,
you shouldn't just be all right.

1:10:56.774 --> 1:10:58.254
I just, I don't know
what's next.

1:11:00.560 --> 1:11:02.867
I keep trying to figure out
my life and it just never

1:11:02.997 --> 1:11:05.696
pans out the way I hoped.

1:11:05.826 --> 1:11:08.046
You know, I thought if I could
get this place,

1:11:08.176 --> 1:11:10.657
I could start over.

1:11:10.744 --> 1:11:12.268
But what were you really hoping
to start over?

1:11:13.834 --> 1:11:15.445
You can't go back, Ev.

1:11:15.532 --> 1:11:20.101
Not to when we were kids,
not to high school.

1:11:20.232 --> 1:11:23.366
And I know how much you loved
them, but you can't bring

1:11:23.453 --> 1:11:25.106
the Marley's back
no matter how much you try to

1:11:25.193 --> 1:11:27.805
keep this place afloat.

1:11:27.892 --> 1:11:30.286
It's up to us to remember them,

1:11:30.373 --> 1:11:32.113
and to help keep their
memories alive.

1:11:36.161 --> 1:11:37.118
You're right.

1:11:40.208 --> 1:11:42.994
I need to let this place go.

1:11:43.081 --> 1:11:44.430
I don't know,
maybe Belleville, too.

1:11:48.216 --> 1:11:50.001
And maybe, maybe part of me
did come back here

1:11:50.088 --> 1:11:52.525
hoping I could go back in
time, but you're right.

1:11:52.656 --> 1:11:54.962
I can't.

1:11:55.049 --> 1:11:57.617
Oh, I don't know. Maybe
I'll head back to San Fran.

1:11:57.704 --> 1:12:01.229
Now there's nothing really
left for me here.

1:12:01.317 --> 1:12:02.448
You so sure
about that?

1:12:02.535 --> 1:12:04.798
Hey, Tipper. What's goin' on?

1:12:04.929 --> 1:12:08.541
Well, we got a call this morning
from the financial consultant

1:12:08.672 --> 1:12:10.369
who came to see this place
the other day.

1:12:10.500 --> 1:12:13.981
And, uh, his people
want to invest

1:12:14.112 --> 1:12:16.767
half of what this gold stock is
worth in our company,

1:12:16.854 --> 1:12:17.855
so...

1:12:19.247 --> 1:12:20.684
it's all yours.

1:12:20.771 --> 1:12:22.250
We can figure out the rest.

1:12:24.165 --> 1:12:26.429
Tipper, thank you,
but I-I, I can't take this.

1:12:26.516 --> 1:12:27.995
This was left for all of us.

1:12:28.082 --> 1:12:29.910
Look, at the end of the day,
you're the one

1:12:30.041 --> 1:12:31.956
who took care of Ms. Marley
until the end.

1:12:32.043 --> 1:12:35.699
I mean, we loved the Marley's
dearly, but, uh,

1:12:35.786 --> 1:12:38.310
she was like family to you.

1:12:38.397 --> 1:12:40.921
So if you want to bring this
place back to life,

1:12:41.008 --> 1:12:42.183
you have every right to.

1:12:45.796 --> 1:12:47.188
Okay, and one more thing.

1:12:47.275 --> 1:12:49.277
You know, it took Austin
a lot of courage

1:12:49.365 --> 1:12:51.062
to come back here
in the off chance

1:12:51.192 --> 1:12:52.629
that you'd be here
for the hunt.

1:12:52.759 --> 1:12:54.413
Even though I know he secretly
wanted to see you

1:12:54.500 --> 1:12:56.807
after all these years.

1:12:56.894 --> 1:12:59.984
But there's a part of me
that really wants Austin

1:13:00.114 --> 1:13:02.682
to leave here and never
speak to you again,

1:13:02.769 --> 1:13:05.076
because I don't want you to hurt
him like you did in the past.

1:13:07.818 --> 1:13:12.475
Last night, the Craig's told us
that the reason Ms. Marley

1:13:12.562 --> 1:13:14.912
brought this hunt back to life

1:13:14.999 --> 1:13:17.262
is because she wanted to bring
you two back together.

1:13:19.090 --> 1:13:21.222
I just thought you should know.

1:13:21.353 --> 1:13:23.529
And Austin made his parents
promise not to say anything,

1:13:23.660 --> 1:13:28.186
but he didn't make me promise
not to say anything.

1:13:28.316 --> 1:13:32.408
So I, I wanted to tell you
because, in my opinion,

1:13:32.538 --> 1:13:34.627
the only thing you should be
worried about bringing back

1:13:34.758 --> 1:13:38.892
to life is what you have
with Austin...

1:13:38.979 --> 1:13:40.416
before it's gone.

1:13:58.782 --> 1:13:59.913
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:01.393
Morning. Good morning.

1:14:01.480 --> 1:14:02.829
So...

1:14:02.916 --> 1:14:04.265
we figured out a way
to get people

1:14:04.352 --> 1:14:05.745
here for a carnival tonight.

1:14:05.832 --> 1:14:07.834
What? How?
It's already Christmas Eve.

1:14:07.921 --> 1:14:09.880
'Cause you're talking
to a PR genius.

1:14:09.967 --> 1:14:12.099
Well, being married to a famous
basketball player

1:14:12.186 --> 1:14:14.450
definitely helps.

1:14:14.580 --> 1:14:17.453
Well, we passed these out
all over town.

1:14:17.540 --> 1:14:21.108
Drove around all morning,
out them in mail boxes. So...

1:14:21.239 --> 1:14:27.375
So, I think we have a
party to prepare for.

1:14:27.463 --> 1:14:29.943
Oh, but wait. We don't even
have any stuff to make for...

1:14:31.162 --> 1:14:34.165
Yeah. You do, don't you?

1:14:34.252 --> 1:14:35.079
Of course you do.

1:14:35.209 --> 1:14:37.429
- Nice.
- Nice job!

1:14:37.516 --> 1:14:38.648
Wow.

1:14:40.563 --> 1:14:41.825
All right, let me help.

1:14:43.348 --> 1:14:44.958
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Ricky.

1:14:45.045 --> 1:14:46.569
What are we doin'?

1:14:46.699 --> 1:14:47.439
Just getting ready
for a little

1:14:47.570 --> 1:14:49.528
Christmas Eve party.

1:14:49.615 --> 1:14:52.444
Are you and Everett ready
to do this thing?

1:14:52.531 --> 1:14:55.578
Uh, Ev took his stuff
and went back to town.

1:14:55.708 --> 1:14:57.536
Honestly, I...

1:14:57.623 --> 1:14:59.190
I-I don't know
if he's coming back.

1:15:01.497 --> 1:15:03.716
You know what? It's okay.

1:15:03.803 --> 1:15:05.631
It's okay. We're gonna
do this thing without him.

1:15:05.718 --> 1:15:07.590
And we're gonna do it right...

1:15:07.720 --> 1:15:09.113
for the Marley's.

1:15:12.464 --> 1:15:15.815

feel pretty fly in this suit.

1:17:13.454 --> 1:17:14.499
Clay, you look fly
in any suit.

1:17:15.761 --> 1:17:17.023
Where are the ladies?

1:17:17.110 --> 1:17:18.416
Oh, ladies.

1:17:18.503 --> 1:17:20.374
Are you ready?

1:17:20.505 --> 1:17:24.204
Oh! Ai!

1:17:24.291 --> 1:17:27.207
Man! And I thought I just hid
all the candy canes

1:17:27.294 --> 1:17:28.208
for the treasure hunt.

1:17:28.339 --> 1:17:29.340
Oh, jeez, dad.

1:17:29.470 --> 1:17:32.386
Well, all righty.

1:17:32.473 --> 1:17:35.215
I think that we should probably
go get changed into some

1:17:35.302 --> 1:17:36.913
tacky sweaters at least,
what do you say, honey?

1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:38.915
Okay.

1:17:39.045 --> 1:17:42.092
If anybody's gonna show up,
it's going to be soon.

1:17:42.179 --> 1:17:45.878
Oh, um, honey.
Tipper mentioned that you're

1:17:45.965 --> 1:17:48.533
a little short on what you
needed to get started.

1:17:48.664 --> 1:17:50.666
So...

1:17:50.796 --> 1:17:53.407
- Merry Christmas!
- Oh, my! Mom!

1:17:53.494 --> 1:17:56.584
No! Mrs. Marley gave this
to you. I can't take--

1:17:56.672 --> 1:17:59.413
That's right. And we want to
invest it in the best investment

1:17:59.544 --> 1:18:00.850
we ever made.

1:18:04.244 --> 1:18:05.855
Thank you.

1:18:05.985 --> 1:18:07.465
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1:18:07.552 --> 1:18:08.814
Thank you.

1:18:11.730 --> 1:18:13.036
Have fun.

1:18:22.219 --> 1:18:23.960
I guess we're just missing
one thing, huh?

1:18:24.090 --> 1:18:26.789
Aww. Come here.

1:18:29.574 --> 1:18:30.662
You all right?

1:18:30.793 --> 1:18:32.229
Y-yes. Yes.

1:18:32.316 --> 1:18:34.927
I'm fine. I'm always fine.

1:18:35.058 --> 1:18:38.278
- We're proud of you, you know?
- Why?

1:18:38.409 --> 1:18:39.192
In high school,
you were always

1:18:39.323 --> 1:18:40.585
a bit go-with-the-flow.

1:18:40.716 --> 1:18:42.500
You never really
asserted yourself.

1:18:42.587 --> 1:18:44.632
Never much spoke
out of turn...

1:18:44.720 --> 1:18:46.243
I think you always knew
who you were,

1:18:46.330 --> 1:18:48.898
but now you make sure that
everyone knows it too.

1:18:50.813 --> 1:18:52.858
She's right, Austin.

1:18:52.945 --> 1:18:56.427
Yeah, we're really proud of what
you two have accomplished.

1:18:56.514 --> 1:18:57.907
We just want to be there
for you guys.

1:18:59.169 --> 1:19:01.475
- You do? Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

1:19:01.606 --> 1:19:03.477
Well, then...

1:19:03.564 --> 1:19:06.698
what if you guys came
to our big influencer's

1:19:06.829 --> 1:19:08.874
New Year's Eve party, huh?

1:19:08.961 --> 1:19:10.397
It's going to be an amazing
party, I promise.

1:19:10.484 --> 1:19:12.225
And tons of swag.

1:19:12.312 --> 1:19:14.010
Yes, you guys have a big
following, which would only

1:19:14.097 --> 1:19:16.403
help our cause,
but it'd also be really fun.

1:19:18.101 --> 1:19:20.930
Well, I don't have anything
until the 4th,

1:19:21.017 --> 1:19:22.801
so I'm sure we could manage.

1:19:22.888 --> 1:19:24.107
You bet.

1:19:24.237 --> 1:19:26.762
- We are in.
- Yay!

1:19:26.849 --> 1:19:28.938
Wait, so I think
that just leaves

1:19:29.068 --> 1:19:31.984
one more invite for old Ricky.

1:19:32.115 --> 1:19:33.420
Oh! Mmm!

1:19:36.119 --> 1:19:37.468
I'm so happy you're coming.

1:19:40.384 --> 1:19:41.428
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

1:19:41.559 --> 1:19:43.691
- Let me just fix this.
- Thanks.

1:19:45.302 --> 1:19:47.173
Fine.

1:19:47.304 --> 1:19:49.567
Um, so do you have
any new year's plans?

1:19:49.697 --> 1:19:51.438
Ah, no. Not really.

1:19:51.525 --> 1:19:53.223
Uh, maybe just game
with my folks.

1:19:53.353 --> 1:19:55.660
What would you say if I told you
we were hosting

1:19:55.747 --> 1:19:59.707
an influencer party in LA
and you were invited?

1:19:59.795 --> 1:20:02.319
- Are you gonna be there?
- Of course.

1:20:02.449 --> 1:20:03.624
Yeah.

1:20:03.711 --> 1:20:05.104
Yeah, I'll go to your party.

1:20:05.235 --> 1:20:06.976
But, only as your date.

1:20:09.195 --> 1:20:12.372
You, Mr. Trevino,
have become quite the charmer.

1:20:14.505 --> 1:20:18.291

- I can't believe you did that.
- Welcome. Good to see you.

1:20:33.350 --> 1:20:35.743
One, two, three.

1:20:37.615 --> 1:20:39.312
- You want another one?
- I would love another one.

1:20:39.443 --> 1:20:40.836
Okay, let's get one.

1:20:45.144 --> 1:20:46.972
- Hey.
- Hey. Arnold Palmer?

1:20:47.103 --> 1:20:49.540
No, thank you. I'll have
something stronger I think.

1:20:49.627 --> 1:20:52.021
- Okay. They're really good. I...
- I'm sure.

1:20:56.503 --> 1:20:57.591
- That's, uh...
- Merry Christmas.

1:20:57.722 --> 1:20:59.637
Happy holidays!

1:20:59.767 --> 1:21:01.552
- Hey.
- Everett.

1:21:01.639 --> 1:21:04.772
Oh! Merry Christmas!

1:21:04.860 --> 1:21:07.775
- Merry Christmas, son.
- Thank you.

1:21:07.863 --> 1:21:09.865
I just want to say, I mean,

1:21:09.995 --> 1:21:12.215
I'm really sorry with how
everything went down last night.

1:21:12.302 --> 1:21:16.132
Oh, you hush. You do not need to
apologize to us.

1:21:16.262 --> 1:21:18.525
You're family, and we just
want you to be happy...

1:21:18.612 --> 1:21:20.179
whatever that is.

1:21:20.266 --> 1:21:23.182
Only, we think you'd be
a lot happier

1:21:23.313 --> 1:21:25.097
if it was with our son.

1:21:25.228 --> 1:21:27.317
Yeah, well, that is
if you'll still have me.

1:21:27.404 --> 1:21:28.796
- Oh.
-"Will?"

1:21:28.884 --> 1:21:30.886
There's only one way to
find out.

1:21:34.628 --> 1:21:36.979
- Everett! Oh, you made it.
- Oh, look at this.

1:21:37.066 --> 1:21:39.546
Great.

1:21:39.633 --> 1:21:41.505
Ah, we really thought you
Irish Goodbye-d us

1:21:41.592 --> 1:21:42.941
after you found that
pot o' gold.

1:21:44.595 --> 1:21:45.944
Actually, I do have
some good news.

1:21:46.031 --> 1:21:47.641
I just, I gotta talk
to Austin first.

1:21:47.772 --> 1:21:49.817
Have any of you seen
where he went?

1:21:49.905 --> 1:21:52.342
I haven't, but wherever
you're going,

1:21:52.472 --> 1:21:53.734
you are gonna need this.

1:21:55.388 --> 1:21:56.259
Yeah.

1:21:57.521 --> 1:21:58.609
Wish me luck.

1:21:59.784 --> 1:22:01.786
Good luck.

1:22:01.873 --> 1:22:04.354
Doesn't need luck, he needs
a Christmas miracle.

1:22:04.441 --> 1:22:06.834
Lookin' all cut in that bow tie
and suspenders?

1:22:06.922 --> 1:22:09.707
Nah-ah.
He's ready to slay bells.

1:22:09.837 --> 1:22:12.362
Oh, my God! Oh, for the record,
I just want to say

1:22:12.492 --> 1:22:15.060
that regardless of what
happens between them,

1:22:15.147 --> 1:22:18.585
this has been the most
epic Christmas.

1:22:18.672 --> 1:22:20.587
It certainly has.

1:22:20.718 --> 1:22:23.590
And I have a feeling it's about
to get a bit more epic.

1:22:23.677 --> 1:22:26.854
This is the best Candy Cane
Carnival ever.

1:22:26.942 --> 1:22:29.074
To the Marley's.
I'll toast to that!

1:22:29.161 --> 1:22:30.858
- To the Marley's.
- Yes. To the Marley's.

1:22:30.946 --> 1:22:32.077
<i>- Salut.</i>
- Salut.

1:22:49.660 --> 1:22:53.359
So, w-when I'm finished you can,
you can totally send me away.

1:22:53.446 --> 1:22:55.144
I just...

1:22:55.274 --> 1:22:57.450
I just really would like
to say something.

1:22:57.581 --> 1:22:58.974
Fine. I'm listening.

1:23:02.934 --> 1:23:04.849
So I told you that I told my
parents that I was gay,

1:23:04.980 --> 1:23:08.244
but what I didn't tell you
is how they,

1:23:08.331 --> 1:23:09.506
they actually took the news.

1:23:11.247 --> 1:23:14.772
We didn't speak much for...

1:23:14.902 --> 1:23:17.296
quite a long bit there.

1:23:17.383 --> 1:23:21.779
But then in their last year,
they just... changed.

1:23:21.866 --> 1:23:23.520
They said they realized
how short life is.

1:23:25.739 --> 1:23:28.046
They even apologized for waiting
so long to come around.

1:23:28.133 --> 1:23:31.180
And, and for all the time
that we missed out on.

1:23:33.051 --> 1:23:34.966
They said their only hope
for was that

1:23:35.053 --> 1:23:37.621
I found happiness.

1:23:37.708 --> 1:23:39.579
And I found it with someone who,

1:23:39.666 --> 1:23:41.146
who made me as happy
as you did.

1:23:44.758 --> 1:23:48.371
I am sorry that you lost out
on time at all

1:23:48.458 --> 1:23:50.677
with them or for yourself.

1:23:50.764 --> 1:23:53.593
Yeah, well, I'm just... I'm glad
we got a few good moments

1:23:53.724 --> 1:23:55.900
there in the end.

1:23:55.987 --> 1:23:57.032
My only regret is that

1:23:57.162 --> 1:23:58.511
I just didn't tell them sooner.

1:23:59.556 --> 1:24:00.600
You know, 'cause

1:24:00.687 --> 1:24:02.733
maybe if I had, then,

1:24:02.820 --> 1:24:04.343
then I wouldn't have
let my fear get in the way

1:24:04.430 --> 1:24:05.910
of me telling you
that I love you.

1:24:07.303 --> 1:24:09.653
I mean, the truth is, I...

1:24:09.783 --> 1:24:12.177
I didn't know what love
felt like until I had gone.

1:24:12.308 --> 1:24:13.918
Until we were apart.

1:24:16.225 --> 1:24:18.531
I mean, we were,
we were best friends.

1:24:22.144 --> 1:24:24.189
All I can remember is that

1:24:24.320 --> 1:24:27.192
at some point we were
looking at each other and...

1:24:28.976 --> 1:24:30.935
both of us knew
it was more than that.

1:24:33.285 --> 1:24:35.200
So...

1:24:35.287 --> 1:24:36.767
And ever since I left,
I just...

1:24:36.897 --> 1:24:38.029
that's what I've been
wanting to say.

1:24:38.116 --> 1:24:40.118
So, that's it.

1:24:40.205 --> 1:24:42.816
Um, I guess I never did pick up
the phone to hear you say it,

1:24:42.903 --> 1:24:43.904
did I?

1:24:45.950 --> 1:24:48.300
So I guess we each have
one big regret.

1:24:51.651 --> 1:24:53.218
Who knows...

1:24:53.305 --> 1:24:54.872
maybe.

1:24:54.959 --> 1:24:56.439
Just maybe we could
call it even now, huh?

1:25:10.844 --> 1:25:13.586
I just got one question
about this Marley situation.

1:25:13.717 --> 1:25:16.894
Um, so, what... where does that
leave things with us?

1:25:17.024 --> 1:25:19.201
You know? Because I can't really
do long distance.

1:25:19.288 --> 1:25:21.420
All right, fine.

1:25:21.507 --> 1:25:23.553
You don't have to.

1:25:23.683 --> 1:25:26.251
This afternoon, I, uh,
spent time with Ricky's boss

1:25:26.382 --> 1:25:27.992
down at the city
planning office.

1:25:28.079 --> 1:25:31.604
I'm donating the, the gold stock
certificate to the town.

1:25:31.735 --> 1:25:35.042
Well, if and only if they turn
this place into a public park,

1:25:35.130 --> 1:25:37.784
and-and keep the house
as a historical landmark.

1:25:37.871 --> 1:25:42.528
You know, for snow-shoeing
and carnivals or whatever.

1:25:42.615 --> 1:25:44.051
Ricky can oversee, so...

1:25:44.139 --> 1:25:45.879
So, yeah, I can go.

1:25:45.966 --> 1:25:47.620
And if Ricky and Tipper
work out?

1:25:47.707 --> 1:25:49.361
Well... [chuckles] Well, then
I'm sure your parents

1:25:49.448 --> 1:25:51.450
would, would love to have
some fun with this place

1:25:51.581 --> 1:25:52.538
now that they're retired.

1:25:52.625 --> 1:25:54.453
Okay, okay.

1:25:54.540 --> 1:25:56.673
But does this also mean
that I have a date

1:25:56.803 --> 1:25:58.936
to my company's
big New Year's Eve bash?

1:25:59.023 --> 1:26:00.807
Because the whole gang is comin'

1:26:00.894 --> 1:26:04.246
and I do not want to be
a fifth wheel.

1:26:04.376 --> 1:26:05.160
Are you kiddin'?

1:26:07.292 --> 1:26:09.425
I'll be your kiss
this new year's...

1:26:09.512 --> 1:26:10.687
and every one after.
