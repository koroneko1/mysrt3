00:06.000 --> 00:12.074


03:58.155 --> 03:59.905
Think of it, Thing.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.531
For 25 years,

04:03.702 --> 04:06.582
we've attempted to contact Fester
in the great beyond,

04:06.746 --> 04:09.416
and for 25 years,

04:09.916 --> 04:10.956
nothing.

04:12.419 --> 04:15.879
I'm beginning to think
my brother truly is lost.

04:26.224 --> 04:29.144
Don't be a baby. I know what I'm doing.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.482
Help me.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.746
Look at her.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.792
I would die for her.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.581
I would kill for her.

04:55.086 --> 04:56.706
Either way, what bliss.

05:03.386 --> 05:06.596
- Unhappy, darling?
- Oh, yes.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.386
Yes, completely.

05:17.526 --> 05:18.726
Gomez,

05:20.278 --> 05:21.568
the sun.

05:24.241 --> 05:27.741
Oh, Tish, that's French.

05:28.119 --> 05:29.159
Oui.

05:31.456 --> 05:32.496
Cara Mia.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.879
En Garde, monsieur Soleil.

05:41.508 --> 05:42.758
Gomez?

05:43.134 --> 05:44.184
Querida.

05:44.511 --> 05:47.561
Last night you were unhinged.

05:48.557 --> 05:51.387
You were like some
desperate howling demon.

05:51.935 --> 05:53.635
You frightened me.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.234
Do it again.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.201
Thank you, Lurch.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.447
Damn you, Addams!

06:45.864 --> 06:47.744
Sorry about the window, Judge.

06:47.907 --> 06:50.617
Keep the ball. I have a whole bucketful.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.418
You moron!

07:00.587 --> 07:02.497
It is a milestone, Tish.

07:02.672 --> 07:05.262
This very night, our 25th séance.

07:06.926 --> 07:10.346
All those years, gnawed by guilt,

07:11.222 --> 07:12.812
undone by woe,

07:13.600 --> 07:16.770
burning with uncertainty.

07:18.813 --> 07:21.023
Don't torture yourself, Gomez.

07:22.817 --> 07:24.317
That's my job.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.612
Oh, Tish.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.452
Imagine, darling,
if Fester did come back.

07:32.160 --> 07:35.790
Half alive, barely human,
a rotting shell.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.916
Don't tease.

07:51.012 --> 07:52.932
Stop it! I'm warning you.

07:58.978 --> 08:00.768
Look, darling. Tully is here.

08:02.524 --> 08:04.784
- Tully!
- Romping with Gate.

08:07.112 --> 08:09.822
These are your last paying clients,
may I remind you?

08:09.989 --> 08:12.369
- If it gives you pleasure.
- Something has to.

08:12.534 --> 08:15.744
Like a decent coat,
something dressy, for evening.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.872
Ask for a loan. Beg!

08:18.039 --> 08:20.039
No loans. I am not a bum.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.713
Don't say it. I'll get the money.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.167
I have a plan.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.341
This is all so humiliating.

08:26.506 --> 08:29.586
- Why did I marry you?
- Because I said yes.

08:30.218 --> 08:33.888
I'm here to see Mrs. Addams
about the charity auction.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.063
Stop! Let go!

09:02.375 --> 09:04.205
- Missed!
- What's that?

09:11.217 --> 09:13.087
Dirty pool, old man.

09:13.762 --> 09:15.102
I like it.

09:26.941 --> 09:28.321
Had enough?

09:34.449 --> 09:35.989
Where's my pen?

09:36.951 --> 09:39.241
Never mind. I'll take yours.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.546
First, the old business.

09:50.089 --> 09:53.049
Charity auction, it's ridiculous!

09:54.594 --> 09:57.814
- Perhaps it's in here.
- I don't think so.

10:04.062 --> 10:06.612
"Uncle Niknak's winter wardrobe."

10:12.487 --> 10:14.947
"Uncle Niknak's summer wardrobe."

10:18.243 --> 10:19.793
"Uncle Niknak."

10:22.413 --> 10:25.753
"The Fester Addams
Offshore Retirement Fund?"

10:26.251 --> 10:28.921
- What would it do?
- What wouldn't it do?

10:29.087 --> 10:31.957
Fester, all tribute to thee.

10:32.131 --> 10:34.761
- Some called him inhumanly evil.
- No!

10:34.926 --> 10:37.926
Only our parents. I called him brother.

10:38.096 --> 10:41.766
And his memory must live on forever
through money.

10:42.141 --> 10:45.441
I'm gonna deposit the funds
under my name for tax purposes.

10:45.603 --> 10:46.813
That's inspired.

10:46.980 --> 10:50.270
He would've wanted it that way.
Beloved Fester.

10:52.277 --> 10:53.567
Indeed!

10:55.154 --> 10:57.614
- For Fester!
- For Fester! A brother!

10:57.782 --> 10:59.202
- My brother!
- One of a kind!

10:59.367 --> 11:02.407
- The doctors all said...
- Kind to animals, so good with children!

11:02.579 --> 11:05.409
- They never proved anything.
- $1 million is the perfect amount.

11:05.582 --> 11:08.042
- It's brilliant.
- It's untraceable!

11:10.920 --> 11:13.130
But, Tully, it's not old business.

11:13.298 --> 11:15.818
It's going to have to wait.
You know the rules better than that.

11:15.925 --> 11:19.385
Why? But this is different.
This is in my name. Make an exception!

11:19.554 --> 11:22.434
Old business is old business
and new business is new business

11:22.599 --> 11:23.929
and this is new business

11:24.100 --> 11:26.980
and we do not discuss
new business until

11:31.149 --> 11:32.649
next quarter.

11:32.817 --> 11:36.027
Next quarter?

11:38.406 --> 11:42.486
Fine lunge, but your riposte,
a tad rusty.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.251
Make yourself comfortable, old man,

11:48.416 --> 11:51.496
while I get the money
for the monthly expenses.

12:15.109 --> 12:18.609
There it is.
Just what we've been searching for.

12:19.614 --> 12:21.244
Thank you, Thing.

12:23.493 --> 12:26.583
My God, what is it?

12:26.913 --> 12:29.543
A finger trap
from the court of Emperor Wu.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.827
It must be worth a fortune.

12:32.585 --> 12:37.085
Oh, Morticia! This is too extravagant!

12:38.675 --> 12:40.045
Even for the auction.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.260
Let's keep it.

12:42.762 --> 12:47.182
Hush, Mama. It's for charity.
Widows and orphans.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.774
We need more of them.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.270
Margaret?

12:53.690 --> 12:55.690
About the séance tonight.

12:56.442 --> 13:00.362
I wish you'd come. It's Gomez,
I'm terribly worried about him.

13:01.239 --> 13:03.739
He won't eat. He can't sleep.

13:04.742 --> 13:06.912
He keeps coughing up blood.

13:07.829 --> 13:09.579
He coughs up blood?

13:10.873 --> 13:12.963
Well, not like he used to.

13:16.671 --> 13:18.091
Down, kitty!

13:53.583 --> 13:56.133
There, the monthly expenses.

14:05.136 --> 14:06.636
Miss Bradbury.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.100
Miss Bradbury!

14:11.267 --> 14:15.727
- She's gone home, Mr. Alford.
- Oh, Mrs. Craven!

14:16.689 --> 14:19.979
- I was just about to call you.
- I'm certain you were.

14:20.151 --> 14:23.531
You haven't met my son Gordon,
have you, Mr. Alford?

14:24.614 --> 14:25.784
Hello.

14:28.951 --> 14:32.871
Is this the one, Mother?
That deadbeat you mentioned?

14:34.707 --> 14:36.018
No, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

14:36.042 --> 14:39.252
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
You have to listen to me.

14:39.420 --> 14:42.050
Do we, Mr. Alford? And why?

14:42.465 --> 14:44.255
Please, hear me out!

14:45.885 --> 14:47.295
Hear me out!

14:47.595 --> 14:49.635
Please. Please!

14:50.932 --> 14:52.182
Your call, Mother.

14:52.350 --> 14:55.640
Gordon and I
enjoy a very special relationship.

14:55.812 --> 14:58.612
- She's a pip!
- Refreshing, no?

14:58.773 --> 15:00.733
- Down, Gordon.
- Mother?

15:00.900 --> 15:02.480
- Gordon.
- Gordon!

15:05.029 --> 15:08.819
We've lent you a considerable sum,
many thousands of dollars.

15:09.075 --> 15:10.075
Payment due.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.554
I don't have the money to repay you.
I've tried everything.

15:12.578 --> 15:16.368
- Oh, Gordon, I want to believe him.
- So do I.

15:16.541 --> 15:17.711
Make me proud.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.575
No, no, no, no, no.

15:27.635 --> 15:30.795
- He lied to us, Mother.
- No, no. It's not what you think.

15:30.972 --> 15:33.062
Those are doubloons
for the Addams account.

15:33.224 --> 15:34.274
Addams?

15:34.433 --> 15:36.813
There's more, there's a fortune,
but nobody can get to it.

15:36.978 --> 15:38.098
Don't you think I've tried?

15:38.271 --> 15:40.941
Have you? Have you tried hard enough?

15:41.107 --> 15:44.777
- Ask him, sweetheart.
- No, no, no, sweetheart. Don't ask.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.120
Fester.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.753
- It's a miserable night.
- I know, darling.

16:04.463 --> 16:06.053
Séance weather.

16:07.425 --> 16:09.755
Children, we're starting!

16:10.094 --> 16:12.054
Put down that antenna.

16:18.895 --> 16:22.685
It's unbelievable.
This hideous creature and my little boy.

16:26.068 --> 16:27.858
They could be twins.

16:28.529 --> 16:32.119
But they're his family. What
makes you think they'll fall for it?

16:32.283 --> 16:34.993
You shave your head, we dress you up.
No problem.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.139
They'll think he's Fester,
their long-lost brother.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.163
I hope so, Mr. Alford, for your sake.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.252
Hey, I've been the Addams' lawyer
for years.

16:41.417 --> 16:43.497
- They're morons.
- Obviously.

16:43.669 --> 16:46.023
- Now what about the gold?
- They got this vault, it's somewhere...

16:46.047 --> 16:47.627
- Where?
- I'm not sure.

16:47.798 --> 16:49.668
That's a problem, isn't it?

16:49.842 --> 16:52.552
Now listen,
Fester's been missing for 25 years.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.430
He and Gomez had some sort of a fight

16:54.597 --> 16:57.017
and Gomez feels
incredibly guilty about it.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.023
He'll tell you anything. Just ask.

16:59.310 --> 17:02.730
- It's foolproof.
- It had better be. Now, get out.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.319
It's gonna be great.

17:05.483 --> 17:08.323
You're gonna get back
all the money I owe you and more.

17:08.486 --> 17:09.736
You'll see. Really.

17:12.114 --> 17:15.743
This is it, Mother.
The one we've been waiting for.

17:15.910 --> 17:20.250
No more loan sharking,
no more storefront scams.

17:20.414 --> 17:22.674
I get the gold, and we're gone.

17:22.833 --> 17:26.093
And Tully takes the rap.
Gordon, it's brilliant.

17:26.253 --> 17:27.924
No, not Gordon!

17:28.339 --> 17:30.879
- Of course not.
- Fester.

17:38.683 --> 17:41.353
Big night for you guys, eh, small fry?

17:43.271 --> 17:44.941
Hello, sweetheart.

17:45.856 --> 17:47.226
Could you?

17:52.405 --> 17:54.905
Oh, thank God.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.408
Welcome, honored guests.

17:59.245 --> 18:00.535
Entrails?

18:15.344 --> 18:19.314
Sing, O spirits, hearken all souls.

18:20.141 --> 18:21.521
Every year on this date,

18:21.684 --> 18:24.604
we offer a clarion call
to Fester Addams.

18:24.770 --> 18:25.940
Stop it.

18:26.397 --> 18:27.647
Pugsley.

18:32.486 --> 18:33.606
Kids.

18:34.572 --> 18:36.782
From generation to generation,

18:37.616 --> 18:39.656
our beacon to the beyond.

18:41.579 --> 18:44.329
All close eyes and join hands.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.301
What a grip!

18:53.591 --> 18:54.801
My hand!

18:56.093 --> 18:58.803
My hand! She's got my hand!

19:07.730 --> 19:09.940
- Excuse me.
- Okay, pumpkin, sit down.

19:10.107 --> 19:13.187
- Join the fun.
- Mama, you should know better.

19:14.111 --> 19:16.151
Thing, you're a handful.

19:16.697 --> 19:18.067
Wednesday.

19:18.741 --> 19:21.411
Let us ransom you
from the power of the grave.

19:21.577 --> 19:24.327
Tonight, O Death, let us be your plague.

19:24.914 --> 19:26.214
Mama.

19:26.374 --> 19:28.214
Fester Addams,

19:35.424 --> 19:37.474
I feel that he's near.

19:40.137 --> 19:43.387
Fester Addams, gather your strength

19:44.308 --> 19:46.728
and knock three times.

19:51.315 --> 19:52.685
Did you hear that?

19:53.275 --> 19:55.185
- Ask again, Mama, quickly.
- By all means.

19:55.361 --> 19:56.531
Ask. Ask.

19:56.695 --> 20:01.905
Fester Addams,
I demand that you knock again!

20:14.422 --> 20:16.052
He's at the door!

20:32.022 --> 20:33.732
- Could it be?
- Is it him?

20:33.899 --> 20:36.029
- Is it possible?
- Oh, my God.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.741
- Fester.
- Gomez.

21:00.134 --> 21:03.394
Good evening. I am Dr. Pinder-Schloss.

21:07.725 --> 21:11.685
He was found in Miami,
tangled in a tuna net.

21:11.854 --> 21:16.074
It was just last month
during the Hurricane Helga.

21:16.400 --> 21:19.360
The sky, it was black like pitch.

21:19.528 --> 21:23.738
The waves, they were walls of doom.
Can you imagine?

21:23.908 --> 21:27.238
They drag him from the ocean,
from the very jaws of oblivion.

21:27.411 --> 21:32.421
I'm telling you.
There were tests, so many tests!

21:32.625 --> 21:36.455
A complete psychological profile.

21:36.795 --> 21:37.915
At long last,

21:38.088 --> 21:40.628
the Florida Department
of the Fish and the Game,

21:40.799 --> 21:44.429
they say, "Lo and behold,
oh, my, oh, my, oh, my",

21:44.595 --> 21:46.965
"go tell it on the mountains,"

21:47.806 --> 21:49.556
"he is your brother."

21:51.894 --> 21:55.524
Boom! They give him to me
at Human Services,

21:55.689 --> 21:59.439
and I am bringing him,
after all these years,

21:59.735 --> 22:02.235
after who knows what heartache,

22:02.404 --> 22:04.744
after the naked and the dead,

22:04.907 --> 22:07.907
I am bringing him home to you!

22:08.536 --> 22:10.246
- That's preposterous.
- Margaret...

22:10.412 --> 22:12.572
Isn't that the most ridiculous thing
you've ever heard?

22:12.665 --> 22:14.865
- Possibly...
- It certainly is.

22:17.753 --> 22:19.963
- Now you're back.
- Yes, back.

22:20.130 --> 22:23.170
Back to share your joys, your sorrows.

22:23.342 --> 22:26.512
- Hey, everything.
- Well, I just don't know.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.759
Honey, how does this work, again?

22:28.931 --> 22:31.061
An infant would understand.

22:34.019 --> 22:37.479
Fester Addams, home at long last.

22:37.856 --> 22:41.476
Well, at least for a week.

22:41.652 --> 22:44.862
- A week?
- Don't be ridiculous. You're home.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.740
Sorry, but I have to get back.

22:46.907 --> 22:50.487
I've got a lot of things cooking
in the Bermuda Triangle.

22:50.661 --> 22:52.001
Oh, Gomez.

22:52.663 --> 22:55.503
- The Bermuda Triangle.
- Devil's Island.

22:55.666 --> 22:57.666
The Black Hole of Calcutta.

22:57.835 --> 23:00.835
- Excuse us.
- Second honeymoon.

23:02.256 --> 23:05.626
Dr. Pinder-Schloss,
will you be staying with us, too?

23:06.093 --> 23:08.263
No, no. I must be going.

23:08.429 --> 23:12.809
But I will be back, you can bet,
to be checking on Fester's adjustment.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.226
Cool.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.854
Nobody gets out of
the Bermuda Triangle.

23:18.022 --> 23:19.902
Not even for a vacation.

23:20.065 --> 23:21.565
Everyone knows that.

23:21.734 --> 23:25.494
Oh, my little bundle.
So much you don't understand.

23:25.654 --> 23:29.414
The human spirit,
it is a hard thing to kill.

23:30.326 --> 23:32.536
Even with a chain saw.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.260
Unpacking? Let me.

23:44.923 --> 23:47.053
It's all right. I can do it.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.590
Crowbar.

23:54.016 --> 23:55.216
Dynamite.

24:02.358 --> 24:03.688
Cyanide.

24:06.737 --> 24:09.907
Fester, as if we'd run out.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.656
Good night.

24:47.611 --> 24:49.281
Nosy little brat.

25:51.258 --> 25:52.718
Who's there?

26:28.587 --> 26:31.087
My own dear brother.

26:33.133 --> 26:36.723
- I've got goose bumps.
- I know.

26:38.222 --> 26:42.562
Screams in the night,
it can only mean one thing.

26:44.603 --> 26:45.943
He's home.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.900
Please! Please!

26:51.068 --> 26:53.568
Leave me alone!

27:20.639 --> 27:21.969
Breakfast?

27:23.600 --> 27:26.600
Damn, it's good to have you back.
Let's go.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.268
Two out of three?

27:36.405 --> 27:38.235
Home cooking!

27:38.407 --> 27:41.237
There's nothing like it in the world.

27:41.702 --> 27:43.492
May I have the salt?

27:45.539 --> 27:47.159
What do we say?

27:48.500 --> 27:49.580
Now.

27:59.511 --> 28:03.601
- What is this?
- Mama's spécialité de la Maison.

28:03.932 --> 28:05.642
Oh, Tish.

28:08.395 --> 28:10.185
Start with the eyes.

28:12.733 --> 28:14.573
Did you sleep well?

28:16.028 --> 28:18.238
- Like the dead.
- Really?

28:18.405 --> 28:20.085
Who would have thought
the Bermuda Triangle

28:20.198 --> 28:21.658
could change a man so much?

28:21.825 --> 28:25.905
You used to toss and turn all night.
We had to chain you to the bedpost.

28:26.079 --> 28:27.869
Doesn't make sense.

28:29.249 --> 28:33.879
The Bermuda Triangle is a very strange
and mysterious place.

28:34.504 --> 28:37.724
You'd be surprised
at all the things you don't know.

28:39.217 --> 28:40.887
She certainly would.

28:41.053 --> 28:43.473
Wednesday adores
the Bermuda Triangle.

28:43.639 --> 28:46.809
She studies it.
Death at sea, she's hooked.

28:47.017 --> 28:48.637
Ask me anything.

28:52.356 --> 28:55.396
Being in my old room
sure brings back memories.

28:56.735 --> 29:00.065
- Remember Camp Custer?
- For preteen offenders.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.581
Aren't memories precious?

29:12.084 --> 29:15.594
Today I'd like to wander
through the house, remembering.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.964
No, no. Sorry, old man.
No wandering today.

29:18.131 --> 29:20.551
Today we're going straight to the vault.

29:30.727 --> 29:33.267
Bravo, Pugsley!

29:39.403 --> 29:40.743
- "Greed"!
- "Greed"!

29:49.287 --> 29:51.747
I feel like we're children again.

29:51.957 --> 29:53.497
Tag. You're it!

30:16.231 --> 30:18.481
Smell that air, Fester.

30:22.237 --> 30:23.607
Like a tomb.

30:30.787 --> 30:33.327
The sea, your second home.

30:34.624 --> 30:36.134
Ship ahoy.

30:51.767 --> 30:53.927
Do you think that's really Uncle Fester?

30:54.102 --> 30:57.102
Father says so,
but I think Mother isn't sure.

31:01.109 --> 31:02.399
Pugsley, sit in the chair.

31:02.569 --> 31:04.739
- Why?
- So we can play a game.

31:10.243 --> 31:11.583
What game?

31:12.871 --> 31:16.421
It's called, "Is There a God?"

31:41.233 --> 31:42.613
The vault!

31:44.069 --> 31:47.529
Two to the right, ten to the left.

31:47.697 --> 31:50.317
And then around to...

31:50.867 --> 31:51.947
Five.

31:52.869 --> 31:54.079
Eleven.

31:55.038 --> 31:58.038
Two, ten, eleven. Eyes, fingers, toes.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.250
So many years.

32:10.095 --> 32:12.555
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.

32:13.723 --> 32:15.723
Our secret place.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.727
If these walls could speak, eh, old man?

32:21.898 --> 32:25.898
- What would they say?
- You tell me.

32:26.736 --> 32:28.066
You first.

32:29.072 --> 32:30.572
Senior partner.

32:31.366 --> 32:32.906
Junior spaceman.

32:35.036 --> 32:36.786
First a brandy. Do the honors.

32:36.955 --> 32:39.075
I've got a real treat in store.

32:39.249 --> 32:41.829
Where is it, you ridiculous imbecile?

33:27.047 --> 33:28.837
Show time!

33:58.703 --> 34:01.123
There, the debutante ball.

34:02.624 --> 34:04.794
Remember that fateful night?

34:05.752 --> 34:07.092
Of course.

34:12.467 --> 34:13.877
Your first cigar.

34:14.052 --> 34:17.391
What? Come on, old man.
I've smoked since I was five.

34:17.554 --> 34:19.215
Mother insisted.

34:21.393 --> 34:24.193
Flora and Fauna.

34:24.478 --> 34:26.899
Quite the pair, eh, Gomez?

34:27.232 --> 34:28.982
Can you ever forgive me?

34:30.860 --> 34:31.900
What?

34:32.362 --> 34:34.322
I didn't love them,

34:34.489 --> 34:37.739
yet I wooed them both
out of foolish pride.

34:38.702 --> 34:41.371
You were so dashing,
you could have any woman you wanted,

34:41.538 --> 34:43.038
dead or alive.

34:43.665 --> 34:45.114
I was jealous.

34:45.292 --> 34:47.502
Insanely jealous.

34:47.668 --> 34:49.379
I admit that now.

34:52.465 --> 34:55.215
But I did not mean to drive you off,

34:55.385 --> 34:57.545
not to the Bermuda Triangle.

34:58.054 --> 34:59.894
Water under the bridge.

35:00.390 --> 35:02.520
Forgiven. Forgotten.

35:10.233 --> 35:12.073
Come on. Say it.

35:12.902 --> 35:15.612
- Say the secret password.
- The password?

35:16.406 --> 35:18.566
Come on. Stop fooling. You remember.

35:18.742 --> 35:21.662
Please. I'm choking. Please.

35:21.828 --> 35:24.538
You forgot our secret password?

35:24.706 --> 35:27.076
The word we used 100 times a day?

35:27.250 --> 35:29.380
Our special private name
for each other?

35:29.544 --> 35:31.714
That was a long time ago
when we were children.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.210
You almost killed me,

35:33.381 --> 35:37.221
you demented freak.

35:37.385 --> 35:40.715
Poor devil, what did they do to you
in that Bermuda Triangle?

35:40.889 --> 35:43.389
But if he's not Uncle Fester,
then who is he?

35:43.558 --> 35:45.058
Somebody else.

35:48.146 --> 35:49.396
It has to warm up.

35:49.564 --> 35:52.654
- Why?
- So it can kill you.

35:53.276 --> 35:54.776
I knew that.

35:55.612 --> 35:59.282
- Children, what are you doing?
- I'm going to electrocute him.

35:59.449 --> 36:01.579
But we're late for the charity auction.

36:01.743 --> 36:04.293
- But, Mother...
- I said no.

36:04.913 --> 36:06.123
Please?

36:07.082 --> 36:08.582
Oh, all right.

36:18.426 --> 36:19.836
This magnificent piece

36:20.428 --> 36:24.008
is encrusted with rubies
and 15 emerald chips.

36:24.349 --> 36:29.599
It was donated
by Morticia and Gomez Addams.

36:29.854 --> 36:32.364
Remember, this year,
over half our proceeds

36:32.524 --> 36:35.654
will benefit the elderly
and the mentally disabled.

36:36.319 --> 36:39.409
I'll open the bidding at $5,000.

36:39.572 --> 36:42.202
Five... Not good enough.

36:42.367 --> 36:44.577
- $20,000.
- What are they doing?

36:44.744 --> 36:47.414
- I have 20.
- Twenty-five.

36:48.123 --> 36:49.463
Twenty-five.

36:49.624 --> 36:50.874
Thirty.

36:52.001 --> 36:53.421
Thirty-five!

36:55.463 --> 36:59.383
- Fifty.
- I have $50,000.

36:59.551 --> 37:00.931
Your turn, my ecstasy.

37:01.094 --> 37:04.684
$50,000, going once.
$50,000, going twice.

37:06.516 --> 37:10.936
Sold to Morticia Addams for $50,000.

37:22.407 --> 37:24.367
Isn't it too enchanting?

37:24.534 --> 37:26.414
How do you take it off?

37:29.205 --> 37:31.165
There's a trick to it,

37:33.543 --> 37:34.923
of course.

37:45.263 --> 37:48.063
"How do you take it off?" That's absurd.

37:48.391 --> 37:51.891
That finger trap was a party favor
at his 10th birthday!

37:56.691 --> 37:57.941
Oh, no.

37:58.526 --> 38:00.236
Father's playing with his trains.

38:01.905 --> 38:04.195
He wore that finger trap for two years!

38:04.365 --> 38:06.365
Mother had to teach him
to eat with his feet.

38:06.534 --> 38:09.164
And the combination and the password

38:09.329 --> 38:11.909
and my cigar and he slept so well!

38:15.627 --> 38:17.037
He's using the diesel.

38:28.640 --> 38:29.720
The covered bridge.

38:33.102 --> 38:34.312
Dead man's curve.

39:28.157 --> 39:30.827
It's all about Uncle Fester, isn't it?

39:40.878 --> 39:43.628
Spirits above me, give me a sign.

39:44.173 --> 39:46.883
Shall I be joyous or shall I be damned?

40:02.734 --> 40:04.404
Sleepless night?

40:07.322 --> 40:09.112
Walk with me, Fester.

40:15.204 --> 40:16.714
Aunt LaBorgia.

40:17.165 --> 40:19.365
Executed by a firing squad.

40:20.877 --> 40:22.377
Cousin Fledge.

40:22.879 --> 40:25.959
Torn limb from limb by four wild horses.

40:27.550 --> 40:29.840
Darling Uncle Eimar.

40:32.722 --> 40:34.182
Buried alive.

40:35.516 --> 40:38.556
Psychopaths, fiends,

40:38.728 --> 40:40.398
mad-dog killers.

40:41.064 --> 40:43.904
Brutes, Fester. Pioneers.

40:44.484 --> 40:46.074
Lest we forget.

40:47.362 --> 40:49.202
Your beloved Muerto.

40:50.990 --> 40:54.200
After you left,
he was simply a different vulture.

40:55.953 --> 40:57.703
He wouldn't circle.

40:58.706 --> 41:00.366
He wouldn't peck.

41:01.834 --> 41:04.544
That's how much
you mean to this family.

41:11.678 --> 41:13.718
Mother and Father Addams.

41:15.056 --> 41:18.426
How I wish the children
could have known them better.

41:19.227 --> 41:21.557
But tell that to an angry mob.

41:24.941 --> 41:29.741
And our credo,
"Sic gorgiamus allos subjectatos nunc."

41:30.530 --> 41:33.870
We gladly feast
on those who would subdue us.

41:34.784 --> 41:36.704
Not just pretty words.

41:40.248 --> 41:44.418
As an Addams,
you understand completely, don't you?

41:46.963 --> 41:50.053
As an Addams, yes, I do.

41:53.636 --> 41:55.386
Good night, Fester.

41:57.932 --> 41:59.472
Rest in peace.

42:08.818 --> 42:10.938
They're on to me, Mother.
I'm almost sure.

42:11.487 --> 42:13.317
Of course I tried.
I still can't find it.

42:13.489 --> 42:14.609
You've got to get over here.

42:14.657 --> 42:16.947
Arsenic, cyanide. Cyanide.
Arsenic, arsenic.

42:17.452 --> 42:18.992
Don't say that.

42:20.288 --> 42:21.788
You know I do.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.920
His trains are everywhere.
The children are beside themselves.

42:28.588 --> 42:30.588
Is that for your brother?

42:30.923 --> 42:32.553
I don't think so.

42:40.558 --> 42:42.178
This can't go on.

42:42.351 --> 42:44.851
How can I help him? Tell me, Mama.

42:46.397 --> 42:48.817
"Troubled husbands."

42:48.983 --> 42:50.693
- "Adultery"?
- Oh, no.

42:51.694 --> 42:54.574
- "Financial, money troubles"?
- No.

42:55.782 --> 42:59.242
- "Turned into toad or reptile."
- Is there an index?

43:01.245 --> 43:04.155
They know I'm a fraud, the whole bunch.

43:04.791 --> 43:06.171
It's not going to work.

43:06.334 --> 43:09.674
Who knows?
Gomez, that overheated moron?

43:10.129 --> 43:12.709
He's no moron. He's Fester's brother.

43:12.882 --> 43:14.422
They had some awful fight years ago.

43:14.592 --> 43:16.682
He's suspicious,
they all are, I can tell.

43:16.844 --> 43:19.054
Really? Well,
thank God I came over here.

43:19.222 --> 43:23.732
I will counsel the troubled family,
ease their distress.

43:23.893 --> 43:26.523
It's my calling. Remember, Gordon?

43:26.687 --> 43:29.687
- What?
- I'm a doctor.

43:32.485 --> 43:36.025
Why don't you speak to Fester, darling?
He's right outside the door.

43:36.197 --> 43:39.317
I would speak with Fester
if that were Fester.

43:39.534 --> 43:42.704
But that is not. That's an impostor!

43:42.870 --> 43:45.330
An impostore!

43:45.540 --> 43:48.210
A charlatan! A sham!

43:48.543 --> 43:50.043
A counterfeit.

43:57.552 --> 44:00.892
O, villain, villain,
smiling, damned villain!

44:01.055 --> 44:03.215
Who calls me a villain?
Breaks my pate across?

44:03.391 --> 44:04.701
- Bloodshed.
- Plucks off my beard,

44:04.725 --> 44:08.515
- and blows it in my face?
- If I must strike you dead, I will.

44:18.614 --> 44:19.664
No!

44:19.991 --> 44:23.241
No, no, no, no, no, no!

44:24.954 --> 44:26.714
Give me that sword.

44:27.623 --> 44:29.793
Haven't you ever slaughtered anyone?

44:29.959 --> 44:32.669
- He's only a child.
- No excuse.

44:33.462 --> 44:36.462
Aim for a major artery. The jugular.

44:36.632 --> 44:39.802
A faker! A phony!

44:39.969 --> 44:41.679
An utter fraud!

44:42.096 --> 44:46.136
- A base, deceitful...
- Mr. Addams!

44:47.435 --> 44:50.645
I believe I am understanding.
I can help, yes?

44:51.272 --> 44:54.612
The theory of displacement.

44:55.276 --> 44:56.936
Is this familiar?

44:57.528 --> 44:58.778
No. Tish?

44:58.946 --> 45:01.446
Oh, it is too exciting.

45:01.824 --> 45:03.494
I will explain.

45:03.784 --> 45:05.744
Is it unpleasant?

45:06.454 --> 45:07.664
Deeply.

45:09.790 --> 45:13.880
Your very own brother,
you drive him away.

45:14.045 --> 45:15.835
"Go. Off with you."

45:16.213 --> 45:20.053
But then you are feeling
the little black monster.

45:20.217 --> 45:22.717
- Pugsley.
- Guilt. Yes?

45:23.387 --> 45:26.467
Your brother returns, you feel guilty,

45:26.641 --> 45:29.231
- you displace.
- I do?

45:29.560 --> 45:33.270
The feelings in your brain cells,
they bubble and collide.

45:33.981 --> 45:36.481
You suspect things.

45:36.651 --> 45:39.361
You love him, but you resent him.

45:39.862 --> 45:41.992
Love, hate. Hate, love.

45:43.032 --> 45:44.702
Like for Mama. No?

45:45.201 --> 45:48.121
But I didn't hate my mother,
it was an accident.

45:48.287 --> 45:52.707
It's a very common psychosis,
I'm seeing it every day.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.500
Lucky doctor.

45:55.044 --> 45:58.384
Displacement. How bizarre.

45:58.547 --> 46:01.377
And here I thought
Fester was the problem.

46:02.051 --> 46:03.391
- He's sullen.
- He's furtive.

46:03.552 --> 46:04.682
- Backstabbing.
- He sulks.

46:04.845 --> 46:06.285
- I suspect him.
- You're unbalanced.

46:06.347 --> 46:09.887
And I hate him. By God, you're right!

46:10.393 --> 46:12.063
He is Fester!

46:12.436 --> 46:14.686
Thank you, Dr. Pinder-Schloss.

46:15.231 --> 46:16.861
I do what I can.

46:17.024 --> 46:19.784
You see, children,
there's lots to learn.

46:23.906 --> 46:25.276
"Gangrene."

46:27.243 --> 46:29.373
Uncle Fester,
how do you know so much?

46:29.537 --> 46:32.077
I've been around. I pick things up.

46:32.415 --> 46:34.365
In the Bermuda Triangle?

46:36.293 --> 46:38.553
Look, children, a new chapter.

46:39.046 --> 46:41.376
- "Scabs."
- "Scabs."

46:48.472 --> 46:51.732
Three parts dynamite
with a nitroglycerin cap.

46:51.934 --> 46:55.694
It's perfect for small holes,
carports and tool sheds.

47:02.528 --> 47:03.738
Mother.

47:04.572 --> 47:07.032
Everyone will be
at the children's play tonight, correct?

47:07.199 --> 47:09.199
Oh, yes. I've been working with them.

47:09.368 --> 47:11.868
- It's going to be fun.
- Fun?

47:13.706 --> 47:16.286
Is that what we're here for? Fun?

47:17.126 --> 47:19.746
Darling, forgive me.
You see what they've driven me to?

47:19.920 --> 47:23.300
I've raised a hand to my child,
my reason for living.

47:25.176 --> 47:28.886
- You can't go to the play.
- But the kids...

47:29.055 --> 47:31.555
The house will be deserted.
The vault will be ours.

47:31.724 --> 47:33.104
But, Mother...

47:34.560 --> 47:36.640
Can you hear it, my treasure?

47:36.812 --> 47:39.402
My heartbeat. It beats only for you.

47:39.565 --> 47:42.315
Listen closely.
It says, "Gordon, I love you",

47:42.485 --> 47:44.565
"Gordon, the vault."

47:45.696 --> 47:47.196
I do hear it.

47:47.531 --> 47:51.491
Soon we'll have the money
and we'll be far from here.

47:51.911 --> 47:55.001
Loving mother, grateful son.

47:55.664 --> 47:56.794
Understood?

48:02.922 --> 48:05.012
There you are, at last.

48:06.217 --> 48:08.927
What a fool I was to doubt you.

48:09.095 --> 48:11.845
Dr. Pinder-Schloss
explained everything.

48:12.014 --> 48:14.354
What a lovely woman. So chilly.

48:14.767 --> 48:17.887
Displacement. It's a common psychosis.

48:18.062 --> 48:20.152
- Isn't that grand?
- Is it?

48:21.190 --> 48:22.900
Look at it, Fester.

48:23.067 --> 48:27.397
The primeval ooze.
Quicksand, fumes, toxic waste.

48:27.571 --> 48:31.701
It's all ours, Fester.
You belong here, old man.

48:32.034 --> 48:34.834
- Stay.
- You don't know what you're asking.

48:35.579 --> 48:39.039
You have a beautiful wife,
wonderful children,

48:39.875 --> 48:41.325
a wasteland.

48:42.419 --> 48:43.999
I'm in the way.

48:44.713 --> 48:45.883
In the way?

48:46.715 --> 48:49.375
- My brother?
- Gomez, take care!

48:51.220 --> 48:54.060
For you, life is all fun and games.

48:54.890 --> 48:57.980
A dance in a graveyard. Stench. Decay.

48:58.519 --> 49:02.019
- But things change.
- Precisely. You're back.

49:03.065 --> 49:05.895
All those years apart, Fester.

49:06.527 --> 49:08.397
We can't do that again.

49:11.198 --> 49:12.778
You're home.

49:36.599 --> 49:37.769
Fore!

49:42.229 --> 49:44.109
Damn you, Addams!

49:50.404 --> 49:51.704
Uncle Fester?

49:51.864 --> 49:54.624
Come on, Uncle Fester.
Come to the play.

49:55.367 --> 49:57.287
I said I was busy.

49:57.620 --> 50:01.960
But you said you'd help us,
with the Shakespeare and the pus.

50:02.124 --> 50:03.794
I changed my mind.

50:18.599 --> 50:21.269
Mrs. Addams,
can I see you for a moment?

50:22.436 --> 50:24.896
I'm Susan Firkins.
I'm Wednesday's teacher.

50:25.064 --> 50:26.564
Oh, of course, Miss Firkins.

50:26.732 --> 50:29.322
Wednesday's told us
so much about you.

50:37.952 --> 50:42.662
Wednesday is an excellent student,
but, frankly, I'm concerned.

50:42.831 --> 50:45.211
You see,
this is our class bulletin board.

50:45.376 --> 50:49.916
This month, our theme is our heroes,
people we love and admire.

50:50.381 --> 50:53.301
You see, Susan Ringo
has chosen the President.

50:53.467 --> 50:54.967
Isn't that sweet?

50:55.469 --> 50:58.639
And Harmony Feld
has picked Jane Pauley.

51:00.599 --> 51:02.889
Have you spoken to her parents?

51:03.644 --> 51:07.024
But Wednesday brought in this picture,

51:07.189 --> 51:09.109
Calpurnia Addams.

51:09.566 --> 51:12.436
Wednesday's great-aunt Calpurnia.

51:12.611 --> 51:15.361
She was burned as a witch in 1706.

51:15.698 --> 51:18.618
They say she danced naked
in the town square

51:18.784 --> 51:20.794
and enslaved a minister.

51:21.537 --> 51:23.707
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

51:24.373 --> 51:28.793
But don't worry.
We've told Wednesday, college first.

51:30.004 --> 51:33.054
Isn't he adorable?

51:33.674 --> 51:36.844
- I made this myself.
- It's charming.

51:37.011 --> 51:38.761
What is he, a lizard?

51:39.263 --> 51:40.513
An elf.

51:41.640 --> 51:43.310
Look at you.

51:49.815 --> 51:51.645
That's better.

51:52.026 --> 51:54.686
You are too precious for words.

51:54.862 --> 51:57.452
Why, I could just eat you alive.

51:57.865 --> 52:00.025
Oh, no, Margaret. Too young.

52:31.607 --> 52:34.857
Wednesday. Pugsley.
I changed my mind.

52:35.736 --> 52:37.236
Uncle Fester.

52:43.869 --> 52:45.869
Gordon? Gordon?

52:46.955 --> 52:48.365
It's Mother.

52:51.543 --> 52:53.383
Damn it, where is he?

52:54.254 --> 52:56.594
I never should have used him.

53:07.017 --> 53:09.727
I knew you couldn't stay away, old man.

53:29.331 --> 53:30.581
Damn it.

53:31.917 --> 53:34.287
Gordon! Gordon!

53:34.461 --> 53:35.961
Are you there?

53:37.548 --> 53:38.838
Gordon.

53:43.345 --> 53:45.845
My goodness! Say! Look!
Would somebody come here!

53:46.014 --> 53:47.814
Oh, my! Oh, good...

53:48.559 --> 53:49.979
Oh, my!

53:51.353 --> 53:53.233
How all occasions
do inform against me,

53:53.397 --> 53:55.107
And spur my dull revenge!

53:55.274 --> 53:56.484
O, from this time forth,

53:56.650 --> 53:58.570
My thoughts be bloody,
or nothing worth!

53:58.735 --> 54:01.235
If I must strike you dead, I will.

54:04.491 --> 54:05.661
A hit,

54:06.243 --> 54:08.703
a very palpable hit.

54:19.381 --> 54:21.171
O proud death,

54:21.341 --> 54:24.221
What feast is toward
in thine eternal cell?

54:26.513 --> 54:29.853
Sweet oblivion, open your arms!

54:47.409 --> 54:48.739
Bravo!

54:50.412 --> 54:52.872
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

54:53.415 --> 55:00.705
Bravo!

55:00.923 --> 55:03.843
There were sailors, pirates

55:04.676 --> 55:08.346
and a plane full of tourists
from Miami Beach,

55:09.056 --> 55:11.136
all lost in the Triangle.

55:11.683 --> 55:14.693
Uncle Fester,
will you take me there someday?

55:14.937 --> 55:16.477
It's a promise.

55:17.397 --> 55:19.017
- Good night, Wednesday.
- Good night.

55:19.191 --> 55:20.861
You were terrific.

55:23.153 --> 55:24.613
Uncle Fester?

55:46.468 --> 55:48.258
A theatrical triumph.

55:49.054 --> 55:50.724
It's like a dream.

55:51.139 --> 55:54.479
When we first met,
it was an evening much like this.

55:55.102 --> 55:56.732
Magic in the air.

55:57.813 --> 55:58.983
A boy.

55:59.773 --> 56:00.983
A girl.

56:01.733 --> 56:03.233
An open grave.

56:03.986 --> 56:05.946
It was my first funeral.

56:06.738 --> 56:08.818
You were so beautiful.

56:09.616 --> 56:11.446
Pale and mysterious.

56:12.494 --> 56:14.874
No one even looked at the corpse.

56:15.372 --> 56:17.332
Your cousin, Balthazar.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
You were still a suspect.

56:21.378 --> 56:25.008
I couldn't stop staring at you
all through the eulogy.

56:26.341 --> 56:29.801
Your eyes, your moustache,

56:31.179 --> 56:32.509
your laugh.

56:34.349 --> 56:36.019
You bewitched me.

56:37.436 --> 56:39.516
I proposed that very night.

56:40.522 --> 56:44.192
Just think,
someday we'll be buried here

56:44.818 --> 56:47.608
side by side, six feet under

56:47.988 --> 56:49.858
in matching coffins.

56:50.866 --> 56:53.026
Our lifeless bodies

56:53.201 --> 56:57.291
rotting together for all eternity.

56:59.666 --> 57:01.206
Cara Mia.

57:02.711 --> 57:04.341
Mon Sauvage.

57:35.202 --> 57:36.912
Hey, Bigfoot.

57:41.375 --> 57:43.575
Don't stare. Just get me out.

57:50.342 --> 57:51.342
Did you like the blood?

57:52.886 --> 57:55.506
- I was so proud.
- Weren't we all?

57:56.348 --> 57:58.598
Wednesday, play with your food.

58:06.566 --> 58:07.726
Mama.

58:07.901 --> 58:09.691
Who put this in here?

58:12.698 --> 58:15.238
- That's for company.
- Rascals.

58:16.159 --> 58:19.039
Doctor, you were so right.

58:19.204 --> 58:21.964
- What an evening.
- Fester fit right in.

58:22.124 --> 58:25.424
- The displacement is over.
- Well, isn't that nice.

58:25.627 --> 58:29.167
- Does he really have to go?
- Yes, he does.

58:29.339 --> 58:32.509
Well, if he insists upon leaving,

58:32.968 --> 58:35.178
we shall mark the occasion.

58:35.971 --> 58:37.141
Tish?

58:37.305 --> 58:41.885
- We've planned a farewell party.
- We've invited the entire clan.

58:42.352 --> 58:44.402
What a lovely gesture.

58:44.646 --> 58:46.356
We're a family again

58:46.523 --> 58:48.903
and we owe it all to you,
Dr. Pinder-Schloss.

58:49.067 --> 58:51.357
Please. Greta.

58:51.820 --> 58:52.900
Greta.

58:54.156 --> 58:56.316
Fester, walk me out.

59:00.912 --> 59:04.672
I'm fine, Mother.
I'm completely in control.

59:04.833 --> 59:07.173
They're not your family, Gordon. I am.

59:07.335 --> 59:09.085
They don't love you. I do.

59:09.254 --> 59:12.674
They're evil and corrupt and degraded.

59:12.841 --> 59:16.051
- I can give you that.
- I'm fine. Really.

59:16.428 --> 59:18.258
We'll see. Open up!

59:47.375 --> 59:48.665
A party?

59:49.503 --> 59:50.673
For me?

59:52.088 --> 59:53.168
Here?

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:04.850
Tish, how long has it been
since we've waltzed?

01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:07.189
Oh, Gomez.

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:13.070
Hours.

01:01:20.468 --> 01:01:21.888
It, old man!

01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:26.681
You're right. Far too long.

01:01:33.106 --> 01:01:35.936
- Don't let me out of your sight.
- Don't threaten me, Margaret.

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:39.109
- These people are abnormal.
- Don't exaggerate.

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:48.450
Oh, by all means!
They're clients, Margaret.

01:01:56.004 --> 01:01:58.424
- Wednesday?
- Yes, Mother?

01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:02.090
Would you run upstairs
and check on your uncle, please?

01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:06.311
Why, Lumpy Addams. Look at you.

01:02:07.182 --> 01:02:08.642
All grown up.

01:02:21.071 --> 01:02:22.531
Uncle Fester?

01:02:25.533 --> 01:02:27.533
- I understand.
- I hope so.

01:02:27.702 --> 01:02:28.992
And I'm counting on you.

01:02:29.162 --> 01:02:31.792
Don't let me down. Don't buckle.

01:02:31.957 --> 01:02:34.787
It's not gonna be easy.
There are people everywhere.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:37.670
You can do it if you just stop whining.

01:02:38.338 --> 01:02:40.838
Nobody likes that. It's unattractive.

01:02:41.007 --> 01:02:45.507
All right. Fine.
I will try and reach the vault tonight.

01:02:45.971 --> 01:02:49.391
But if I can't, well, then that's it.

01:02:50.517 --> 01:02:51.977
Okay, Mother?

01:02:52.310 --> 01:02:55.020
I knew it. You are a fake.

01:02:55.313 --> 01:02:57.563
Come here, my little one.

01:02:57.732 --> 01:02:59.532
- Wednesday!
- Get her!

01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:48.235
Flora and Fauna Amor.

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:51.162
I cannot see.

01:03:51.536 --> 01:03:54.286
I am blinded by such beauty.

01:03:54.456 --> 01:03:55.536
Gomez Addams.

01:03:55.707 --> 01:03:57.417
- You terrible flirt.
- Always was.

01:03:57.584 --> 01:03:58.754
- At least with me.
- Copycat!

01:03:58.918 --> 01:04:02.298
- Tag-along!
- Why, Gomez, the Amor twins.

01:04:02.547 --> 01:04:04.967
- I've heard so much about you.
- Morticia...

01:04:05.133 --> 01:04:06.843
- You nabbed him.
- This darling man.

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:08.680
- He was mine!
- He was mine!

01:04:08.845 --> 01:04:11.215
Flora, Fauna, how can I compete?

01:04:11.598 --> 01:04:13.808
You're twice the woman I am.

01:04:14.142 --> 01:04:16.692
Tully, the Amor twins.

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:19.690
They're waiting for Fester. Amuse them.

01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:24.690
- Hello, Tully.
- Oh, my God.

01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:33.950
You mean you don't know?
It's too intriguing.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:37.500
Now that Fester's back,
he's king of the castle again, isn't he?

01:04:37.665 --> 01:04:40.075
Fester's the older brother,
so he gets it all.

01:04:40.251 --> 01:04:42.291
The house, the money, you name it.

01:04:42.462 --> 01:04:44.342
Fester's still single, isn't he?

01:04:44.506 --> 01:04:47.166
- Are you, Mr. Alford?
- Why, Fauna.

01:04:47.342 --> 01:04:49.932
- I'm Fauna.
- I'm Flora.

01:04:51.304 --> 01:04:54.524
I'm flattered. Excuse me, ladies.

01:04:59.687 --> 01:05:02.937
I can't find her anywhere.
Let's just leave.

01:05:03.358 --> 01:05:05.528
- Out the back.
- Now pull yourself together.

01:05:05.693 --> 01:05:07.443
She'll turn up, the little cockroach.

01:05:07.612 --> 01:05:09.572
You get to the party
or they'll suspect something.

01:05:09.656 --> 01:05:11.946
- I'll be down soon.
- Yes, Mother.

01:05:19.207 --> 01:05:22.327
Everyone, your attention, please.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:30.430
Tonight we dance
for our treasured guest of honor,

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:32.093
Fester Addams.

01:05:34.681 --> 01:05:37.681
The mamushka!

01:05:39.352 --> 01:05:42.352
Taught to us by our Cossack cousins,

01:05:42.522 --> 01:05:45.442
the mamushka has been
an Addams' family tradition

01:05:45.608 --> 01:05:47.228
since God knows when.

01:05:47.402 --> 01:05:50.242
We danced the mamushka
while Nero fiddled.

01:05:50.405 --> 01:05:53.155
We danced the mamushka at Waterloo.

01:05:53.575 --> 01:05:57.535
We danced the mamushka
for Jack the Ripper.

01:05:58.204 --> 01:06:01.044
And now, Fester Addams,

01:06:01.583 --> 01:06:05.713
this mamushka is for you.

01:06:27.609 --> 01:06:32.109
- Where are you going? There's trouble.
- Hey! Not to worry. Plan B.

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:34.780
- But that hideous little girl knows...
- I'm in charge.

01:06:34.949 --> 01:06:36.989
Ten minutes, I'll be back.

01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:35.215
Mamushka, mamushka

01:07:35.385 --> 01:07:36.835
He comes for his mamushka

01:07:37.011 --> 01:07:38.530
With a hey and a hey
and a hey and a hey

01:07:38.554 --> 01:07:41.644
And a hey and a hey
and a hey and a hey

01:07:41.808 --> 01:07:43.688
And a hey and a hey
and a hey and a hey and a...

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.230
Wait!

01:07:48.356 --> 01:07:52.356
I swear by Mummy

01:07:52.527 --> 01:07:54.647
And Daddums

01:07:55.154 --> 01:07:57.994
This detestable Fester's

01:07:58.157 --> 01:08:01.657
The Echt Fester Addams

01:08:03.329 --> 01:08:07.039
So hey, hey, hey, hey
hey, hey, hey, hey

01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:10.998
Let's dance the dance of brotherly love!

01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:12.550
Mamushka!

01:08:16.216 --> 01:08:18.676
What the hell's going on over there?

01:08:18.845 --> 01:08:22.255
How would you like to be rid
of the Addamses for good?

01:08:23.224 --> 01:08:26.564
- I'm serious.
- What can I do for you?

01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:31.439
You are gonna love this.

01:08:34.359 --> 01:08:37.490
We've been married
for almost 20 years.

01:08:39.073 --> 01:08:41.283
Sometimes it seems like more.

01:08:44.245 --> 01:08:47.904
Well, people grow. People change.

01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:00.890
Isn't it a beautiful night?

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:08.305
You'll come see me before you leave,
won't you, Fester?

01:09:08.478 --> 01:09:10.268
I'll call once I'm alone.

01:09:10.438 --> 01:09:12.518
There's your ride, girls.

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:28.413
You're a marvelous dancer.
It's been such fun.

01:09:31.584 --> 01:09:34.294
I can't. We mustn't.

01:09:40.926 --> 01:09:41.966
Call me!

01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:44.136
Mamushka, mamushka

01:09:44.305 --> 01:09:46.635
I swallowed with one whoosh-ka!

01:09:46.808 --> 01:09:48.178
And a hey and a hey

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:50.520
And a hey and a hey and a hey

01:09:51.145 --> 01:09:52.595
Hey, hey!

01:09:53.648 --> 01:09:56.818
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:09:56.984 --> 01:09:57.984
Gordon.

01:09:58.152 --> 01:09:59.152
Hey. Hey, hey

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:00.320
Gordon, Gordon, stop it.

01:10:00.488 --> 01:10:01.488
Gordon, no.

01:10:01.656 --> 01:10:02.656
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:10:02.824 --> 01:10:03.824
Stop it, Gordon. Stop it!

01:10:03.991 --> 01:10:05.661
Stop it, this instant.

01:10:06.452 --> 01:10:09.662
- Is that lipstick all over your face?
- From the twins.

01:10:09.831 --> 01:10:12.581
The beauteous Amor twins.

01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:14.080
The twins?

01:10:14.252 --> 01:10:17.002
Gordon, I don't understand this.
Let me get this clear.

01:10:17.171 --> 01:10:21.131
- Have you been having a good time?
- Yes! I have!

01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:22.930
It was marvelous.

01:10:23.094 --> 01:10:26.934
I sang up a storm
and danced till I dropped!

01:10:27.181 --> 01:10:30.681
The mamushka! The mamushka!

01:10:30.852 --> 01:10:35.482
And a hey and a hey
and a hey and a hey and a hey

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:40.567
- Mother?
- Mother? Mother? Who is that?

01:10:40.736 --> 01:10:43.776
- I don't think I recall.
- Mother, please.

01:10:43.948 --> 01:10:46.408
I'm just fine. I'm dandy.

01:10:46.826 --> 01:10:49.326
Don't concern yourself
about me, Gordon.

01:10:49.495 --> 01:10:52.615
Please, return to your depraved orgy.

01:10:53.249 --> 01:10:56.079
Sometimes I think
you're not even my son.

01:10:56.252 --> 01:10:59.252
- Don't say that.
- I'm just your mother.

01:10:59.422 --> 01:11:02.972
You only owe me
your entire existence on this planet.

01:11:03.426 --> 01:11:06.796
Please, Gordon, by all means,
go sing, dance, date.

01:11:06.971 --> 01:11:10.311
Oh, Mother, I'm so terribly sorry.

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:16.653
It was just a party. It's over.

01:11:17.565 --> 01:11:19.185
It means nothing.

01:11:19.692 --> 01:11:23.032
The Siamese twins, the hunchback,
Cousin It,

01:11:23.654 --> 01:11:25.164
they're not you.

01:11:25.323 --> 01:11:27.823
Say it, Gordon. Make me believe it.

01:11:28.326 --> 01:11:31.656
I love you. And I want money.

01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:34.250
We've got to find Tully.

01:11:39.170 --> 01:11:41.710
Look, our little boy.

01:11:42.173 --> 01:11:43.673
All tuckered out.

01:11:43.841 --> 01:11:47.841
It's so sweet.
He looks just like a little entrée.

01:11:49.388 --> 01:11:52.518
- Where's the party?
- It's over, darling.

01:11:53.226 --> 01:11:57.016
- Have you seen your sister?
- Not since before the mamushka.

01:11:57.813 --> 01:11:58.983
Gomez.

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:02.399
Fan out.
Pugsley, head for the dung heap.

01:12:02.568 --> 01:12:05.148
Mama and Morticia, the shallow graves.
I'll take the abyss.

01:12:05.321 --> 01:12:07.661
Lurch, check out the bottomless pit.

01:12:07.823 --> 01:12:09.413
- Fester?
- Up here!

01:12:09.992 --> 01:12:14.622
Fester, you take the ravine
and the unmarked abandoned well.

01:12:14.789 --> 01:12:18.749
Someone should stay behind
in case she comes back.

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:21.085
Good man. Good thinking!

01:12:21.254 --> 01:12:23.384
Then who'll take the swamp?

01:12:26.717 --> 01:12:30.047
That's the spirit, Thing. Lend a hand.
Let's go!

01:12:37.395 --> 01:12:38.555
Gordon!

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:41.020
Don't dawdle.

01:12:52.577 --> 01:12:55.367
- What are you doing?
- I'm relaxing.

01:12:56.497 --> 01:12:59.787
- Taking a little sun.
- Have you gone mad?

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:17.385
Wednesday!

01:14:00.186 --> 01:14:03.356
- What is all this?
- This is a restraining order.

01:14:03.522 --> 01:14:05.192
- A restraining order?
- Yes.

01:14:05.358 --> 01:14:09.318
It requires you
to keep a distance of 1,000 yards

01:14:09.487 --> 01:14:10.487
from this house.

01:14:10.655 --> 01:14:12.855
I am restrained from my own house?

01:14:13.032 --> 01:14:15.662
Not your house, mustache.
Not anymore.

01:14:15.826 --> 01:14:18.326
It belongs to
the oldest living descendant,

01:14:18.496 --> 01:14:21.706
the elder brother, Fester Addams.

01:14:21.874 --> 01:14:25.004
- Fester adores Gomez.
- No, no, he's afraid of him.

01:14:25.169 --> 01:14:28.629
Seeing the twins brought it all back.
You're bitter rivals, Gomez.

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:32.048
- I demand to speak with Fester.
- Sorry. No can do.

01:14:32.677 --> 01:14:35.137
He's very hurt. Just leave.

01:14:37.723 --> 01:14:40.023
But he isn't even Uncle Fester.

01:14:43.646 --> 01:14:46.686
Have no fear. Justice shall prevail.

01:14:47.233 --> 01:14:49.153
The courts will decide.

01:14:49.652 --> 01:14:53.492
They say a man who represents himself
has a fool for a client.

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:55.986
Well, with God as my witness,

01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:58.198
I am that fool!

01:14:58.994 --> 01:15:03.164
Therefore, it is with no small amount
of personal satisfaction

01:15:03.749 --> 01:15:08.249
that I declare Fester Addams
legal executor of the Addams estate

01:15:08.504 --> 01:15:11.634
and rightful owner of all possessions

01:15:11.799 --> 01:15:15.839
and properties contained therein,
with one exception.

01:15:16.011 --> 01:15:17.801
Gomez Addams,

01:15:18.347 --> 01:15:22.227
I believe these are yours.

01:17:01.242 --> 01:17:04.582
- You are doing this on purpose.
- That's right, Mother. Isn't this fun?

01:17:04.745 --> 01:17:06.495
I'll race you back.

01:17:08.499 --> 01:17:11.079
Yes, we've been forced from our home.

01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:14.840
Yes, we've been betrayed
by those we trusted,

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:18.717
but we are Addamses,
and we will not submit.

01:17:20.386 --> 01:17:23.636
Who recalls the fable
of The Tortoise and the Hare?

01:17:24.014 --> 01:17:27.234
The swift yet lazy little cottontail

01:17:27.393 --> 01:17:30.023
and his slow
but determined companion?

01:17:30.688 --> 01:17:32.308
What does this story teach us?

01:17:32.481 --> 01:17:35.281
Kill the hare! Skin it. Boil it.

01:17:35.442 --> 01:17:38.192
- Put the tortoise on the highway.
- During rush hour.

01:17:38.362 --> 01:17:41.282
Yes. We will survive.

01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:45.661
Poison us. Strangle us.
Break our bones.

01:17:45.828 --> 01:17:47.908
We will come back for more.

01:17:48.706 --> 01:17:50.076
And why?

01:17:50.249 --> 01:17:53.669
- Because we like it.
- Because we're Addamses.

01:17:53.836 --> 01:17:55.376
We're Addamses.

01:18:03.262 --> 01:18:05.312
Here, Lurch. On the house.

01:18:23.032 --> 01:18:26.492
We have so many homemakers
re-entering the workforce.

01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:29.500
Your domestic skills
can be very valuable.

01:18:29.663 --> 01:18:32.333
- College?
- Private tutors.

01:18:33.334 --> 01:18:35.504
- Major?
- Spells and hexes.

01:18:36.670 --> 01:18:38.170
Liberal Arts.

01:18:38.964 --> 01:18:42.344
What about your husband?
Is he currently employed?

01:18:43.594 --> 01:18:46.304
He's going through a bad patch
at the moment,

01:18:46.472 --> 01:18:47.972
but it's not his fault.

01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:49.640
Of course not.

01:18:50.809 --> 01:18:53.349
What is he, a loafer?
A hopeless layabout?

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:55.310
A shiftless dreamer?

01:18:57.483 --> 01:18:58.943
Not anymore.

01:19:04.823 --> 01:19:07.663
- Is this made from real lemons?
- Yes.

01:19:07.993 --> 01:19:10.663
I only like all-natural
fruits and beverages

01:19:10.829 --> 01:19:13.619
organically grown with no preservatives.

01:19:13.958 --> 01:19:16.998
- Are you sure they're real lemons?
- Yes.

01:19:17.461 --> 01:19:19.501
Well, I'll tell you what.

01:19:19.672 --> 01:19:20.802
I'll buy a cup

01:19:20.965 --> 01:19:23.965
if you buy a box
of my delicious Girl Scout cookies.

01:19:24.134 --> 01:19:25.554
Do we have a deal?

01:19:25.719 --> 01:19:28.259
Are they made from real Girl Scouts?

01:19:40.526 --> 01:19:42.936
And so,
the witch lured Hansel and Gretel

01:19:43.112 --> 01:19:46.742
into the candy house
by promising them more sweets.

01:19:46.991 --> 01:19:49.281
And she told them to look in the oven.

01:19:49.451 --> 01:19:53.161
And she was about to push them in
when, lo and behold,

01:19:53.539 --> 01:19:56.619
Hansel pushed the poor,
defenseless witch

01:19:56.792 --> 01:20:00.502
into the oven instead,
where she was burned alive,

01:20:00.671 --> 01:20:02.341
writhing in agony.

01:20:05.551 --> 01:20:09.851
Now, boys and girls,
what do you think that feels like?

01:21:03.776 --> 01:21:05.436
Welcome to the show.

01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:07.422
Voodoo witch doctors
here in the United States.

01:21:07.446 --> 01:21:08.446
Here, kitty, kitty.

01:21:08.614 --> 01:21:12.994
Do they really exist
or is this just tabloid hooey?

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:15.240
We'd love you to call in
with your comments.

01:21:17.998 --> 01:21:20.248
After lunch, we'll try again.

01:21:21.752 --> 01:21:23.172
Yes, Mother.

01:21:26.965 --> 01:21:28.965
We'll find the money.

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:32.930
Meanwhile, we have this little nest,
quiet and cozy

01:21:33.097 --> 01:21:35.557
without that dreadful family.

01:21:36.975 --> 01:21:38.385
Yes, Mother.

01:21:39.061 --> 01:21:41.901
So, you claim that your son
was brainwashed

01:21:42.064 --> 01:21:45.904
by voodoo witch doctors
and forced to recruit others.

01:21:46.485 --> 01:21:47.565
Let's take a call.

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:49.146
Hello, Sally.

01:21:49.321 --> 01:21:51.911
Mr. Addams, please stop calling.

01:21:52.407 --> 01:21:54.237
We do not know where they meet.

01:21:54.409 --> 01:21:56.409
Let's take another call.

01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:00.830
Gomez, why don't we go for a drive?

01:22:01.333 --> 01:22:03.423
- The whole family.
- A drive?

01:22:04.419 --> 01:22:07.459
- And miss Gilligan?
- Dinner's gonna be late.

01:22:08.257 --> 01:22:10.257
Here, boy. Here, boy.

01:22:18.517 --> 01:22:19.727
Gordon.

01:22:20.894 --> 01:22:22.154
Gordon!

01:23:29.463 --> 01:23:32.263
I would like to
speak with Fester, please.

01:23:41.099 --> 01:23:45.139
You're a desperate woman
consumed by greed and bitterness.

01:23:45.812 --> 01:23:48.982
- We could have been such friends.
- Gordon, let's get started.

01:23:49.149 --> 01:23:50.649
- But, Mother...
- Stop stalling.

01:23:50.817 --> 01:23:53.607
I'm not stalling. Stop badgering me.

01:23:55.989 --> 01:23:59.829
- The vault, Mrs. Addams, any thoughts?
- None whatsoever.

01:23:59.993 --> 01:24:02.123
Tully, take over. Tighten it.

01:24:02.287 --> 01:24:04.140
But I got this stomach thing
when I torture people.

01:24:04.164 --> 01:24:05.334
Do it.

01:24:08.794 --> 01:24:09.964
Again.

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:20.050
Tighter.

01:24:24.226 --> 01:24:26.226
You've done this before.

01:25:13.608 --> 01:25:16.738
Who is it?
We're paid through Thursday.

01:25:17.863 --> 01:25:19.573
Morticia.

01:25:20.032 --> 01:25:23.242
Morticia. Morticia what?

01:25:23.994 --> 01:25:27.044
Slow down!
It's terrible when you stutter.

01:25:40.385 --> 01:25:44.635
Morticia in danger.

01:25:45.223 --> 01:25:46.393
Stop.

01:25:46.558 --> 01:25:50.638
Send help at once. Stop!

01:25:53.315 --> 01:25:55.975
You can't! Not with red-hot pokers!

01:25:56.902 --> 01:25:59.532
- Is this gonna smell?
- Tully Alford,

01:25:59.696 --> 01:26:03.066
charlatan, deadbeat, parasite.

01:26:04.159 --> 01:26:06.159
How Gomez adored you.

01:26:06.328 --> 01:26:08.658
Well, not enough.

01:26:09.623 --> 01:26:12.753
Morticia, please.

01:26:12.918 --> 01:26:16.628
And dear Fester, which is the real you?

01:26:17.422 --> 01:26:20.512
The loathsome,
underhanded monster you've become

01:26:20.967 --> 01:26:24.427
or the loathsome, underhanded monster
we came to love?

01:26:24.638 --> 01:26:25.848
Don't ask me.

01:26:43.532 --> 01:26:45.872
I know what you're feeling, Fester.

01:26:46.034 --> 01:26:47.284
Gordon!

01:26:48.537 --> 01:26:51.957
Gordon, I have a thought.
Just a notion, top of my head.

01:26:52.124 --> 01:26:53.964
Tell me what you think?

01:26:54.126 --> 01:26:57.626
Since you and Mrs. Addams
are so very close,

01:26:59.339 --> 01:27:00.969
be my guest.

01:27:03.677 --> 01:27:04.967
Addams!

01:27:07.305 --> 01:27:09.175
Darling, take care.

01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:12.940
Dirty pool, old man. Never again!

01:27:24.114 --> 01:27:25.784
One for you, Tully.

01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:28.030
And now...

01:27:38.086 --> 01:27:39.416
One for me.

01:27:39.588 --> 01:27:42.338
- Gomez, I'm on retainer.
- Let him up.

01:27:52.392 --> 01:27:55.232
That's right. Now get moving, Addams.

01:27:58.732 --> 01:28:00.612
Take him to the vault,

01:28:01.443 --> 01:28:03.993
and if you're not back in one hour,

01:28:04.779 --> 01:28:06.659
I displace her.

01:28:11.244 --> 01:28:14.124
Tish, seeing you like this,

01:28:14.289 --> 01:28:15.789
my blood boils.

01:28:15.957 --> 01:28:17.457
As does mine.

01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:21.460
- This wheel of pain.
- Our wheel.

01:28:21.630 --> 01:28:24.800
To live without you,
only that would be torture.

01:28:25.383 --> 01:28:28.893
A day alone, only that would be death.

01:28:31.223 --> 01:28:32.643
Knock it off.

01:28:34.476 --> 01:28:36.636
The vault, Addams, right now.

01:28:46.613 --> 01:28:49.413
- But, Mother, can't we...
- Can it, Gordon.

01:28:49.574 --> 01:28:52.914
Stop dragging your feet.
You disgust me!

01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:56.040
You're nothing
but a useless, sniveling baby.

01:28:56.206 --> 01:28:58.116
A stone around my neck.

01:28:58.458 --> 01:29:00.378
What was I thinking?

01:29:00.544 --> 01:29:02.294
I should have left you
where I found you.

01:29:03.588 --> 01:29:06.088
No tricks, Gomez!

01:29:07.050 --> 01:29:09.050
That's the wrong book.

01:29:18.311 --> 01:29:19.731
Allow me.

01:29:22.524 --> 01:29:24.234
Good show, old man.

01:29:26.987 --> 01:29:30.657
Put that book down, Gordon.
You don't know what it can do.

01:29:31.491 --> 01:29:34.871
- It's not just literature.
- Oh, really?

01:29:36.871 --> 01:29:37.961
Quickly, darling.

01:29:38.123 --> 01:29:40.123
Gordon, I'm your friend.

01:29:40.542 --> 01:29:44.462
- Think of the doubloons.
- They're not yours, Tully.

01:29:45.130 --> 01:29:46.130
Back off!

01:29:46.298 --> 01:29:49.218
Leather straps. Red-hot pokers.

01:29:49.843 --> 01:29:51.223
Later, my dearest.

01:29:51.386 --> 01:29:54.216
Keep the book closed, Gordon.
Listen to Mother.

01:29:54.389 --> 01:29:58.179
I'll never listen to you,
never ever again.

01:29:58.351 --> 01:30:01.651
I had to be strict with you
because I cared. Put it down!

01:30:01.813 --> 01:30:04.153
You never really loved me.

01:30:04.566 --> 01:30:05.646
Fester, this way!

01:30:05.817 --> 01:30:07.457
Stop whining,
you little good-for-nothing.

01:30:07.485 --> 01:30:08.895
Be a man!

01:30:09.404 --> 01:30:12.494
You were a terrible mother!

01:30:13.074 --> 01:30:15.334
There! I said it.

01:31:06.628 --> 01:31:08.128
Are they dead?

01:31:08.505 --> 01:31:10.125
Does it matter?

01:31:28.108 --> 01:31:29.818
Trick or...

01:31:34.656 --> 01:31:36.116
Here we come!

01:31:36.825 --> 01:31:39.365
- Pugsley, old man.
- Why, look at you.

01:31:43.915 --> 01:31:45.325
How do you like it?

01:31:47.127 --> 01:31:50.167
What can I say?
He's gonna break hearts.

01:31:50.338 --> 01:31:51.918
Trick or treat.

01:31:54.259 --> 01:31:56.509
Hello, Margaret. Cousin It.

01:31:56.678 --> 01:31:59.968
- I almost didn't recognize you.
- Isn't he handsome?

01:32:00.432 --> 01:32:03.562
Everyone keeps asking
where he bought his costume.

01:32:03.727 --> 01:32:05.307
It is a wonderful hat.

01:32:06.521 --> 01:32:09.481
What are you, darling?
Where's your costume?

01:32:09.649 --> 01:32:12.149
This is my costume.
I'm a homicidal maniac.

01:32:12.318 --> 01:32:14.698
They look just like everyone else.

01:32:19.242 --> 01:32:22.622
I'm so glad
I can spend this night with my family,

01:32:22.787 --> 01:32:24.657
now that I've got my memory back.

01:32:24.831 --> 01:32:29.001
Thank God for that lightning.
Knocked some sense into you.

01:32:32.130 --> 01:32:33.670
You remember, old man.

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:36.090
Dr. Pinder-Schloss
really did find Fester

01:32:36.259 --> 01:32:38.929
tangled in a tuna net 25 years ago,

01:32:39.471 --> 01:32:40.931
with amnesia.

01:32:41.097 --> 01:32:43.137
From the Bermuda Triangle.

01:32:46.519 --> 01:32:49.349
How true.
Stranger things have happened.

01:32:49.522 --> 01:32:51.322
Please, Uncle Fester.

01:32:52.150 --> 01:32:54.490
- Pugsley.
- For the picture.

01:33:01.618 --> 01:33:04.948
All right, everybody, time for a game.

01:33:05.288 --> 01:33:08.118
What shall it be? Bobbing for apples?

01:33:08.291 --> 01:33:09.421
Charades?

01:33:10.752 --> 01:33:13.212
Of course. Wake the dead.

01:33:13.379 --> 01:33:16.759
- Wake the dead!
- Wake the dead!

01:33:17.342 --> 01:33:19.222
Out to the cemetery!
Come on, everyone.

01:33:19.385 --> 01:33:21.255
I've never played this before.

01:33:21.429 --> 01:33:23.509
- How does it go?
- Did you bring a shovel?

01:33:23.681 --> 01:33:26.601
- Uncle Fester, will you be on my team?
- No, mine.

01:33:26.768 --> 01:33:28.528
I tell you what.
We'll give you a head start.

01:33:28.603 --> 01:33:31.233
Three skulls and a pelvis. How is that?

01:33:34.317 --> 01:33:37.067
My own dear brother.

01:33:46.579 --> 01:33:48.909
- Come on.
- We'll catch up.

01:33:52.627 --> 01:33:55.247
Wake the dead! Wake the dead!

01:33:56.589 --> 01:33:58.469
Uncle Atlas, wake up.

01:34:00.051 --> 01:34:03.431
- Come on, Aunt LaBorgia, wake up.
- No, no, no, children.

01:34:03.596 --> 01:34:06.926
You have to dig. That's half the fun.

01:34:18.444 --> 01:34:20.784
Oh, Tish, what more could we ask?

01:34:23.366 --> 01:34:24.736
Gomez.

01:34:30.790 --> 01:34:33.960
Cara Mia, is it true?

01:34:34.627 --> 01:34:35.707
Oui.

01:34:36.296 --> 01:34:37.586
Mon amour.

01:34:48.808 --> 01:34:51.098
Wake up, Grandpa Addams.
It's Halloween.

01:34:51.269 --> 01:34:53.729
Children, look! Great-Aunt Lavinia!

01:34:53.897 --> 01:34:56.437
She was beheaded by her own children!

01:34:56.608 --> 01:35:04.608
Yay!
