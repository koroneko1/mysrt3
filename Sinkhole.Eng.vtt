WEBVTT

01:05.315 --> 01:08.234
We've arrived.

01:08.318 --> 01:12.322
It's raining so much.
The movers must be having a hard time.

01:12.405 --> 01:13.907
Are they done already?

01:23.249 --> 01:24.292
Are you done already?

01:24.375 --> 01:26.753
-We haven't started yet.
-Why not?

01:26.836 --> 01:29.380
We need this car moved
to place the ladder,

01:29.464 --> 01:32.550
but he hasn't answered in an hour,
and no texts either.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.803
But it's raining so much…

01:40.558 --> 01:41.601
Hello? Hello…

01:42.977 --> 01:44.020
What the hell?

01:44.979 --> 01:46.106
So rude.

01:48.233 --> 01:50.276
I don't believe this guy.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.195
Christ.

02:15.510 --> 02:16.553
Jesus.

02:41.369 --> 02:42.245
Hey.

02:58.052 --> 02:58.928
You, there.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.561
-Me?
-Yeah, you.

03:06.644 --> 03:09.022
How could you not answer
when you were home?

03:09.105 --> 03:12.025
I couldn't move for an hour
because of your car.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.319
I left it on vibrate.

03:14.402 --> 03:16.279
The driver even announced it
on a megaphone.

03:16.362 --> 03:19.657
I didn't hear it.
Soundproofing is great here.

03:19.741 --> 03:21.117
Happy?

03:21.201 --> 03:22.493
I don't believe it.

03:23.328 --> 03:26.331
-About what?
-Is it so hard to apologize?

03:26.414 --> 03:28.958
Why should I apologize?

03:29.042 --> 03:30.960
You should be apologizing to me.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.296
You disturbed my Sunday morning sleep,

03:33.379 --> 03:36.466
made me waste gas
on a perfectly parked car,

03:36.549 --> 03:40.845
and you'll be noisy all day
moving your crap.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.514
-Am I right?
-Just use your words!

03:43.598 --> 03:45.141
I am.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.060
Then why poke me with your finger?

03:49.896 --> 03:52.482
You should work out.

03:53.524 --> 03:56.236
-What?
-You need to exercise.

03:56.319 --> 03:57.445
Honey.

03:59.739 --> 04:01.324
Good afternoon.

04:02.659 --> 04:06.704
This must be your family. Welcome.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.164
Are you fighting?

04:10.458 --> 04:14.837
Come on. Adults don't fight.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.214
We weren't fighting.

04:25.682 --> 04:27.475
Going up.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.735
Going down.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.907
It's raining cats and dogs.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.289
Are you moving in today?

04:49.372 --> 04:50.999
Yes, hello. Do you live here?

04:51.082 --> 04:53.876
-Yes.
-I'm 501. Nice to meet you.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.420
You as well.

04:56.504 --> 04:59.924
My goodness. They say you'll be rich
if you move on a rainy day.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.217
Thank you.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.346
-Okay, bye.
-Take care.

05:11.477 --> 05:12.895
HUN'S SNACK BAR

05:12.979 --> 05:14.772
-Hello, there.
-Hello.

05:15.523 --> 05:19.569
Seong-hun, when you're hungry,
microwave the rolls, okay?

05:19.652 --> 05:22.864
-Okay.
-And don't open the door to strangers.

05:22.947 --> 05:25.366
Okay. Hurry back.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.535
Close the window. You'll get wet.

05:27.618 --> 05:29.370
-Okay.
-Bye.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.469
So comfy.

05:45.511 --> 05:46.637
Because it's our home.

05:47.305 --> 05:49.432
What a pretty home.

05:50.099 --> 05:51.351
Because it's our home.

05:52.894 --> 05:56.272
So warm and cozy.

05:57.398 --> 06:00.068
-Because it's our home.
-Our home.

06:02.570 --> 06:05.573
Dad, when does the TV get hooked up?

06:05.656 --> 06:08.868
Su-chan, just look at our home.

06:09.619 --> 06:13.122
TV!

06:13.206 --> 06:15.583
-TV!
-Here, Su-chan.

06:17.835 --> 06:21.005
Now that you have time
before and after work,

06:21.089 --> 06:23.674
get some exercise and study English.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.802
Do everything that you want to do.

06:27.678 --> 06:30.723
We pay a maximum mortgage.
We're now penniless.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.767
I'll make the money for your lessons.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.981
Nice to hear
that your wife will bring home the dough?

06:39.065 --> 06:40.483
Yeah.

06:53.538 --> 06:57.417
First breakfast in years.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.086
Since the office is so close,
I get these perks.

07:00.169 --> 07:02.922
-Su-chan, breakfast.
-Okay.

07:03.005 --> 07:04.048
All right.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.135
Eat plenty.

07:07.218 --> 07:09.178
Wanna see something cool?

07:09.262 --> 07:10.763
What is it?

07:19.230 --> 07:22.483
The movers didn't do their jobs?
They didn't level the table?

07:22.567 --> 07:24.527
No. Same thing on the floor too.

07:26.237 --> 07:28.489
Hey, not in the middle of breakfast.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.838
PERFECT HEALTH GYM

07:58.728 --> 08:01.731
You don't have to look so surprised.

08:02.773 --> 08:04.275
I wasn't surprised at all.

08:04.358 --> 08:07.820
You totally were. Come. Come on in.

08:07.904 --> 08:11.574
You decided wisely. You need to work out.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.993
I'll give you a discount.

08:14.076 --> 08:15.870
Are you the boss here?

08:15.953 --> 08:20.082
No, but something similar.
I'm a personal trainer.

08:20.166 --> 08:24.545
I'm gonna be late. I'll think about it.

08:25.296 --> 08:28.716
What a stupid excuse.

08:29.967 --> 08:30.843
Excuse me.

08:31.636 --> 08:35.139
Good. You made the right call.

08:35.223 --> 08:36.516
No. By any chance…

08:36.599 --> 08:38.851
Yeah. Sign up by any chance.

08:38.935 --> 08:40.686
-Our home, home.
-What about it?

08:40.770 --> 08:42.647
Is our place tilted?

08:44.440 --> 08:46.108
Why would our building be tilted?

08:46.192 --> 08:50.071
For exanple, have you noticed
objects rolling around the living room?

08:50.154 --> 08:53.449
No. My living room is level.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.368
-If you have a marble--
-Hey!

08:56.494 --> 08:59.539
Do I look like
I play with marbles at my age?

08:59.622 --> 09:01.290
-No.
-Good. Then sign up.

09:01.374 --> 09:04.835
Late! I'm so late. What am I doing?

09:05.461 --> 09:06.921
What are you doing?

09:18.140 --> 09:19.350
-Mr. Park?
-Yeah?

09:19.433 --> 09:22.520
-I heard you bought a home in Seoul.
-Yeah.

09:22.603 --> 09:24.730
Congrats. Why didn't you tell us?

09:24.814 --> 09:26.857
Congratulations.

09:27.483 --> 09:29.485
It's no biggie.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.363
-Congratulations.
-Thank you all.

09:33.614 --> 09:37.410
For becoming a homeowner
and a citizen of Seoul,

09:37.493 --> 09:38.911
a round of applause.

09:40.538 --> 09:44.333
Applause. He bought a home.

09:45.001 --> 09:48.546
Stop it. It's not a big deal.

09:48.629 --> 09:50.298
-Which district?
-Jangsu.

09:51.507 --> 09:54.594
Where Jangsu Industrial Park is?

09:55.469 --> 09:56.762
It went away long ago.

09:56.846 --> 10:00.266
When I was young,
my dad scrapped his car there.

10:00.349 --> 10:03.811
The junkyards disappeared a long time ago.

10:03.894 --> 10:05.396
It's an eco-friendly area now.

10:05.479 --> 10:08.482
Didn't people protest there
over subway noise?

10:09.650 --> 10:13.029
Why would there be subway noise?
It's a new building,

10:13.112 --> 10:16.073
with two or three layers of soundproofing.

10:16.157 --> 10:19.452
Even if a war breaks out,
we wouldn't know.

10:20.536 --> 10:22.747
-Is that your home?
-No.

10:25.124 --> 10:27.877
Look at that ball roll all by itself.

10:28.836 --> 10:32.048
Is that a living room or a soccer field?

10:32.131 --> 10:35.259
When should we have a housewarming party?

10:35.968 --> 10:39.639
-Faster the better.
-Okay, I got your vote.

10:39.722 --> 10:40.890
Get back to work.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.857
You're gonna break it.

10:54.820 --> 11:00.034
If the home is tilted,
the frame will be misaligned.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.669
Are you satisfied?

11:16.175 --> 11:17.426
Excuse me?

11:19.178 --> 11:20.429
Anyone here?

11:21.931 --> 11:23.349
Did you make an appointment?

11:23.432 --> 11:25.851
Did it online. Fifty percent off.

11:26.977 --> 11:28.979
-Very good.
-Me too!

11:31.357 --> 11:34.276
Wouldn't it look nice
on our wall like that?

11:35.486 --> 11:37.905
-It looks good.
-Right?

11:37.988 --> 11:42.910
The photographer is really good.
He must be a cool guy.

11:42.993 --> 11:44.495
Hello?

11:53.796 --> 11:55.506
You're always surprised to see me.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.637
Where's the owner?

12:04.682 --> 12:07.268
-I'm the owner.
-Good afternoon.

12:07.351 --> 12:10.229
Good afternoon.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.232
What a cutie.

12:13.315 --> 12:14.817
What about the gym upstairs?

12:14.900 --> 12:19.488
A friend runs that. I sometimes help out.

12:20.573 --> 12:21.949
But this is my main business.

12:22.032 --> 12:24.243
You look handsome.

12:24.744 --> 12:25.619
Set.

12:26.912 --> 12:27.747
Set.

12:28.831 --> 12:31.375
Good composition.

12:31.459 --> 12:35.546
Ma'am, your figure is lovely.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.967
Sir, are you uncomfortable?

12:40.050 --> 12:41.343
Could you just take it?

12:43.929 --> 12:48.017
Okay, I'll capture your stiff face

12:48.517 --> 12:51.270
in this harmonious family photo.

12:51.353 --> 12:52.646
What a shame.

12:53.564 --> 12:54.648
Smile, please.

12:58.068 --> 13:01.280
Very good. Here we go.

13:04.325 --> 13:07.286
That's perfect. Very good.

13:08.496 --> 13:10.831
Seoul looks prettier in the rain.

13:12.625 --> 13:17.171
We moved here with nothing,
and it took us 11 years to buy our home.

13:18.172 --> 13:19.590
You did well.

13:20.257 --> 13:22.051
It's all thanks to you.

13:23.052 --> 13:26.138
I'm more thankful. Let's drink.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.306
I have to drive.

13:27.389 --> 13:30.100
We're in Seoul. We can get temp drivers.

13:30.184 --> 13:32.394
-I'll pay.
-Shall we, then?

13:32.478 --> 13:33.896
Drink.

13:33.979 --> 13:35.189
Me too.

13:35.272 --> 13:36.190
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

13:36.273 --> 13:38.108
Where are you?

13:38.192 --> 13:40.778
I'm almost there. I see you.

13:41.362 --> 13:42.196
I see you.

13:46.992 --> 13:50.830
I'll do my utmost
to drive you home safely.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.749
Good evening.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.709
Hey, there. Good evening.

13:55.793 --> 13:57.002
Good evening.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.213
Surprised again.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.842
Speed limit is 60 kilometers an hour
up ahead.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.134
Stop.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.012
Stop!

14:07.096 --> 14:09.431
The camera. It caught us.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.810
-The red-light camera got us.
-Not at all.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.020
I saw the flash go off.

14:15.104 --> 14:17.106
No, it didn't get us.

14:17.189 --> 14:20.150
You should've stopped at yellow.
Why didn't you?

14:20.234 --> 14:24.154
Some stop at yellow,
others drive through it.

14:24.822 --> 14:26.323
I drive through yellow.

14:26.407 --> 14:28.534
The traffic law states that you must stop.

14:28.617 --> 14:30.369
You can drive through.

14:32.621 --> 14:35.583
I'm gonna find it. I'll find the clause.

14:37.668 --> 14:38.669
I found it.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.130
Here.

14:42.172 --> 14:44.675
See? Take a look.

14:44.758 --> 14:46.343
We've arrived.

14:46.927 --> 14:49.263
It states that one must stop
at a yellow light.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.641
Su-chan, welcome home.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.519
-Thank you.
-Head on inside.

14:57.855 --> 14:58.731
Look here.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.320
Do you need anything?

15:04.403 --> 15:06.780
We all pooled our money
to buy you something.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.908
-How much?
-Under 200,000 won please.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.284
Two hundred thosand won?

15:11.577 --> 15:14.663
Can you go help her?

15:16.081 --> 15:17.917
Eun-ju, leave that. I'll take care of it.

15:19.126 --> 15:21.503
-It's okay. I can do it…
-Okay.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.258
Damn that giraffe.

15:27.927 --> 15:31.305
A blender or a hot-water pad.

15:31.388 --> 15:34.266
-Can't I just get it in cash?
-I'm gonna engrave your name on it.

15:34.350 --> 15:35.851
Give me the cash.

15:35.935 --> 15:39.021
There's something I want,
but I'm a little short.

15:40.606 --> 15:41.857
What's this?

15:45.527 --> 15:47.947
A housewarming gift from my colleagues.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.365
It looks expensive.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.283
Who knows?

15:51.367 --> 15:53.911
I do all the hard work,
and you get awarded?

15:54.745 --> 15:57.414
It's for everyone.

15:57.498 --> 15:58.874
Dad, I wanna try it.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.835
-No kids allowed.
-Boo!

16:02.336 --> 16:06.507
Let him try it.
You said it's for everyone.

16:06.590 --> 16:08.467
Not for the wife either.

16:10.344 --> 16:12.680
You can sleep there till the end.

16:13.639 --> 16:14.515
Let's go.

16:56.015 --> 16:59.810
Wait a minute. How did this happen?

16:59.893 --> 17:02.021
I don't think it was a rock…

17:03.939 --> 17:05.357
Slammed into it?

17:12.531 --> 17:13.657
Sir!

17:15.242 --> 17:16.285
It wasn't me.

17:16.368 --> 17:18.620
Then who else?

17:19.288 --> 17:21.582
It really wasn't me.

17:21.665 --> 17:24.918
Replace it soon. Should I report it?

17:25.002 --> 17:26.879
Report me for what?

17:26.962 --> 17:28.213
What's that look?

17:28.297 --> 17:30.841
Have fun then.

17:30.924 --> 17:32.301
I'll clean it up, but…

17:32.384 --> 17:34.136
Having the right neighbors
is so important.

17:46.982 --> 17:49.860
It's a new five-story building.

17:50.360 --> 17:53.572
Can the city conduct a safety inspection?

17:54.239 --> 17:55.491
Repairing defects?

17:57.284 --> 18:02.414
Have a meeting with residents
and get everyone's consent?

18:05.876 --> 18:09.755
It's a defect repair procedure.

18:09.838 --> 18:13.383
To be honest, there are some problems.

18:13.467 --> 18:14.718
What's wrong with it?

18:14.802 --> 18:18.138
All the windows are hard to open,
and the building is not level.

18:18.222 --> 18:21.433
It means the building is tilted.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.686
-How could it tilt?
-Isn't our home okay?

18:24.770 --> 18:27.689
If there are rumors of defects,
our home values will drop.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.442
Our windows are also stiff.

18:30.526 --> 18:31.819
How's 202? Are you okay?

18:33.112 --> 18:35.823
I'm rarely home because of my shop.

18:35.906 --> 18:37.282
What about 502?

18:37.366 --> 18:41.245
I get so much cigarette smoke
from downstairs

18:41.328 --> 18:43.747
that I don't remember
the last time I opened my windows.

18:44.623 --> 18:45.874
Did you hear that, 401?

18:50.045 --> 18:51.672
No one at my home smokes.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.591
Who else would smoke then?

18:54.675 --> 18:58.345
You look like a chain smoker
even at first glance, no?

18:58.428 --> 19:00.347
What the…

19:01.640 --> 19:05.269
I quit smoking years ago. I don't smell.

19:06.103 --> 19:08.021
Smell me then.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.399
I smell it. Can you tell?

19:10.482 --> 19:13.068
Stop. No need to fight.

19:13.152 --> 19:16.905
So she's the one wearing the pants, huh?

19:16.989 --> 19:19.700
Please, let's not argue. Stop arguing!

19:19.783 --> 19:23.370
She's making accusations!
I hate getting accused more than anything!

19:24.329 --> 19:26.582
I don't believe this.

19:30.961 --> 19:32.671
I'll enroll you

19:32.754 --> 19:36.258
into a civil servant academy next month,
so don't worry.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.135
You don't have any money.

19:38.677 --> 19:42.556
I got so many calls
after handing out flyers.

19:49.062 --> 19:51.023
If you need to smoke,

19:51.899 --> 19:54.151
smoke on the roof.

19:54.776 --> 19:56.737
The people upstairs
complained about the smell.

19:57.237 --> 20:00.490
They were making
a lot of fuss over nothing.

20:01.450 --> 20:02.284
I don't smoke.

20:03.368 --> 20:06.121
Right? You don't smoke. I knew it.

20:06.205 --> 20:09.416
I've had it with 502.

20:09.499 --> 20:12.961
Seung-tae, I'll shut up. Finish your meal.

20:21.303 --> 20:22.304
So?

20:22.387 --> 20:24.681
-Get the presents.
-Clean neighborhood, right?

20:24.765 --> 20:26.767
It's quiet. Nice place to raise kids.

20:27.809 --> 20:29.436
Very calm.

20:33.815 --> 20:35.025
What's this?

20:35.108 --> 20:38.237
The lady in 301 kept complaining.

20:39.112 --> 20:42.574
It's plastic used for making kimchi.
It won't be noticeable.

20:42.658 --> 20:43.951
It's super noticeable.

20:44.618 --> 20:47.704
Yeah, of course it's a little noticeable.
It's not glass.

20:48.413 --> 20:50.791
You're really anal.

20:50.874 --> 20:53.210
I haven't seen
a plastic sheet like that in so long.

20:53.293 --> 20:55.170
Having a housewarming, huh?

20:55.254 --> 20:57.589
Yes. Hello.
We're the department chief's colleagues.

20:58.966 --> 21:00.759
You're a department chief?

21:00.842 --> 21:02.177
Good work.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.137
One second.

21:04.221 --> 21:06.682
I found some defects. Take a look.

21:10.560 --> 21:13.563
The garbage area there,
it's got some cracks.

21:13.647 --> 21:17.776
And more at the entrance
of the parking lot, see?

21:17.859 --> 21:22.072
Upon closer inspection,
this building is a mess.

21:22.155 --> 21:23.282
Another one here.

21:23.365 --> 21:25.117
This is the current situation?

21:25.200 --> 21:27.494
It's so current. It's happening right now.

21:27.577 --> 21:30.205
It's not a problem now,
but it'll be a problem later.

21:30.289 --> 21:33.000
-This is bad. Look at that.
-I got more. Look.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.584
Great work. Thank you.

21:34.668 --> 21:37.838
Look at it. Cracks all over.

21:37.921 --> 21:39.840
Right here.

21:39.923 --> 21:41.300
Just look at that.

21:43.093 --> 21:44.845
That's really bad.

21:44.928 --> 21:46.013
Can people live here?

21:46.096 --> 21:49.182
No need to buzz in.
You can go in like this.

21:49.266 --> 21:50.267
Go ahead.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.147
All right.

21:56.023 --> 21:57.024
There you go.

21:57.107 --> 21:59.276
-Thank you.
-So many gifts…

21:59.359 --> 22:01.695
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

22:01.778 --> 22:03.238
Good afternoon.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.115
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

22:05.949 --> 22:07.743
Please come in.

22:07.826 --> 22:10.203
-It's huge and spacious.
-Please come in.

22:10.287 --> 22:12.247
-Smells so good.
-I didn't prepare much.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.666
-Come in.
-Hello.

22:14.750 --> 22:15.751
Hello.

22:17.669 --> 22:19.171
How much do you think that costs?

22:21.757 --> 22:25.344
-Three billion won?
-Incredible.

22:25.427 --> 22:27.304
What's incredible?

22:27.387 --> 22:28.263
That.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.350
Doesn't it look like Everest?

22:31.850 --> 22:34.144
You know where it is,
but it's unreachable.

22:38.648 --> 22:40.817
You can't buy that
even after winning the lottery.

22:40.901 --> 22:44.654
Think I don't know
those apartments are good?

22:45.614 --> 22:48.658
I don't buy it because I can't.

22:48.742 --> 22:54.873
You still should've done it,
even if you had to take out a huge loan.

22:56.708 --> 22:59.628
His mother bought one this year
for 450 million won.

22:59.711 --> 23:02.672
-Don't talk about that.
-It went up by 200 million in six months.

23:02.756 --> 23:04.633
-Two hundred million?
-Two hundred million.

23:04.716 --> 23:07.552
-Two hundred million?
-Two hundred million.

23:08.136 --> 23:11.390
-Yes.
-Went up by 200 million won…

23:12.432 --> 23:15.685
Damn, my mortgage was…

23:22.109 --> 23:22.984
Eun-ju!

23:26.029 --> 23:28.532
Don't leave your seat when drinking.

23:28.615 --> 23:29.491
Come back.

23:30.659 --> 23:32.494
I want to be alone.

23:33.245 --> 23:34.496
All of sudden?

23:35.288 --> 23:36.289
Yes.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.794
Her glass is empty.

23:40.877 --> 23:43.547
Seung-hyeon,
go fill her cup and bring her over.

23:45.507 --> 23:46.758
Where are you going?

23:47.342 --> 23:48.718
Bathroom.

23:48.802 --> 23:50.929
I gotta get the watermelon
from the fridge.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.934
Jeong. Why aren't you drinking?

23:56.017 --> 23:58.645
I have to drive later. Coke's fine.

23:58.728 --> 24:00.147
I'll get you a temp driver.

24:00.230 --> 24:01.731
I only drank Coke all night.

24:01.815 --> 24:03.108
-It's all right.
-It's okay.

24:03.191 --> 24:04.651
-I know a guy.
-Crap.

24:04.734 --> 24:06.153
YELLOW LIGHT TEMP DRIVER

24:06.236 --> 24:07.237
Let me see.

24:07.821 --> 24:08.864
Here it is.

24:08.947 --> 24:12.033
-Super fast.
-I'm taking herbal medicine.

24:12.117 --> 24:14.953
-It's all right.
-I'm really okay. Please.

24:25.088 --> 24:26.298
What?

24:27.674 --> 24:29.676
I'll drive you home safely.

24:45.901 --> 24:47.319
You're here! You came!

24:47.402 --> 24:48.987
Good thing you called.

24:49.070 --> 24:51.615
You mustn't drive
after drinking like this.

24:51.698 --> 24:55.035
He's someone who runs yellow lights,

24:55.118 --> 24:57.954
so watch him carefully, got it?

24:58.038 --> 24:59.414
Honey?

25:00.874 --> 25:03.460
-Did you have dinner?
-I'll have some.

25:04.377 --> 25:05.212
Okay.

25:10.592 --> 25:12.469
-Bro.
-Yeah?

25:13.261 --> 25:15.931
The plastic sheet guy is here.

25:16.014 --> 25:17.682
Let me offer you a drink.

25:17.766 --> 25:19.976
No. I have to drive.

25:20.060 --> 25:22.604
I have your dinner ready.

25:23.104 --> 25:24.898
Shall I, then?

25:24.981 --> 25:27.108
Have a drink. Cheers.

25:27.192 --> 25:28.860
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

25:28.944 --> 25:31.321
Jeong, why aren't you drinking?

25:31.404 --> 25:32.822
Since the driver's here…

25:32.906 --> 25:34.991
All right. Then cheers.

25:49.047 --> 25:50.590
Why are you whispering?

25:52.217 --> 25:53.677
What was that about?

25:56.137 --> 25:58.473
-Are you two dating?
-Nope.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.352
-No way.
-Come on, Mr. Park.

26:02.435 --> 26:04.062
You're talking nonsense.

26:04.145 --> 26:05.438
Nonsense?

26:06.106 --> 26:08.316
You're gravely mistaken.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.651
I am?

26:10.235 --> 26:11.278
Are you drunk?

26:11.361 --> 26:12.654
No, sir.

26:15.699 --> 26:16.950
We're in love.

26:21.955 --> 26:23.999
You son of a bitch!

26:24.082 --> 26:26.334
What's wrong? They're dating.

26:26.418 --> 26:27.460
I'm sorry, Mr. Kim.

26:27.544 --> 26:31.131
Don't say my name. You're dead to me.

26:32.966 --> 26:35.844
Hyo-jeong. Hey!

26:35.927 --> 26:37.762
Don't say her name, asshole!

26:37.846 --> 26:39.973
Wait. I need to drive you.

26:43.101 --> 26:45.437
Seung-hyeon, don't go!
You'll feel more pitiful!

26:54.446 --> 26:55.655
Drink.

26:56.906 --> 26:57.991
Just drink.

27:02.370 --> 27:05.457
You should head home too.

27:05.540 --> 27:08.710
One mustn't overstay one's welcome.

27:09.377 --> 27:10.503
Where do you live?

27:11.838 --> 27:14.007
-Junggye district.
-Junggye…

27:14.591 --> 27:16.885
Rocking chair lady, where do you live?

27:17.844 --> 27:20.513
-Anyang.
-I see.

27:20.597 --> 27:22.807
Give me your keys.
I'll hit Anyang, then Junggye.

27:24.351 --> 27:26.019
I didn't bring a car.

27:27.103 --> 27:27.937
Why not?

27:30.190 --> 27:31.691
I don't have one.

27:35.236 --> 27:39.491
Then let's take my car, hit Anyang,
Junggye, and back to Jangsu.

27:39.574 --> 27:42.952
That's 40,000 and 50,000, so 90,000.
but I'll give it to you for 80,000 won.

27:43.036 --> 27:44.329
Eighty thousand won?

27:45.538 --> 27:47.332
That's the gas cost.

27:48.083 --> 27:50.919
Stay the night. I got three rooms.

27:51.544 --> 27:52.671
Wow.

27:53.171 --> 27:55.507
You need to get home.

27:55.590 --> 27:58.760
Your parents must be so worried, no?

27:59.344 --> 28:00.512
I live alone.

28:01.638 --> 28:04.224
Oh, alone…

28:04.307 --> 28:05.725
I've got three rooms.

28:05.809 --> 28:07.936
Su-chan sleeps in his room,

28:08.019 --> 28:10.647
my wife and I sleep in the master bedroom,

28:10.730 --> 28:14.067
and Seung-hyeon and Eun-ju
can sleep in the guest room…

28:14.150 --> 28:15.318
What?

28:15.402 --> 28:16.653
Once more.

28:17.445 --> 28:18.279
Once more--

28:19.823 --> 28:22.242
Su-chan sleeps in his room,

28:22.325 --> 28:24.536
you and Seung-hyeon sleep in the master,

28:24.619 --> 28:27.747
your wife and that single lady
sleep in guest room.

28:28.915 --> 28:31.459
And I sleep in my own damn bed!

28:31.543 --> 28:33.461
This guy is so smart!

28:35.004 --> 28:36.339
Where's Jeong?

28:37.882 --> 28:40.552
-Very good.
-Careful.

28:44.556 --> 28:46.057
Mom, careful.

28:48.268 --> 28:50.145
Hey, we're heading out now.

28:50.228 --> 28:52.313
I forgot about a meeting I have to attend.

28:52.397 --> 28:55.775
You know Mom doesn't forget Saturday.

28:56.401 --> 28:59.154
She waits all week long
to go to the bathhouse.

28:59.237 --> 29:00.947
Then take her yourself.

29:03.575 --> 29:05.785
Fine. I'll take care of it.

29:06.286 --> 29:10.582
HONEY

29:10.665 --> 29:13.168
Your call cannot be connected…

29:13.251 --> 29:15.211
-No answer.
-Try again.

29:15.837 --> 29:17.005
Good morning.

29:17.088 --> 29:19.591
You're so courteous.

29:19.674 --> 29:20.759
Yep.

29:21.676 --> 29:23.970
Oh no. Got no water either?

29:24.053 --> 29:25.013
No.

29:25.597 --> 29:28.349
Since there's no running water,
we're going on vacation.

29:28.433 --> 29:29.517
To the sauna.

29:32.812 --> 29:34.606
A two-day sauna vacation.

29:34.689 --> 29:35.940
That must be nice.

29:36.024 --> 29:39.652
I guess our building does have defects.

29:39.736 --> 29:42.280
-Will you stop talking about that?
-Why?

29:42.363 --> 29:43.239
Let's get going.

29:43.823 --> 29:45.909
-Okay.
-Goodbye.

29:45.992 --> 29:48.495
-Take care!
-Bye.

29:50.580 --> 29:56.211
Mom, since he's not answering,
should I go fetch a cart?

29:56.294 --> 29:57.712
-Can you do it?
-Yep.

29:58.296 --> 30:00.799
My son's all grown up.

30:00.882 --> 30:01.966
-Yep.
-Go ahead.

30:03.718 --> 30:05.845
-Careful.
-Okay.

30:20.944 --> 30:22.362
Dang it.

30:23.196 --> 30:25.156
I just have to cross a bridge.

30:25.698 --> 30:26.741
I see you.

30:28.409 --> 30:30.411
-Please hurry.
-Okay.

30:31.079 --> 30:34.624
It's rush hour, so the road's packed.

30:36.334 --> 30:37.710
Oh, today's Saturday.

30:41.256 --> 30:42.924
Sir, be careful!

30:45.176 --> 30:46.636
I'll be right there.

30:49.806 --> 30:53.768
Sir, I actually left my bag.

30:53.852 --> 30:57.981
Could you turn around and wait?
I'll be right back. I'm sorry.

31:01.067 --> 31:02.443
I'll be back shortly.

31:05.697 --> 31:06.906
Dang it.

31:32.098 --> 31:34.517
Hello? Anyone home?

31:35.184 --> 31:37.061
Do you have running water?

31:43.318 --> 31:45.737
Why is no one home?

31:56.915 --> 31:57.790
Eun-ju.

32:00.418 --> 32:01.878
Eun-ju, my bag…

32:04.213 --> 32:05.048
Eun-ju.

32:06.007 --> 32:09.302
-Good morning.
-Hey there.

32:11.554 --> 32:13.264
-Su-chan.
-Yeah?

32:13.348 --> 32:17.393
If you see me a dozen times a day,
will you greet me a dozen times?

32:17.477 --> 32:18.436
Yes.

32:18.519 --> 32:21.439
The son is so courteous and respectful,

32:21.522 --> 32:24.901
but the father is a jerk face.

32:24.984 --> 32:26.861
Dad is sleeping.

32:26.945 --> 32:30.114
-Su-chan, do you have running water?
-Nope.

32:31.824 --> 32:32.659
502 NOT HOME

32:32.742 --> 32:35.411
Jerk face…

32:44.587 --> 32:45.505
I'm so tired.

32:46.464 --> 32:49.092
Which bastard was smoking on the roof?

32:52.178 --> 32:56.432
Is this the pump room?

33:11.155 --> 33:12.532
Sorry about that.

33:13.116 --> 33:16.661
I'm not a chump. I'll take care of it.

33:16.744 --> 33:18.121
I don't believe it.

33:19.747 --> 33:20.832
I'm running out of time.

33:31.634 --> 33:34.137
Hello there, sir.

33:34.220 --> 33:36.139
Do you have running water
in your building?

33:36.222 --> 33:38.850
We got jack shit.

33:42.311 --> 33:45.398
-Good flow.
-We got water.

33:45.481 --> 33:48.026
That's enough. No need to spray me.

33:48.109 --> 33:49.444
Please stop.

34:17.638 --> 34:18.473
What the hell?

34:41.204 --> 34:42.330
Help me!

34:47.835 --> 34:50.379
Sir, please call 911!

34:59.764 --> 35:00.598
Mom…

35:12.610 --> 35:15.571
Sir, call 911!

35:58.865 --> 36:01.159
Yeong-yi. Su-chan!

36:02.076 --> 36:03.077
Su-chan.

36:51.959 --> 36:53.085
Where are you?

36:53.169 --> 36:55.630
Byeong-cheol, listen to me very carefully.

36:57.298 --> 36:59.050
I don't think
I can emcee your wedding today.

36:59.133 --> 37:01.093
What are you saying?

37:01.177 --> 37:02.637
I'm buried deep underground.

37:02.720 --> 37:05.514
Get buried for good, asshole.

37:05.598 --> 37:07.141
I'm serious, punk!

37:07.225 --> 37:08.392
Call 911!

37:37.129 --> 37:38.256
What the hell!

37:52.561 --> 37:54.313
Please save me.

38:03.197 --> 38:06.367
Come on, taxi! Save me and take me home.

38:15.501 --> 38:16.669
Don't come.

38:18.963 --> 38:20.423
Stop!

38:35.730 --> 38:37.148
What the hell is this cab?

38:41.110 --> 38:42.069
Rocking chair.

38:45.614 --> 38:47.241
Mr. Park. Help me!

38:47.325 --> 38:49.577
Why are you in there?

38:49.660 --> 38:51.746
I don't really know. Open this door!

38:51.829 --> 38:53.164
Right, the door.

38:55.082 --> 38:57.209
Sir, pull. Don't move, taxi.

38:57.293 --> 39:01.672
Pull! Please! Pull! Harder!

39:04.884 --> 39:05.718
Seung-hyeon!

39:06.302 --> 39:08.012
Son of a bitch!

39:08.596 --> 39:09.680
Seung-hyeon.

39:11.223 --> 39:14.477
-You're a killer.
-Don't give up. I'll save you.

39:14.560 --> 39:16.604
-Seung-hyeon.
-Please! No!

39:22.860 --> 39:23.944
Seung-hyeon!

39:24.653 --> 39:26.280
Seung-hyeon!

39:27.615 --> 39:28.824
Seung-hyeon.

39:47.802 --> 39:49.178
Get out.

39:59.688 --> 40:01.023
Thank you, Mr. Park.

40:01.732 --> 40:02.691
Hello?

40:03.734 --> 40:05.528
-Honey?
-Help me!

40:05.611 --> 40:06.737
Yeong-yi!

40:09.865 --> 40:10.825
Sir…

40:12.034 --> 40:12.910
Honey!

40:15.788 --> 40:17.498
What the…

40:20.626 --> 40:21.544
Eun-ju?

40:23.087 --> 40:25.005
-You okay?
-Yes.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.466
Have you seen my family?

40:33.848 --> 40:36.100
How long
until the rescue team can descend?

40:36.183 --> 40:37.601
At least a day, sir.

40:37.685 --> 40:40.271
Evacuate the residents
and verify casualties.

40:40.354 --> 40:41.522
Right away, sir.

40:50.906 --> 40:53.492
POLICE

41:58.390 --> 42:00.726
I'm alive. I made it.

42:04.021 --> 42:08.067
-Su-chan! Over here!
-Are you in there?

42:08.150 --> 42:10.778
I saw him! I saw the boy…

42:11.529 --> 42:12.530
Su-chan…

42:21.288 --> 42:23.582
-Who are you?
-I saw him.

42:26.377 --> 42:29.672
I was in front of 502,
and he came out of your home.

42:29.755 --> 42:34.677
I saw him get on the elevator,
and I went to the roof.

42:35.678 --> 42:38.639
This happened a few minutes after that…

42:41.642 --> 42:43.936
Su-chan should be safe.

42:44.603 --> 42:45.521
He should be okay.

42:46.188 --> 42:47.648
Thank you, sir.

42:47.731 --> 42:48.649
Thank you.

42:49.608 --> 42:51.902
Stop it. It hurts.

42:53.487 --> 42:55.823
Seung-tae. Where is he?

42:56.407 --> 42:58.576
Seung-tae, my son!

42:58.659 --> 42:59.868
Seung-tae!

42:59.952 --> 43:01.579
-Who's Seung-tae?
-Seung-tae!

43:01.662 --> 43:03.872
-Seung-tae!
-Seung-tae!

43:03.956 --> 43:04.790
This way.

43:06.917 --> 43:08.711
-Seung-tae!
-Over here.

43:11.463 --> 43:12.339
Seung-tae!

43:15.009 --> 43:16.510
-Seung-tae.
-Seung-tae.

43:18.929 --> 43:20.431
Seung-tae.

43:26.437 --> 43:28.439
-Seung-tae!
-Seung-tae!

43:29.607 --> 43:30.608
Seung-tae!

43:31.108 --> 43:34.361
New… New Balance.

43:35.154 --> 43:38.198
New Balance!

43:38.282 --> 43:39.241
New what?

43:39.825 --> 43:40.993
What balance?

43:45.998 --> 43:49.335
No New Balance!

43:49.418 --> 43:51.795
No New Balance…

43:51.879 --> 43:53.797
Whose sneakers?

43:53.881 --> 43:58.260
Seung-tae's shoes aren't here.
He must've gone to the Internet café.

43:58.344 --> 44:00.804
Very good. He did a good thing.

44:05.059 --> 44:07.394
This really must be a sinkhole.

44:07.478 --> 44:11.148
-Sinkhole?
-Looks like we dropped about 500 meters.

44:11.231 --> 44:13.359
It wasn't an earthquake or a war?

44:13.442 --> 44:14.943
I'm sure it's a sinkhole.

44:15.027 --> 44:16.403
Where are you going?

44:16.904 --> 44:18.989
We might a get signal on the roof.

44:19.073 --> 44:21.116
You might get your head busted.

44:21.617 --> 44:24.870
-We should go too.
-I'm not going. It's dangerous.

44:24.953 --> 44:27.456
But you're a yellow-light runner.

44:27.539 --> 44:30.834
This is a red light. You must stop.

44:32.169 --> 44:35.047
The ground is unstable.
Do not drop your guard.

44:51.355 --> 44:52.481
Danger! Pull!

45:00.781 --> 45:01.782
Pull them up!

45:08.706 --> 45:10.749
Get the ambulance and evacuate at once!

45:19.758 --> 45:23.429
-Careful.
-It's dangerous. Be careful.

45:23.512 --> 45:25.139
Don't go.

45:25.222 --> 45:26.432
It's dangerous there.

45:27.766 --> 45:29.727
-You're not going?
-I…

45:29.810 --> 45:31.937
-You stay right here.
-Thank you.

45:32.020 --> 45:34.648
-Eun-ju, do you have a signal?
-I got nothing.

45:34.732 --> 45:35.941
-Be thorough.
-Okay.

45:36.024 --> 45:37.985
You'll find the spot.

45:41.155 --> 45:42.990
Have you seen anything like this?

45:45.325 --> 45:48.162
-I've seen it before.
-When?

45:48.245 --> 45:51.415
When I was nine, I fell into a well.

45:51.498 --> 45:53.375
-A well?
-Yes.

45:56.253 --> 45:59.298
I crawled out of there.
I can do it here too.

45:59.381 --> 46:01.633
Help! Please help!

46:01.717 --> 46:04.386
We're trapped down here! Help!

46:04.470 --> 46:06.555
-Please help!
-Please help!

46:06.638 --> 46:07.639
Send help!

46:07.723 --> 46:11.143
-Help us!
-Help!

46:11.226 --> 46:13.896
Help!

46:21.862 --> 46:26.950
You should've gone home
when I offered to drive you.

46:28.160 --> 46:30.287
Eighty thousand won isn't all that much.

46:30.370 --> 46:31.705
What do you mean?

46:32.289 --> 46:37.669
I offered to drive you
and that single lady.

46:37.753 --> 46:40.005
I could've hit Anyang, then Junggye.

46:40.088 --> 46:42.549
It would've cost you 80,000
instead of 90,000.

46:42.633 --> 46:45.260
But you said it was too expensive

46:45.344 --> 46:46.845
and you didn't want to leave.

46:48.722 --> 46:49.890
I did?

46:50.599 --> 46:52.434
No, your boss did.

46:53.018 --> 46:53.852
Me?

46:54.895 --> 46:56.814
You don't remember?

46:57.606 --> 46:59.566
You were so drunk and said,

46:59.650 --> 47:01.652
"Eighty thousand won?"

47:02.820 --> 47:03.904
You said that shit.

47:03.987 --> 47:05.614
Eun-ju, did I say that?

47:06.865 --> 47:07.699
Yes.

47:19.503 --> 47:21.004
Wait.

47:21.088 --> 47:23.382
I need help! Over here!

47:23.465 --> 47:26.510
-That voice sounds familiar.
-I'm over here!

47:29.555 --> 47:32.266
-Is that you, Seung-tae?
-Over here!

47:32.933 --> 47:34.268
Dad!

47:35.185 --> 47:36.478
-Son. Hang in there.
-Dad!

47:40.274 --> 47:43.026
Seung-tae!

47:43.110 --> 47:46.029
-Was it an earthquake?
-It's a sinkhole.

47:46.113 --> 47:47.865
-Sinkhole?
-Yeah.

47:50.576 --> 47:53.787
-You weren't at the Internet café?
-I quit gaming.

47:54.538 --> 47:57.165
-What were you doing up here?
-Getting some air.

47:57.249 --> 47:59.626
Why didn't you go to the Internet café?

47:59.710 --> 48:01.295
You told me not to go.

48:01.378 --> 48:04.715
Of all days, why did you listen to me?

48:05.799 --> 48:06.758
My goodness.

48:07.634 --> 48:09.177
Are you hurt at all?

48:11.388 --> 48:12.347
Are you okay?

48:15.809 --> 48:19.479
Let's think about
what we should do from here.

48:20.188 --> 48:25.402
We're in a disaster.
Let's look for survival supplies.

48:26.361 --> 48:28.947
Things like water, food,
first aid and dry sheets.

48:29.990 --> 48:32.200
Then we have to let people know
we're alive down here,

48:32.284 --> 48:34.453
so we'll take turns to stay here

48:34.536 --> 48:37.080
and send a flashlight signal
when we see someone up there.

48:37.164 --> 48:38.415
Where did you learn all that?

48:38.498 --> 48:40.834
I learned it on YouTube from Bear Grylls.

48:45.714 --> 48:47.841
-That's weird.
-What is?

48:47.925 --> 48:50.469
He doesn't have any friends.

48:50.552 --> 48:54.598
He's always at Internet cafés
or on his PC at home.

48:55.933 --> 48:57.267
Maybe a foreigner.

48:58.644 --> 49:00.938
But he doesn't speak English.

49:02.064 --> 49:03.482
We're never getting out.

49:07.778 --> 49:10.364
The area surrounding the sinkhole
is extremely dangerous,

49:10.447 --> 49:12.658
so it's hard to figure out
what's happening inside.

49:12.741 --> 49:16.495
Once we evacuate everyone here,
we'll attempt to head down,

49:16.578 --> 49:19.539
so please trust us and be patient.

49:20.958 --> 49:22.501
Please help them.

49:23.543 --> 49:25.379
We'll do our best.

49:28.131 --> 49:31.885
First, we need to figure out
who's inside the sinkhole.

49:31.969 --> 49:33.845
Please state their names one at a time.

49:33.929 --> 49:37.557
Lee Seong-hun, ten years old,
apartment 202.

49:38.225 --> 49:42.771
Park Dong-won, 37, 501.

49:59.913 --> 50:01.331
I'm sorry, Seung-hyeon.

50:04.876 --> 50:06.128
And you too, Eun-ju.

50:12.968 --> 50:15.220
I shouldn't have had a housewarming.

50:16.972 --> 50:19.599
I never imagined I'd die in your home.

50:20.851 --> 50:22.227
You're not gonna die.

50:23.103 --> 50:25.939
It took 11 years to buy this place,
and this happened after two weeks.

50:26.440 --> 50:29.359
It's too unfair for me to die.
So don't even think about dying.

50:29.443 --> 50:30.902
I try not to think about it…

50:34.573 --> 50:36.283
but I keep seeing myself die.

50:37.826 --> 50:40.495
Think about Hyo-jeong. You like her.

50:42.539 --> 50:43.623
What's the point?

50:45.208 --> 50:46.251
She's going out with Jeong.

50:46.334 --> 50:50.422
It's not like they're getting married.
Get out and tell her how you feel.

50:50.505 --> 50:52.924
You heard him.
Jeong's got an apartment too.

50:54.634 --> 50:57.345
I rent a studio apartment.

50:57.429 --> 50:59.056
You can't date if you're not a homeowner?

50:59.139 --> 51:01.475
Value shot up by 200 million won!

51:05.437 --> 51:07.272
Don't beat a dead horse.

51:08.023 --> 51:09.691
I just want to die!

51:13.111 --> 51:14.988
I rent a studio apartment too.

51:15.781 --> 51:17.783
So people like us
aren't allowed to get married?

51:18.658 --> 51:21.536
A studio becomes two bedrooms,
then three bedrooms.

51:22.746 --> 51:24.581
Yeah, Eun-ju's right.

51:24.664 --> 51:27.125
I started with a studio,
then moved up to three bedrooms.

51:27.209 --> 51:29.169
But it took you 11 years!

51:30.754 --> 51:32.839
And look at your three-bedroom apartment…

51:45.977 --> 51:46.978
Seung-tae. Hey.

51:47.062 --> 51:48.271
Seung-tae.

51:48.772 --> 51:50.774
-What's up?
-I gotta find something.

51:50.857 --> 51:53.485
Hurry out. Rocks are falling.

51:53.568 --> 51:54.653
I'll be right out.

52:20.512 --> 52:23.223
They really want us to die, huh?

52:23.723 --> 52:25.267
What the hell…

52:27.144 --> 52:30.939
EMERGENCY EVACUATION BUS

53:15.609 --> 53:18.528
Why is the rescue taking so long?
Feels like it's been a month.

53:18.612 --> 53:20.363
It hasn't even been a day.

53:22.115 --> 53:23.867
They must know we're alive, right?

53:23.950 --> 53:25.452
They have to.

53:25.952 --> 53:28.371
Let's wait patiently.

53:29.539 --> 53:30.874
This is expired. Toss it.

53:33.001 --> 53:35.545
Who cares about that at a time like this?

53:35.629 --> 53:36.838
You're really sensitive.

53:37.672 --> 53:39.633
I get constipated
if I eat stuff like that.

53:42.344 --> 53:45.972
At 10:50 a.m.
in the Jangsu District today,

53:46.056 --> 53:48.975
a giant sinkhole emerged.

53:49.059 --> 53:53.313
An entire low-rise apartment
has sunk completely in it.

53:53.396 --> 53:58.109
The sinkhole was likely created
when the ground gave way

53:58.193 --> 54:01.404
and consumed a newly built
Chungwoon villa.

54:01.488 --> 54:04.866
We are currently investigating
the scope of damages.

54:04.950 --> 54:08.203
Thirty-two people with minor injuries

54:08.286 --> 54:11.539
and seven people with serious injuries

54:11.623 --> 54:13.750
have been transferred to 12 hospitals…

54:13.833 --> 54:20.799
JANGSU HOSPITAL MEDICAL SUPPORT

54:25.345 --> 54:27.847
They're probably starving down there.

54:33.770 --> 54:34.938
What's this?

54:59.087 --> 55:01.131
Mud-roasted chicken.

55:04.426 --> 55:06.594
Let's all eat.

55:07.304 --> 55:08.471
Hold on.

55:13.184 --> 55:15.478
Here. Eat.

55:18.189 --> 55:19.190
Hey, 501.

55:20.608 --> 55:21.443
eat this.

55:27.240 --> 55:28.283
Let's eat.

55:38.168 --> 55:39.836
That's the rocking chair you bought?

55:42.047 --> 55:42.922
Yeah.

55:44.257 --> 55:46.801
I wanted a good chair
when I bought a home.

55:48.636 --> 55:51.931
Not something
that got banged up when moving.

55:52.515 --> 55:55.226
Something good
that I could pass on to my son.

55:55.852 --> 55:57.645
You can buy another one when we get out.

55:58.229 --> 55:59.689
I don't have a home now.

56:01.858 --> 56:03.985
The rain stopped.

56:04.986 --> 56:06.613
It finally stopped.

56:11.242 --> 56:13.370
Don't worry.

56:13.453 --> 56:16.206
The rescue team will come get us soon.

56:20.460 --> 56:22.295
Seung-hyeon, you're single, right?

56:23.296 --> 56:25.298
-Yes.
-Don't get married.

56:27.133 --> 56:28.468
I won't be able to.

56:29.302 --> 56:31.638
No home, no future.

56:32.680 --> 56:35.308
I was so jealous
when Mr. Park said he bought a home.

56:36.267 --> 56:39.562
-You bought it? You bought your home?
-Yes.

56:40.146 --> 56:42.649
-How much?
-Three hundred and ninety million won.

56:44.567 --> 56:45.944
It went up already?

56:48.488 --> 56:49.989
How much did you pay?

56:50.990 --> 56:53.785
I'm leasing. 850,000 won
with 30 million won deposit.

56:55.537 --> 56:57.580
So cold.

56:57.664 --> 57:00.417
We've got a lot to burn.

57:00.500 --> 57:04.045
Toss in some more wood.
There's a lot of firewood.

57:04.129 --> 57:05.296
What are these?

57:05.380 --> 57:07.799
Let's chop these up and burn them.

57:07.882 --> 57:08.800
Hurry.

57:09.801 --> 57:11.219
Geez, man.

57:12.637 --> 57:14.347
This thing's useless.

57:16.433 --> 57:18.268
It's so damn sturdy.

58:04.522 --> 58:07.609
-What's wrong?
-I think we lost connection with it.

58:09.235 --> 58:10.653
That's bad.

58:27.545 --> 58:29.088
It's 911.

58:29.172 --> 58:31.883
Dad! 911 is here!

58:31.966 --> 58:35.136
Dad, 911 is here!

58:35.220 --> 58:36.387
-What?
-911!

58:37.889 --> 58:39.933
Hey! 911's here!

58:40.016 --> 58:43.269
-Come on out! 911!
-911 is here!

58:43.353 --> 58:45.647
Rescue's here!

58:46.272 --> 58:48.942
Where? Where's 911?

58:49.025 --> 58:50.735
-Over here.
-What?

58:50.818 --> 58:52.862
Where?

58:53.488 --> 58:54.489
This is 911?

58:54.572 --> 58:57.033
-It says 911 on it!
-We're saved!

58:57.116 --> 58:58.117
We're saved!

58:58.201 --> 58:59.369
It fell down the sinkhole.

58:59.452 --> 59:01.913
GPS signal is low here,
so they lost control.

59:03.122 --> 59:06.209
The hole is so wide, why can't they?

59:06.292 --> 59:08.586
Just like how you lose the GPS
in tunnels and mountains.

59:08.670 --> 59:11.339
We're at least 250 meters under,
so there's no signal.

59:11.422 --> 59:12.882
Is the camera working?

59:12.966 --> 59:14.759
Citizens of Korea, please help us!

59:14.842 --> 59:18.304
There are five survivors!
I'm Kim Seung-hyeon, 33!

59:18.388 --> 59:19.973
I don't live here.

59:20.056 --> 59:22.100
-Is this yours?
-Mind your own business.

59:22.183 --> 59:23.142
Why is there money…

59:30.900 --> 59:32.402
Hold on! Come this way!

59:35.113 --> 59:36.823
Hold on to this.

59:44.080 --> 59:45.623
Get over here.

59:58.177 --> 59:59.762
Seung-hyeon!

1:00:07.854 --> 1:00:09.105
Mr. Kim!

1:00:10.898 --> 1:00:13.610
-Help me.
-Mr. Kim!

1:00:21.868 --> 1:00:23.953
Don't go. Please.

1:00:43.264 --> 1:00:45.099
Eun-ju, don't dodge rocks!

1:01:00.698 --> 1:01:01.783
Catch this!

1:01:15.963 --> 1:01:17.674
Mr. Park, pull the rope!

1:01:21.010 --> 1:01:22.220
Sir!

1:01:22.303 --> 1:01:23.846
Help me!

1:01:36.943 --> 1:01:38.403
Pull the rope!

1:01:38.486 --> 1:01:40.613
Help me! Please!

1:01:48.746 --> 1:01:52.917
Seung-hyeon, I'm coming! Hang in there!

1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:55.753
I'm hanging! Hanging by a thread.

1:01:56.337 --> 1:01:57.338
Pull!

1:01:59.674 --> 1:02:02.969
I'm coming up! Do it together!

1:02:03.052 --> 1:02:04.137
Pull.

1:02:12.145 --> 1:02:14.021
I'm coming up. Good!

1:02:19.110 --> 1:02:21.154
Please help! Help!

1:03:17.835 --> 1:03:18.920
It hurts!

1:03:19.545 --> 1:03:21.130
My arm!

1:03:22.381 --> 1:03:23.925
Eun-ju, hold on tight.

1:03:32.475 --> 1:03:33.851
-Man-su!
-Man-su!

1:03:40.858 --> 1:03:42.068
Dad!

1:03:42.151 --> 1:03:44.904
-I'm fine.
-Dad!

1:03:45.613 --> 1:03:49.325
Dad, don't move!
You'll sink more if you move!

1:03:49.408 --> 1:03:51.911
-Dad.
-It's okay. I'm fine…

1:03:53.704 --> 1:03:55.748
-Dad!
-No!

1:03:55.832 --> 1:03:57.041
Dad.

1:04:00.920 --> 1:04:02.004
Dad!

1:04:18.646 --> 1:04:20.314
Seung-tae!

1:04:24.360 --> 1:04:25.194
Dad!

1:04:30.741 --> 1:04:31.701
Seung-tae.

1:04:32.201 --> 1:04:34.912
Head. Pull your head up.

1:04:38.249 --> 1:04:40.126
Seung-tae, my son.

1:04:40.793 --> 1:04:43.296
I'm sorry, Son. I'm so sorry.

1:04:46.757 --> 1:04:49.051
Dad!

1:04:51.178 --> 1:04:53.306
-Dad.
-Seung-tae.

1:05:00.271 --> 1:05:02.815
Dad! No!

1:05:18.414 --> 1:05:19.665
-Man-su!
-Man-su!

1:05:21.083 --> 1:05:23.085
-Seung-tae!
-Where are you?

1:05:29.425 --> 1:05:30.885
Man-su, breathe.

1:05:32.929 --> 1:05:33.971
Man-su. Wake up.

1:05:36.599 --> 1:05:37.850
Are you okay?

1:05:41.604 --> 1:05:42.480
Snap out of it!

1:05:47.902 --> 1:05:48.945
Seung-tae.

1:05:49.028 --> 1:05:50.696
-Seung-tae. How is he?
-Seung-tae.

1:05:50.780 --> 1:05:51.864
He's awake!

1:05:52.365 --> 1:05:54.867
-Your son's okay. Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

1:05:54.951 --> 1:05:56.535
Seung-tae…

1:05:56.619 --> 1:05:57.703
He's all right.

1:05:57.787 --> 1:05:58.704
Are you okay?

1:06:13.386 --> 1:06:16.347
Wires are supporting the building,
but it may not hold long.

1:06:19.642 --> 1:06:20.518
Isn't that ours?

1:06:23.562 --> 1:06:24.814
It returned home!

1:06:38.285 --> 1:06:41.789
They work with my husband, Hong and Kim.

1:06:50.131 --> 1:06:51.632
I don't see my son, Seong-hun.

1:06:54.093 --> 1:06:55.511
That's the end of the clip.

1:06:57.388 --> 1:06:58.472
What about Seong-hun?

1:06:59.181 --> 1:07:02.018
I'm sorry. That's all that was recorded.

1:07:02.768 --> 1:07:06.689
Seong-hun.

1:07:07.773 --> 1:07:08.941
Sir.

1:07:09.025 --> 1:07:14.071
I don't think my husband
and my son are together.

1:07:15.489 --> 1:07:16.949
Please help.

1:07:19.577 --> 1:07:22.580
You said your son has
your cell phone, right?

1:07:23.372 --> 1:07:24.373
Yes.

1:07:27.209 --> 1:07:28.669
What is life?

1:07:30.838 --> 1:07:32.548
When I was running a restaurant…

1:07:34.633 --> 1:07:39.096
I never cooked my son a proper meal.

1:07:45.936 --> 1:07:47.438
Why didn't I?

1:07:52.485 --> 1:07:54.528
When Seong-hun comes up,

1:07:56.197 --> 1:07:58.699
I'm gonna get rid of the restaurant…

1:08:00.701 --> 1:08:03.537
and stay with him forever.

1:08:05.998 --> 1:08:07.875
That's what I'm gonna do.

1:08:25.142 --> 1:08:27.436
We tracked your cell phone's location.

1:08:29.063 --> 1:08:32.733
Its last known location was…

1:08:35.528 --> 1:08:38.739
inside the building.

1:08:46.497 --> 1:08:47.331
Oh, no.

1:08:51.669 --> 1:08:52.753
It can't be.

1:08:57.091 --> 1:08:58.300
There's one good thing

1:09:00.302 --> 1:09:02.805
about a home with a hole.

1:09:04.056 --> 1:09:05.182
What?

1:09:06.350 --> 1:09:08.936
I get to see my son sleep for once.

1:09:12.773 --> 1:09:16.193
Thank you, 501.

1:09:18.779 --> 1:09:21.073
I'm gonna pay you back.

1:09:21.657 --> 1:09:24.702
We have to get out of here
before we do anything.

1:09:25.411 --> 1:09:29.415
911 sent a drone. What does that mean?

1:09:29.498 --> 1:09:31.667
They know we're here now.

1:09:33.169 --> 1:09:35.713
I hope all the other residents are okay.

1:09:36.297 --> 1:09:40.050
Don't worry.
I banged on all the doors in the morning.

1:09:40.134 --> 1:09:44.013
No one was home at all.
Maybe because there was no running water.

1:09:44.096 --> 1:09:44.930
Really?

1:09:46.807 --> 1:09:48.392
That's a relief.

1:09:49.602 --> 1:09:51.729
I was really worried.

1:10:03.032 --> 1:10:04.491
Is that your mother?

1:10:13.751 --> 1:10:17.004
Do you have any difficulties
working at the office?

1:10:17.087 --> 1:10:18.714
Tell me if you have any.

1:10:18.797 --> 1:10:19.673
Difficulties?

1:10:24.094 --> 1:10:28.098
You know those holiday gifts
our office sends out?

1:10:28.182 --> 1:10:30.309
I'd like to send one to my parents.

1:10:31.143 --> 1:10:32.895
I've never sent one before.

1:10:36.482 --> 1:10:38.525
I don't think they do that for interns.

1:10:49.578 --> 1:10:51.580
My phone's at 3%.

1:10:51.664 --> 1:10:55.000
Should we listen to music
or take a selfie?

1:10:55.668 --> 1:10:56.502
Selfie.

1:11:19.858 --> 1:11:25.489
This just in.
Survivors have been found in the sinkhole.

1:11:25.572 --> 1:11:27.825
The disaster response team

1:11:27.908 --> 1:11:32.288
is working towards rescuing them.

1:11:32.371 --> 1:11:35.874
But with additional cave-ins
and heavy rainfall tonight,

1:11:35.958 --> 1:11:39.545
they're facing an uphill battle.

1:11:39.628 --> 1:11:43.382
There are survivors
currently in the sinkhole.

1:11:43.465 --> 1:11:46.802
If the adjacent building sinks too,
it'll be disastrous.

1:11:46.885 --> 1:11:49.096
Even so,

1:11:49.179 --> 1:11:52.474
who'd agree to blow up
a perfectly good building?

1:11:52.558 --> 1:11:55.686
As I mentioned before,
we're not blowing it up.

1:11:55.769 --> 1:11:58.939
We would collapse the pillars

1:11:59.023 --> 1:12:01.734
and neutralize the weight
away from the sinkhole.

1:12:01.817 --> 1:12:05.696
If we don't do that,
your building too will fall in.

1:12:05.779 --> 1:12:10.784
Will you only rescue them?
We have a right to live too. Am I right?

1:12:10.868 --> 1:12:12.286
-Of course.
-My gosh.

1:12:12.369 --> 1:12:16.415
Until our homes are secured,
we can't agree to this, right?

1:12:16.498 --> 1:12:20.169
Sure. I can't agree to that.

1:12:27.926 --> 1:12:29.595
Let me say something.

1:12:32.056 --> 1:12:34.308
There was a man on the roof.

1:12:34.391 --> 1:12:38.270
He kept looking at me as he went down.

1:12:38.354 --> 1:12:42.107
We locked eyes, and I felt so bad for him.

1:12:42.900 --> 1:12:46.862
It took me 20 years to buy my home.

1:12:48.906 --> 1:12:52.493
But if I don't agree to this,

1:12:53.452 --> 1:12:55.329
I may go to hell.

1:12:56.538 --> 1:12:58.165
I agree to your plan.

1:13:08.675 --> 1:13:10.552
ETA on the satellite phone
and survival kits?

1:13:10.636 --> 1:13:12.805
We're attaching parachutes.
It'll take some time.

1:13:12.888 --> 1:13:15.140
The rain will start soon! Get on it now!

1:13:15.224 --> 1:13:16.225
Right away, sir.

1:13:24.358 --> 1:13:25.526
Deploy.

1:13:49.007 --> 1:13:50.759
Take these. They're yours.

1:13:51.510 --> 1:13:55.848
You saved up by not going on trips
or buying books.

1:13:56.890 --> 1:13:57.766
Take them.

1:14:02.146 --> 1:14:05.649
Seung-tae, can I ask you something?

1:14:06.150 --> 1:14:07.192
Sure.

1:14:07.276 --> 1:14:09.069
Why did you save all that?

1:14:10.529 --> 1:14:12.531
My dream was to save up 100 million won.

1:14:13.240 --> 1:14:15.659
That was your dream? 100 million won?

1:14:15.742 --> 1:14:17.995
-Yeah.
-And after that?

1:14:19.830 --> 1:14:20.664
I don't know.

1:14:22.291 --> 1:14:25.586
You're so lame.

1:14:27.212 --> 1:14:30.591
Seung-tae, look at that.

1:14:32.217 --> 1:14:36.346
Dreams are like stars.

1:14:36.430 --> 1:14:38.932
They're supposed to be far away.

1:14:39.933 --> 1:14:43.520
Dad, the star's getting closer.

1:14:44.438 --> 1:14:47.357
Why would a star get closer?
Are you drunk?

1:14:48.692 --> 1:14:51.612
What's that? Something fell.

1:14:53.071 --> 1:14:55.491
We're saved.

1:14:56.450 --> 1:14:58.702
This means we will be rescued soon.

1:14:58.785 --> 1:15:01.246
Thank you.

1:15:20.140 --> 1:15:22.559
This water is so sweet.

1:15:22.643 --> 1:15:24.353
-What's that?
-Satellite phone.

1:15:24.937 --> 1:15:26.355
I got a signal.

1:15:27.189 --> 1:15:28.482
I can make calls?

1:15:35.155 --> 1:15:36.990
Mom!

1:15:37.074 --> 1:15:40.202
Mom…

1:15:40.285 --> 1:15:43.330
It's not her. Her number is…

1:15:44.039 --> 1:15:45.916
-It wasn't your mom?
-It was a man.

1:15:46.750 --> 1:15:48.961
Here. Call home.

1:15:51.129 --> 1:15:52.005
It's okay.

1:15:52.089 --> 1:15:56.009
If I call now,
they'll just be more worried.

1:15:57.386 --> 1:15:59.596
I'll return to the surface
and see my mom.

1:16:11.024 --> 1:16:11.900
Hyo-jeong.

1:16:13.026 --> 1:16:16.697
Yeah, I'm with Mr. Park, and Eun-ju.
We're all good.

1:16:16.780 --> 1:16:18.156
Thank you for thinking of us.

1:16:18.240 --> 1:16:20.284
I called to tell you something.

1:16:23.287 --> 1:16:25.163
You know that Thanksgiving gift list?

1:16:26.665 --> 1:16:28.250
Put Eun-ju on the list.

1:16:30.711 --> 1:16:32.838
Barbecue set, maybe? Korean beef.

1:16:32.921 --> 1:16:35.507
Don't forget to put
the company name on it. Bye.

1:16:42.389 --> 1:16:45.559
Here. Call your wife.

1:16:49.062 --> 1:16:50.147
What the…

1:16:50.230 --> 1:16:52.608
-Answer.
-Hello?

1:16:52.691 --> 1:16:54.943
This is the rescue team. Can you hear me?

1:16:56.320 --> 1:16:59.197
Thank you! I'm Park Dong-won.

1:17:00.115 --> 1:17:01.783
There are five survivors.

1:17:01.867 --> 1:17:03.493
Is everyone okay? Any injuries?

1:17:03.577 --> 1:17:06.288
Yes, everyone's okay.

1:17:06.913 --> 1:17:08.040
Let me go inside.

1:17:08.957 --> 1:17:11.126
-I have to save my boy.
-Mr. Park!

1:17:11.209 --> 1:17:13.295
We'll be there in an hour. No, 30 minutes.

1:17:13.378 --> 1:17:14.671
Is Su-chan down there?

1:17:17.341 --> 1:17:18.592
Yeong-yi?

1:17:18.675 --> 1:17:21.845
What do you mean?
Didn't he go shopping with you?

1:17:21.928 --> 1:17:24.931
He took my cell phone.

1:17:25.015 --> 1:17:27.059
His last known location
was inside the building.

1:17:27.559 --> 1:17:30.020
Honey, he's down there.

1:17:31.688 --> 1:17:34.608
Didn't you see my boy
taking the elevator outside?

1:17:34.691 --> 1:17:37.027
Yeah. Why?

1:17:37.653 --> 1:17:40.739
He's missing. He never went to my wife.

1:17:41.239 --> 1:17:45.285
What do you mean? I really saw him.

1:17:45.369 --> 1:17:46.703
Mr. Park!

1:17:46.787 --> 1:17:49.581
We'll rescue the child.
You must stay in place.

1:17:58.548 --> 1:18:00.133
Mom…

1:18:28.829 --> 1:18:29.705
Mr. Park…

1:18:32.165 --> 1:18:33.542
Be careful.

1:18:39.548 --> 1:18:40.882
Go slow.

1:18:40.966 --> 1:18:43.593
Hold on tight! Easy. Be careful!

1:18:51.810 --> 1:18:53.979
Are you okay?

1:18:55.731 --> 1:18:56.773
Yes.

1:18:57.315 --> 1:19:01.653
There should be a hatch
to get inside. Open it.

1:19:05.198 --> 1:19:07.284
-Do you see it?
-Yes.

1:19:31.266 --> 1:19:32.100
Descend.

1:19:49.701 --> 1:19:51.495
It's falling over! Stop!

1:19:51.578 --> 1:19:52.788
Pull him up!

1:20:17.562 --> 1:20:19.231
-Seung-tae, get inside.
-And you?

1:20:19.314 --> 1:20:21.399
I have to hold on to this.

1:20:21.483 --> 1:20:23.568
-Go inside with him.
-Seung-tae.

1:20:34.287 --> 1:20:35.622
No!

1:20:48.218 --> 1:20:50.262
-Su-chan!
-Dad!

1:20:52.138 --> 1:20:53.431
Dad!

1:21:12.450 --> 1:21:14.327
Wait for me.

1:21:19.374 --> 1:21:22.377
Seong-hun. Wait.

1:21:22.460 --> 1:21:25.005
Wait for me!

1:21:25.088 --> 1:21:28.884
Seong-hun!

1:21:37.517 --> 1:21:38.685
Where's Mr. Park?

1:21:39.728 --> 1:21:40.562
Dad…

1:21:42.564 --> 1:21:46.484
I couldn't hang on to the rope.

1:21:49.362 --> 1:21:50.196
Oh, no.

1:21:57.078 --> 1:21:57.954
Su-chan.

1:22:27.150 --> 1:22:28.401
Su-chan!

1:22:30.236 --> 1:22:31.780
Su-chan!

1:22:37.035 --> 1:22:38.620
Su-chan!

1:22:39.746 --> 1:22:41.122
Su-chan.

1:22:42.832 --> 1:22:43.750
Su-chan.

1:22:46.169 --> 1:22:47.295
Su-chan.

1:22:55.011 --> 1:22:56.763
Su-chan, I'm here!

1:22:56.846 --> 1:22:59.557
Dad!

1:22:59.641 --> 1:23:00.767
Su-chan!

1:23:03.144 --> 1:23:04.145
Su-chan!

1:23:12.404 --> 1:23:13.238
Su-chan!

1:23:14.280 --> 1:23:16.241
Dad!

1:23:16.324 --> 1:23:17.617
I'll get you out.

1:23:24.332 --> 1:23:26.209
Su-chan.

1:23:26.292 --> 1:23:28.837
Dad.

1:23:39.889 --> 1:23:43.309
Su-chan. Are you all right?

1:23:44.352 --> 1:23:45.979
Where's Mom?

1:23:46.646 --> 1:23:47.480
Mom…

1:23:48.732 --> 1:23:52.193
Mom's waiting for you at home.

1:23:56.865 --> 1:23:58.658
Su-chan, let's go home.

1:23:59.200 --> 1:24:00.285
Let's go home.

1:24:02.787 --> 1:24:04.664
Where's Seong-hun?

1:24:06.416 --> 1:24:07.417
Seong-hun?

1:24:16.760 --> 1:24:18.595
Grandma.

1:24:35.779 --> 1:24:38.823
Thank you. Are you okay, ma'am?

1:24:41.242 --> 1:24:42.911
The boy's hurt.

1:24:44.204 --> 1:24:45.246
Pardon?

1:26:17.046 --> 1:26:18.047
Ma'am.

1:27:00.715 --> 1:27:03.468
You have to come with us.

1:27:08.223 --> 1:27:10.016
Go on.

1:27:13.686 --> 1:27:15.688
Please come with us.

1:27:19.651 --> 1:27:20.485
Ma'am…

1:27:26.991 --> 1:27:28.326
What's the situation?

1:27:28.409 --> 1:27:30.703
Rain is filling up all over the building.

1:27:37.293 --> 1:27:38.378
Mr. Park…

1:28:33.099 --> 1:28:35.226
I'm sorry, Seong-hun.

1:28:37.312 --> 1:28:38.313
I'm sorry.

1:28:41.774 --> 1:28:44.777
I wanted to take you back to your mom.

1:28:56.831 --> 1:28:59.542
You must survive.

1:29:00.668 --> 1:29:02.211
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

1:29:09.093 --> 1:29:10.970
Seong-hun…

1:29:29.947 --> 1:29:31.407
Hang in there.

1:30:15.868 --> 1:30:17.578
Sweetie, hold on tight.

1:30:31.759 --> 1:30:32.844
Are you okay?

1:30:32.927 --> 1:30:34.262
Dad.

1:30:35.054 --> 1:30:36.472
Hold on tight.

1:30:58.870 --> 1:31:00.037
What was that?

1:31:57.386 --> 1:31:58.304
Man-su!

1:31:59.680 --> 1:32:00.765
Mr. Park?

1:32:12.109 --> 1:32:14.654
Seung-hyeon! Hey!

1:32:16.113 --> 1:32:16.948
Man-su!

1:32:18.366 --> 1:32:19.742
Seung-hyeon!

1:32:24.747 --> 1:32:25.957
501…

1:32:27.416 --> 1:32:28.709
501!

1:32:31.504 --> 1:32:32.588
Man-su!

1:32:33.381 --> 1:32:35.049
Seung-hyeon!

1:32:42.515 --> 1:32:46.435
-Man-su!
-Where is he? This way.

1:32:48.479 --> 1:32:49.981
Seung-hyeon!

1:33:02.577 --> 1:33:03.953
Man-su!

1:33:04.036 --> 1:33:05.788
Over there.

1:33:06.914 --> 1:33:08.833
Mr. Park! Sir!

1:33:09.542 --> 1:33:11.502
-What do we do?
-Mr. Park!

1:33:12.336 --> 1:33:13.963
-Hold on.
-Are you okay?

1:33:14.046 --> 1:33:15.590
Seung-hyeon!

1:33:15.673 --> 1:33:16.841
Su-chan.

1:33:16.924 --> 1:33:19.343
-Are you okay?
-Su-chan. Pass us the boy.

1:33:20.595 --> 1:33:21.429
Come here.

1:33:23.347 --> 1:33:24.765
Watch his head.

1:33:25.349 --> 1:33:26.851
-Su-chan!
-Oh my goodness.

1:33:30.479 --> 1:33:32.815
Su-chan, are you okay?

1:33:32.898 --> 1:33:36.319
-Good evening…
-Hey.

1:33:36.402 --> 1:33:38.070
Please help!

1:33:40.573 --> 1:33:42.033
Pull.

1:33:44.619 --> 1:33:46.329
You are alive!

1:33:46.412 --> 1:33:47.872
Mr. Park!

1:33:47.955 --> 1:33:52.043
You are alive! Thank God.

1:33:54.211 --> 1:33:56.130
Hurry. Water's filling up.

1:34:26.535 --> 1:34:29.330
What is that? Why is that here?

1:34:31.290 --> 1:34:33.834
Will it fall right on top of us?

1:34:33.918 --> 1:34:35.378
It's barely hanging on.

1:34:40.341 --> 1:34:42.259
Water will fill up soon.

1:34:42.343 --> 1:34:44.553
What to do…

1:34:44.637 --> 1:34:46.347
What do we do?

1:34:55.106 --> 1:34:58.651
This is it! We have to use this!

1:34:58.734 --> 1:35:03.280
Find anything that will float.

1:35:03.364 --> 1:35:04.490
Anything that floats.

1:35:17.545 --> 1:35:19.380
Seung-tae. Hey!

1:35:25.678 --> 1:35:28.180
We're gonna live. We'll live!

1:36:12.099 --> 1:36:13.434
That's on a whole other level!

1:36:14.226 --> 1:36:16.896
Everyone, gather around!

1:36:19.064 --> 1:36:21.358
This is it. The submarine.

1:36:22.276 --> 1:36:24.570
The Beatles, "Yellow Submarine."

1:36:27.823 --> 1:36:30.034
Dad. Where's the cap?

1:36:31.619 --> 1:36:32.787
There's no cap?

1:36:32.870 --> 1:36:33.704
Cap…

1:36:36.290 --> 1:36:38.751
-There!
-Is that it?

1:36:43.255 --> 1:36:44.673
Give me that.

1:36:45.674 --> 1:36:47.259
Lift it. One, two, three!

1:36:48.969 --> 1:36:50.513
-It fits.
-This is it.

1:36:50.596 --> 1:36:51.972
It fits.

1:36:53.557 --> 1:36:55.851
-Put Su-chan inside.
-Okay.

1:36:55.935 --> 1:36:56.769
Get him inside.

1:36:57.645 --> 1:36:58.771
One, two!

1:37:00.523 --> 1:37:01.816
Su-chan, come here.

1:37:02.733 --> 1:37:04.318
-Seung-hyeon.
-Okay.

1:37:09.532 --> 1:37:11.283
-Be careful.
-Dad.

1:37:13.577 --> 1:37:15.162
Get in.

1:37:15.788 --> 1:37:17.081
Seung-tae.

1:37:27.925 --> 1:37:29.051
Get in.

1:37:31.011 --> 1:37:31.971
Careful.

1:37:33.222 --> 1:37:34.723
Hey, 501, get in.

1:37:42.648 --> 1:37:45.025
-Man-su, hop in.
-Dad, get in.

1:37:45.109 --> 1:37:47.403
Hey, I'll catch up soon.

1:37:48.404 --> 1:37:49.405
What?

1:37:49.488 --> 1:37:51.323
If everyone gets in,
who will put this cap on?

1:37:54.368 --> 1:37:56.745
Dad! No!

1:37:56.829 --> 1:37:58.622
-Man-su!
-Sir!

1:37:58.706 --> 1:38:00.958
Dad!

1:38:01.542 --> 1:38:03.836
No! Dad!

1:38:03.919 --> 1:38:07.631
Seung-tae, I'll join you.

1:38:07.715 --> 1:38:10.342
Dad!

1:38:10.426 --> 1:38:12.303
-Sir!
-Dad!

1:38:12.386 --> 1:38:13.596
-Man-su!
-Dad!

1:38:13.679 --> 1:38:15.848
-Sir!
-Sir…

1:38:34.074 --> 1:38:37.161
-No! Man-su!
-Dad!

1:38:37.244 --> 1:38:39.955
-Man-su!
-Sir!

1:38:44.376 --> 1:38:46.420
Dad!

1:38:50.841 --> 1:38:51.842
Dad!

1:38:56.180 --> 1:38:58.182
No! Open it!

1:38:58.682 --> 1:39:00.851
Dad! Open the cap!

1:39:52.194 --> 1:39:53.195
Seung-tae, you okay?

1:40:02.997 --> 1:40:04.498
I think we're stuck on something.

1:40:13.090 --> 1:40:14.174
We need to free it!

1:40:22.641 --> 1:40:24.601
-Jump!
-Jump!

1:40:29.314 --> 1:40:30.774
One, two, three!

1:40:32.026 --> 1:40:33.610
One, two, three!

1:40:34.236 --> 1:40:35.988
One, two, three!

1:40:37.823 --> 1:40:39.241
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

1:40:47.541 --> 1:40:48.542
-We did it!
-Okay!

1:40:58.927 --> 1:41:00.596
Eun-ju, push!

1:41:03.307 --> 1:41:06.143
Push! Harder!

1:41:37.800 --> 1:41:39.718
We're free!

1:42:00.280 --> 1:42:02.783
Plug it!

1:43:19.610 --> 1:43:20.694
What the hell happened?

1:43:25.991 --> 1:43:27.075
Water is leaking in!

1:43:37.211 --> 1:43:38.212
Help!

1:43:39.880 --> 1:43:41.715
-Help us!
-Help!

1:43:41.798 --> 1:43:43.926
-Help!
-Help! Please!

1:43:45.052 --> 1:43:46.053
Help!

1:44:01.526 --> 1:44:02.778
Over here!

1:44:08.450 --> 1:44:11.203
Please! Help!

1:44:12.955 --> 1:44:14.498
Help!

1:44:15.040 --> 1:44:17.042
-Help us!
-Help!

1:44:33.767 --> 1:44:35.018
Look. What's that?

1:44:37.187 --> 1:44:38.897
Chief, I see someone.

1:44:42.859 --> 1:44:44.945
They're alive. They're alive!

1:45:02.671 --> 1:45:04.089
-Dad!
-Man-su!

1:45:04.631 --> 1:45:05.924
Is everyone okay?

1:45:06.008 --> 1:45:07.259
Man-su!

1:45:08.385 --> 1:45:11.054
-Good evening…
-Hey, there.

1:45:11.138 --> 1:45:13.223
Dad!

1:45:13.307 --> 1:45:17.477
Seung-tae, we're saved!

1:47:01.415 --> 1:47:08.380
EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM

1:47:21.518 --> 1:47:23.353
Where the heck is it?

1:47:23.937 --> 1:47:26.857
-Can't you call him?
-He said it's here with a Han River view.

1:47:26.940 --> 1:47:28.817
We are literally at the Han River.

1:47:28.900 --> 1:47:30.569
This isn't a spot for a home.

1:47:30.652 --> 1:47:33.822
No, it's definitely not a spot for a home.

1:47:33.905 --> 1:47:34.865
Mr. Park!

1:47:37.075 --> 1:47:39.619
Seung-hyeon! Look!

1:47:39.703 --> 1:47:41.538
They only bought toilet paper?

1:47:45.792 --> 1:47:46.960
This is your home?

1:47:48.086 --> 1:47:50.297
-This is a home?
-It sure is.

1:47:51.590 --> 1:47:54.676
Han River view today,
Mount Namsan view tomorrow.

1:47:54.759 --> 1:47:57.929
The beach on the weekend.
A newlywed home that can go anywhere.

1:47:58.013 --> 1:48:00.682
We've got everything.
We have a bed, a fridge and a stove too.

1:48:00.765 --> 1:48:02.100
It really has everything.

1:48:02.184 --> 1:48:05.020
Very nice.

1:48:05.687 --> 1:48:09.941
But even so, a home should be stationary

1:48:10.025 --> 1:48:14.237
and a place you stay for a decade or two.

1:48:14.321 --> 1:48:15.530
Sure thing.

1:48:15.614 --> 1:48:17.449
Don't be happy in ten years.

1:48:17.532 --> 1:48:20.702
-Be happy today.
-Be happy today.

1:48:20.785 --> 1:48:23.288
-Our love is forever!
-Our love is forever!

1:48:23.371 --> 1:48:25.665
-That's great.
-This is our philosophy.

1:48:25.749 --> 1:48:28.502
We're using our savings
to travel to the North Pole.

1:48:28.585 --> 1:48:31.338
There's barely any food to drink with.

1:48:31.421 --> 1:48:33.673
They deliver here too.
Do you want to get take out?

1:48:33.757 --> 1:48:35.300
Take out?

1:48:44.309 --> 1:48:45.727
Mud-roasted chicken.

1:48:49.231 --> 1:48:50.357
Oh, my God!

1:48:50.440 --> 1:48:51.775
Watch.

1:49:05.664 --> 1:49:07.290
Don't be scared, you chickens!

1:49:19.886 --> 1:49:20.971
Come over here.

1:49:33.567 --> 1:49:35.777
I got scared for nothing.

1:49:38.947 --> 1:49:40.949
Look how great my home is.

1:49:41.032 --> 1:49:42.909
This is really nice.

1:49:42.993 --> 1:49:45.787
-I wish we could live here too.
-Come on.

1:49:49.291 --> 1:49:50.792
This is nice.

1:49:51.960 --> 1:49:52.919
This is great!

1:53:57.497 --> 1:54:02.502
