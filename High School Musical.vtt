You're watching from StreamFlex app.

00:00:29.697 --> 00:00:31.241
Happy New Year's, ladies.

00:00:31.324 --> 00:00:34.202
Gabby, it's New Year's Eve.
Enough reading.

00:00:34.285 --> 00:00:36.079
But, Mom, I'm almost done.

00:00:36.162 --> 00:00:39.207
The teen party? I've laid out
your best clothes. Come get ready.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.669
Can I have my book back?

00:00:42.752 --> 00:00:45.463
- Thank you.
- Come on.

00:00:46.714 --> 00:00:50.510
Keep working left, Troy. Got a guard in the
championship game we're expecting. You'll torch him!

00:00:50.593 --> 00:00:51.886
- By going left?
- Yeah.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.180
- He looks middle, you take it downtown.
- OK, like this?

00:00:57.725 --> 00:00:59.644
- That's it, man. Sweet.
- OK, that's it. That's money.

00:00:59.727 --> 00:01:01.771
- Let's see that in the game. - Boys?
- You'll see that in the game.

00:01:01.854 --> 00:01:07.402
- Don't worry about me. - Did we really
fly all this way to play more basketball?

00:01:07.485 --> 00:01:08.611
Yeah.

00:01:08.695 --> 00:01:12.991
It's the last night of vacation.
The party, remember?

00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:16.077
Right, the party.
The party. New Year's Eve.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.414
Troy, they have a kids' party downstairs
in the Freestyle club.

00:01:19.497 --> 00:01:22.500
- Kids' party?
- Young adults. Now go, shower up.

00:01:22.917 --> 00:01:25.086
Come on. One more.

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:27.255
- Last one.
- Real quick. Real quick.

00:01:29.257 --> 00:01:31.175
There we go.
That's the way to end it.

00:01:50.403 --> 00:01:52.530
Howdy, ma'am.

00:01:58.578 --> 00:02:03.124
All right! How about that
for a couple of snowboarders?

00:02:03.207 --> 00:02:05.293
Yeah!

00:02:06.753 --> 00:02:09.213
Who's gonna rock the house next?

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.813
- I can't sing. No, you go.
- And you!

00:02:25.897 --> 00:02:27.982
Yeah, come on.

00:02:29.233 --> 00:02:32.820
I don't sing. I can't sing.
No, guys!

00:02:32.904 --> 00:02:37.825
You know what? Someday -
Someday you guys might thank me for this.

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:39.661
Or not.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.757
<i>Living in my own world</i>

00:02:53.925 --> 00:02:56.636
<i>Didn't understand</i>

00:02:58.471 --> 00:03:01.516
<i>That anything can happen</i>

00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:05.269
<i>When you take a chance</i>

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:11.150
<i>I never believed in</i>

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.030
<i>What I couldn't see</i>

00:03:16.531 --> 00:03:20.535
<i>I never opened my heart</i>

00:03:20.618 --> 00:03:24.997
<i>To all the possibilities</i>

00:03:26.457 --> 00:03:30.044
<i>- I know
- That something has changed</i>

00:03:30.128 --> 00:03:32.088
<i>Never felt this way</i>

00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:34.132
<i>And right here tonight</i>

00:03:34.215 --> 00:03:39.053
<i>This could be the start of something new</i>

00:03:39.137 --> 00:03:41.222
<i>It feels so right</i>

00:03:41.305 --> 00:03:44.892
<i>To be here with you</i>

00:03:44.976 --> 00:03:48.146
<i>And now, lookin' in your eyes</i>

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:52.442
<i>- I feel in my heart
- Feel in my heart</i>

00:03:52.525 --> 00:03:55.820
<i>The start of something new</i>

00:03:55.903 --> 00:03:58.656
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.910
<i>Now who'd have ever thought that</i>

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:05.663
<i>We'd both be here tonight</i>

00:04:06.456 --> 00:04:07.665
<i>Yeah</i>

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:12.295
<i>- And the world looks so much brighter
- Brighter, brighter</i>

00:04:12.378 --> 00:04:17.466
<i>- With you by my side
- By my side</i>

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.595
<i>I know that something has changed</i>

00:04:20.678 --> 00:04:22.930
<i>Never felt this way</i>

00:04:23.014 --> 00:04:25.349
<i>- I know it for real
- Real</i>

00:04:25.433 --> 00:04:29.812
<i>This could be the start of something new</i>

00:04:29.896 --> 00:04:34.525

<i>The start of something new</i>

00:04:45.703 --> 00:04:51.292
<i>I never knew that it could happen
till it happened to me</i>

00:04:51.375 --> 00:04:54.253
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

00:04:54.796 --> 00:05:01.636
<i>I didn't know it before
but now it's easy to see</i>

00:05:04.972 --> 00:05:09.227
<i>It's the start of something new</i>

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.606
<i>It feels so right to be here with you</i>

00:05:15.066 --> 00:05:18.319

<i>The start of something new</i>

00:05:56.607 --> 00:05:59.527
- Troy.
- Gabriella.

00:06:02.947 --> 00:06:05.867
But seriously, you have an amazing voice.
You're a singer, right?

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.953
Just church choir is all.
I tried a solo and nearly fainted.

00:06:09.036 --> 00:06:12.081
- Really? Why is that?
- I took one look at all the people staring at me,

00:06:12.164 --> 00:06:15.251
and next thing I knew I was staring
at the ceiling. End of solo career.

00:06:15.334 --> 00:06:17.545
Well, with the way you sang tonight,
that's pretty hard to believe.

00:06:17.628 --> 00:06:21.048
Well, that was the first time I've done
something like that. I mean, it was so cool.

00:06:21.132 --> 00:06:24.385
- I know. Completely.
- You sounded like you've done a lot of singing too.

00:06:24.468 --> 00:06:27.638
Yeah, sure. My shower head
is very impressed with me.

00:06:27.722 --> 00:06:30.892
9, 8, 7,

00:06:30.975 --> 00:06:34.061
6, 5, 4,

00:06:34.145 --> 00:06:36.814
3, 2, 1!

00:06:52.663 --> 00:06:55.917
I guess I'd better go find my mom
and wish her a happy New Year.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.047
Yeah, me too. I mean, not your mom.
My mom. And dad.

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.800
- I'll call you. I'll call you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

00:07:04.884 --> 00:07:07.345
Here, put your number in.

00:07:09.931 --> 00:07:11.307
Here.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.517
- You too.
- OK.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.272
There you go.

00:07:18.356 --> 00:07:23.778
Well, just so you know, singing with you was
the most fun I've had on this entire vacation.

00:07:23.861 --> 00:07:26.697
So, where do you live?

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:39.919
Gabriella.

00:07:42.421 --> 00:07:46.634
<i>Wildcats sing along
Yeah, you really got it goin' on</i>

00:07:46.717 --> 00:07:50.805
<i>Wildcats in the house
Everybody say it now</i>

00:07:50.888 --> 00:07:54.892
<i>Wildcats everywhere
Wave your hands up in the air</i>

00:07:54.976 --> 00:07:57.478
<i>That's the way we do it
Let's get to it</i>

00:07:57.561 --> 00:07:59.146
<i>Time to show the world</i>

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:03.150
<i>Wildcats sing along
Yeah, you really got it goin' on</i>

00:08:03.234 --> 00:08:06.862
<i>Wildcats in the house
Everybody say it now...</i>

00:08:06.946 --> 00:08:10.366
- Troy! How's it going, man?
- Hey, Chad, what's up?

00:08:10.449 --> 00:08:12.702
- Hey, guys, happy New Year.
- Yeah!

00:08:12.785 --> 00:08:15.371
- It's gonna be a happy Wildcat New Year, man...
- Troy, you're the man!

00:08:15.454 --> 00:08:17.498
because in two weeks
we're going to the championships

00:08:17.581 --> 00:08:19.667
with you leading us
to infinity and beyond.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.794
- What team?
- Wildcats!

00:08:22.003 --> 00:08:23.671
- What team?
- Wildcats!

00:08:36.851 --> 00:08:38.852
The ice princess has returned
from the North Pole.

00:08:38.936 --> 00:08:40.980
You know, she probably spent the holidays
the way she always does.

00:08:41.063 --> 00:08:43.274
- How's that?
- Shopping for mirrors.

00:08:46.444 --> 00:08:51.198
Behold the zoo animals
heralding the new year. How tribal.

00:08:54.118 --> 00:08:57.204
- Mom, my stomach...
- is always nervous on the first day at a new school.

00:08:57.288 --> 00:08:59.540
You'll do great.
You always do.

00:08:59.623 --> 00:09:03.294
And I made my company promise that I can't
be transferred again until you graduate.

00:09:03.377 --> 00:09:05.379
I reviewed your impressive transcripts.

00:09:05.463 --> 00:09:07.923
I expect your light will shine
very brightly here at East High.

00:09:08.007 --> 00:09:11.469
I don't want to be the school's
freaky genius girl again.

00:09:11.552 --> 00:09:14.221
Just be Gabriella.

00:09:14.305 --> 00:09:17.058
This way.

00:09:23.314 --> 00:09:24.440
Dude.

00:09:24.523 --> 00:09:26.525
- Troy. Troy.
- Hey.

00:09:26.609 --> 00:09:28.569
How's it going?
How are you?

00:09:32.323 --> 00:09:34.492
- Do you remember the night before?
- No. Not at all.

00:09:34.575 --> 00:09:37.578
All I remember is, like, pink jelly. I...

00:09:37.661 --> 00:09:39.705
Excuse me.

00:09:41.082 --> 00:09:43.417
- Hi, Troy.
- Hi.

00:09:43.501 --> 00:09:47.254
I trust you all had splendid holidays.

00:09:47.338 --> 00:09:51.801
Check the sign-up sheets in the lobby
for new activities, Mr Bolton.

00:09:51.884 --> 00:09:55.679
Especially our winter musicale.
We will have singles auditions...

00:09:55.763 --> 00:09:57.473
- You OK?
- Yeah.

00:09:57.556 --> 00:10:00.768
...and pairs auditions for our two leads.

00:10:00.851 --> 00:10:05.940
Mr Danforth, this is a place of learning,
not a hockey arena.

00:10:06.023 --> 00:10:11.320
There is also a final sign-up for next week's
scholastic decathlon competition.

00:10:11.403 --> 00:10:17.201
Chem Club president Taylor McKessie
can answer all of your questions about that.

00:10:17.952 --> 00:10:22.498
Ah, the cellphone menace
has returned to our crucible of learning.

00:10:22.581 --> 00:10:25.292
- Is it your phone?
- Sharpay and Ryan, cellphones.

00:10:25.376 --> 00:10:27.962
And I will see you in detention.

00:10:28.045 --> 00:10:30.881
We have zero tolerance
for cellphones in class,

00:10:30.965 --> 00:10:33.968
so we will get to know each other
in detention. Cellphone.

00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:39.974
And welcome to East High, Ms Montez.
Mr Bolton, I see your phone is involved.

00:10:40.057 --> 00:10:42.810
So we will see you in detention as well.

00:10:42.893 --> 00:10:45.729
No, no. That's not even a possibility,
Ms Darbus, Your Honour.

00:10:45.813 --> 00:10:48.816
See? 'Cause we have basketball practice,
and Troy...

00:10:48.899 --> 00:10:52.319
That will be 15 minutes for you too,
Mr Danforth. Count 'em.

00:10:52.403 --> 00:10:54.905
That could be tough for Chad,
since he probably can't count that high.

00:10:54.989 --> 00:10:57.074
Taylor McKessie, 15 minutes.

00:10:57.158 --> 00:11:02.079
Shall the carnage continue?
Holidays are over, people. Way over.

00:11:02.621 --> 00:11:06.083
Now, any more comments, questions?

00:11:06.917 --> 00:11:09.587
- Jason.
- So, how were your holidays, Ms Darbus?

00:11:11.297 --> 00:11:13.257
What?

00:11:20.139 --> 00:11:24.059
- Sorry, man. See you in detention.
- See you later, man. It's all good.

00:11:24.143 --> 00:11:26.103
She's crazy.

00:11:27.146 --> 00:11:28.772
Hey.

00:11:28.856 --> 00:11:30.065
- I don't...
- Believe it.

00:11:30.149 --> 00:11:32.276
- Well, me...
- Either. But how?

00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:35.529
My mom's company transferred her
here to Albuquerque.

00:11:35.613 --> 00:11:38.574
I can't believe you live here. I looked for you
at the lodge on New Year's Day, but...

00:11:38.657 --> 00:11:41.702
- I know. We had to leave first thing.
- Why are you whispering?

00:11:41.785 --> 00:11:46.707
What? Oh... Well, my friends
know about the snowboarding.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.043
I haven't quite told them
about the singing thing.

00:11:49.126 --> 00:11:50.669
- Hey, what's up, Troy?
- Hey, what's up.

00:11:50.753 --> 00:11:53.297
- Too much for them to handle?
- No, it was cool.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:57.426
But, you know, my friends.
It's - It's not what I do.

00:11:57.509 --> 00:12:00.304
That was, like, a - a different person.

00:12:03.349 --> 00:12:07.937
So anyway, welcome to East High.

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:11.482
Now that you've met Ms Darbus,
I bet you just can't wait to sign up for that.

00:12:11.565 --> 00:12:15.819
I won't be signing up for anything for a while.
I just wanna get to know the school.

00:12:15.903 --> 00:12:18.656
But if you sign up,
I'd consider coming to the show.

00:12:18.739 --> 00:12:22.785
- Yeah. Yeah. That's completely impossible.
- What's impossible, Troy?

00:12:22.868 --> 00:12:26.622
I wouldn't think "impossible"
is even in your vocabulary.

00:12:26.705 --> 00:12:30.000
So nice of you to
show our new classmate around.

00:12:38.842 --> 00:12:41.011
Were you going to sign up too?

00:12:41.095 --> 00:12:45.266
My brother and I have starred in all the school's
productions, and we really welcome newcomers.

00:12:45.349 --> 00:12:49.353
There are a lot of supporting roles in the show.
I'm sure we could find something for you.

00:12:49.436 --> 00:12:52.648
No, no, no. I was just looking
at all the bulletin boards.

00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:55.192
Lots going on at this school. Wow.

00:12:57.528 --> 00:12:59.613
Nice penmanship.

00:13:02.199 --> 00:13:06.287
So, Troy. I missed you during vacation.
What'd you do?

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:11.166
You know, played basketball,
snowboarding, more basketball.

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:14.169
- When's the big game?
- Two weeks.

00:13:14.253 --> 00:13:18.549
You are so dedicated.
Just like me.

00:13:18.632 --> 00:13:21.427
I hope you come watch me in the musical.
Promise?

00:13:23.721 --> 00:13:25.639
- Toodles!
- Toodles.

00:13:34.606 --> 00:13:37.192
So, dude,
you know that school musical thing?

00:13:37.276 --> 00:13:39.862
Is it true you get extra credit
just for auditioning?

00:13:39.945 --> 00:13:42.656
- Who cares?
- It's always good to get extra credit,

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:44.158
for college...

00:13:44.241 --> 00:13:47.703
Ever think LeBron James or Shaquille O'Neal
auditioned for their school musical?

00:13:47.786 --> 00:13:49.580
- Maybe.
- Troy.

00:13:49.663 --> 00:13:55.586
Look. The music in those shows isn't hip-hop,
okay, or rock, or anything essential to culture.

00:13:55.669 --> 00:14:01.091
It's, like, show music.
It's all costumes and make-up and...

00:14:01.175 --> 00:14:03.052
- Dude, it's frightening.
- Yeah, I know.

00:14:03.135 --> 00:14:05.512
I just thought it might be a good laugh.

00:14:05.596 --> 00:14:08.932
- Sharpay's kinda cute too.
- So is a mountain lion.

00:14:09.016 --> 00:14:11.310
But you don't pet it.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:16.398
All right, Wildcats! Pair up!

00:14:16.482 --> 00:14:17.483
Let's go!

00:14:17.608 --> 00:14:18.275
Come on!

00:14:33.791 --> 00:14:36.585
<i>Coach said to fake right and break left</i>

00:14:36.668 --> 00:14:38.379
<i>Watch out for the pick
and keep an eye on defence</i>

00:14:38.462 --> 00:14:40.798
<i>Gotta run the give-and-go
Take the ball to the hole</i>

00:14:40.881 --> 00:14:43.592
<i>And don't be afraid
to shoot the outside "J"</i>

00:14:43.675 --> 00:14:47.221
<i>Just keep your head in the game
Just keep your head in the game</i>

00:14:47.304 --> 00:14:49.473
<i>And don't be afraid
to shoot the outside "J"</i>

00:14:49.973 --> 00:14:53.602
<i>Just keep your head in the game
You gotta get your head in the game</i>

00:14:53.685 --> 00:14:55.270
<i>We gotta get our head in the game</i>

00:14:55.354 --> 00:14:57.731
<i>You gotta get your head in the game</i>

00:14:57.815 --> 00:14:59.733
<i>We gotta get our head in the game</i>

00:14:59.817 --> 00:15:01.819
<i>Come on, get your head in the game</i>

00:15:01.902 --> 00:15:03.987
<i>We gotta get our head in the game</i>

00:15:04.071 --> 00:15:05.739
<i>You gotta get your head in the game</i>

00:15:05.823 --> 00:15:08.200
<i>We gotta get our head in the game</i>

00:15:10.661 --> 00:15:12.996
<i>Let's make sure that we get the rebound</i>

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.124
<i>'Cause when we get it
then the crowd'll go wild</i>

00:15:15.207 --> 00:15:16.959
<i>A second chance,
gotta grab it and go</i>

00:15:17.042 --> 00:15:21.505
<i>Maybe this time we'll hit the right notes</i>

00:15:21.588 --> 00:15:23.590
<i>Wait a minute,
not the time and place</i>

00:15:23.674 --> 00:15:25.676
<i>Wait a minute,
get my head in the game</i>

00:15:25.884 --> 00:15:27.594
<i>Wait a minute,
get my head in the game</i>

00:15:27.678 --> 00:15:29.471
<i>Wait a minute, wait a minute</i>

00:15:29.555 --> 00:15:31.640
<i>I gotta get my head in the game</i>

00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:33.308
<i>You gotta get your head in the game</i>

00:15:33.392 --> 00:15:35.769
<i>I gotta get my head in the game</i>

00:15:35.853 --> 00:15:37.980
<i>You gotta get your head in the game</i>

00:15:38.063 --> 00:15:39.982
<i>Come on, get my head in the game</i>

00:15:40.065 --> 00:15:42.359
<i>You gotta get your head in the game</i>

00:15:42.443 --> 00:15:44.278
<i>I gotta get my head in the game</i>

00:15:44.361 --> 00:15:46.363
<i>You gotta get your head in the game</i>

00:15:47.281 --> 00:15:51.285
<i>Why am I feeling so wrong?</i>

00:15:51.368 --> 00:15:54.538
<i>My head's in the game
but my heart's in the song</i>

00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:57.458
<i>She makes this feel so right</i>

00:15:57.541 --> 00:15:59.334
Should I go for it?

00:15:59.418 --> 00:16:03.213
I better shake this. Yikes!

00:16:22.316 --> 00:16:24.526
<i>I gotta get my head in the game</i>

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:26.737
<i>You gotta get your head in the game</i>

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.739
<i>I gotta get my head in the game</i>

00:16:28.822 --> 00:16:31.033
<i>You gotta get your head in the game</i>

00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:32.993
<i>Come on, get my head in the game</i>

00:16:33.076 --> 00:16:34.745
<i>You gotta get your head in the game</i>

00:16:34.828 --> 00:16:37.164
<i>I gotta get my head in the game</i>

00:16:37.247 --> 00:16:39.583
<i>You gotta get your head in the game</i>

00:16:44.588 --> 00:16:46.089
- What team?
- Wildcats!

00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:47.508
- What team?
- Wildcats!

00:16:47.591 --> 00:16:48.592
- What team?
- Wildcats!

00:16:48.675 --> 00:16:52.304
- Wildcats!
- Get your head in the game!

00:17:04.942 --> 00:17:07.736
So, it seemed like you knew Troy Bolton.

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:10.739
Not really.
He was just showing me around.

00:17:10.821 --> 00:17:13.700
Well, Troy usually doesn't
interact with new students.

00:17:13.784 --> 00:17:18.413
- Why not?
- Well, it's pretty much basketball 24/7 with him.

00:17:18.497 --> 00:17:22.209
- That should be 16 over pi.
- Yes, Ms Montez?

00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:24.795
I'm sorry, I was just...

00:17:24.877 --> 00:17:27.798
Shouldn't the second equation
read 16 over pi?

00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:32.052
16 over pi?
That's quite impossible.

00:17:35.013 --> 00:17:37.683
I stand corrected.

00:17:41.645 --> 00:17:43.230
And welcome aboard.

00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:05.168
- Catch you later, guys.
- OK.

00:18:06.753 --> 00:18:09.298
Troy Bolton was looking at our audition list.

00:18:09.381 --> 00:18:10.882
Again?

00:18:11.758 --> 00:18:15.846
You know, he was hanging around with that
new girl and they were both looking at the list.

00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:21.685
There's something freaky about her.
Where did she say she was from?

00:18:37.868 --> 00:18:43.373
Wow! An Einsteinette. So why do you think
she's interested in our musical?

00:18:43.457 --> 00:18:48.170
I'm not sure that she is. And we needn't
concern ourselves with amateurs.

00:18:48.253 --> 00:18:50.964
But there is no harm in making certain

00:18:51.048 --> 00:18:57.179
that Gabriella's welcome to school activities
that are... well, appropriate for her.

00:18:57.262 --> 00:18:59.681
After all,

00:18:59.765 --> 00:19:01.808
she loves pi.

00:19:09.274 --> 00:19:11.818
Gold. More gold.

00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:18.075
Paint, paint. Let's go.

00:19:22.954 --> 00:19:25.082
The answer is yes!

00:19:25.165 --> 00:19:28.418
Our scholastic decathlon team
has its first competition next week,

00:19:28.502 --> 00:19:30.253
and there is certainly a spot for you.

00:19:30.337 --> 00:19:33.215
- Where did those come from?
- Didn't you put them in my locker?

00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:37.177
- Of course not.
- Oh. Well, we'd love to have you on our team.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.680
We meet almost every day after school.

00:19:39.763 --> 00:19:41.181
Please?

00:19:41.264 --> 00:19:45.060
I need to catch up on the curriculum here
before I think about joining any clubs.

00:19:45.143 --> 00:19:49.523
What a perfect way to get caught up -
meeting with the smartest kids in school.

00:19:49.606 --> 00:19:54.111
- What a generous offer, Taylor.
- So many new faces in detention today.

00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:59.282
I hope you don't make a habit of it, but
the drama club can always use an extra hand.

00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:06.123
And while we are working, let us probe
the mounting evils of cellphones.

00:20:07.541 --> 00:20:13.046
Come on, guys, huddle up!
We got two weeks to the big game.

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:15.549
Where's Troy and Chad?

00:20:17.676 --> 00:20:20.554
Don't make me ask again.

00:20:20.637 --> 00:20:23.974
- Where's Troy and Chad?!
- Detention.

00:20:29.896 --> 00:20:35.277
Perhaps the most heinous example of
cellphone abuse is ringing in the theatre.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:39.614
What temerity!
The theatre is a temple of art.

00:20:39.698 --> 00:20:43.160
A precious cornucopia of creative energy.

00:20:43.243 --> 00:20:45.662
Where's my team, Darbus?

00:20:45.746 --> 00:20:50.792
- What the heck are those two doing in a tree?
- It's called crime and punishment, Bolton.

00:20:50.876 --> 00:20:55.505
Beside, proximity to the arts
is cleansing for the soul.

00:20:55.589 --> 00:20:57.591
Can we have a talk, please?

00:20:57.674 --> 00:20:59.885
And you two, in the gym, now!

00:21:07.768 --> 00:21:11.772
If they have to paint sets for detention,
they could do it tonight, not during my practice.

00:21:11.855 --> 00:21:15.776
If these were theatre performers instead of
athletes, would you seek special treatment?

00:21:15.859 --> 00:21:19.029
Darbus, we are days away
from our biggest game of the year.

00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:23.950
And we, Bolton, are in the midst of our
auditions for our winter musicale as well.

00:21:24.034 --> 00:21:28.038
This school is about more than
just young men in baggy shorts

00:21:28.121 --> 00:21:30.624
flinging balls for touchdowns!

00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:33.210
Baskets! They shoot baskets.

00:21:33.293 --> 00:21:35.837
Stop! Guys. Listen.

00:21:35.921 --> 00:21:38.799
You've been having this argument since
the day you both started teaching here.

00:21:38.882 --> 00:21:44.554
We are one school, one student body,
one faculty. Can we not agree on that?

00:21:46.097 --> 00:21:50.936
So, Coach, how's the team lookin'?
Troy got 'em whipped into shape?

00:21:55.774 --> 00:21:59.236
West High Knights have knocked us out
of the play-offs three years running,

00:21:59.319 --> 00:22:03.824
and now we are one game away from
taking that championship right back from 'em.

00:22:03.907 --> 00:22:06.827
It's time to make our stand.

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:09.496
The team is you.

00:22:09.579 --> 00:22:12.040
You are the team.

00:22:12.123 --> 00:22:18.421
And this team does not exist unless each
and every one of you is fully focused on our goal.

00:22:18.505 --> 00:22:19.881
Am I clear?

00:22:19.965 --> 00:22:21.633
- Hey, what team?
- Wildcats!

00:22:21.842 --> 00:22:23.051
- What team?
- Wildcats!

00:22:23.134 --> 00:22:24.845
- What team?
- Wildcats!

00:22:24.928 --> 00:22:27.764
- Wildcats!
- Get your head in the game!

00:22:27.848 --> 00:22:30.934
We've never made it past the first round
of the scholastic decathlon.

00:22:31.017 --> 00:22:32.519
You could be our answered prayer.

00:22:32.602 --> 00:22:36.439
I'm gonna focus on my studies this semester
and help my mom get the new house organized.

00:22:36.523 --> 00:22:39.401
Maybe next year.
What do you know about Troy Bolton?

00:22:39.484 --> 00:22:42.237
Troy?

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.906
I wouldn't consider myself an expert
on that particular subspecies,

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:47.909
however, unless you speak cheerleader,
as in:

00:22:47.993 --> 00:22:52.706
"Oh, my gosh! Isn't Troy Bolton
just the hottie super-bum?"

00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:54.833
He's so beautiful.

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:59.921
- See what I mean?
- I guess I don't know how to speak cheerleader.

00:23:00.005 --> 00:23:03.258
Which is why we exist in an alternate
universe to Troy the basketball boy.

00:23:03.341 --> 00:23:04.718
Have you tried to get to know him?

00:23:04.801 --> 00:23:07.554
Watch how it works in the cafeteria
tomorrow when you have lunch with us.

00:23:07.637 --> 00:23:11.224
Unless you'd rather sit with the cheerleaders
and discuss the importance of firm nail beds.

00:23:11.308 --> 00:23:14.060
My nail beds are history.

00:23:14.144 --> 00:23:16.313
Sister!

00:23:19.649 --> 00:23:22.986
- I still don't understand this whole detention
thing. - It was my fault. I'm sorry, Dad.

00:23:23.069 --> 00:23:24.321
Cross court.

00:23:24.404 --> 00:23:29.910
You know, Darbus will take any opportunity to
bust my chops. And that includes yours too.

00:23:29.993 --> 00:23:31.328
Hey, Dad?

00:23:32.162 --> 00:23:35.999
Did you ever think about trying something new,
but were afraid of what your friends might think?

00:23:36.082 --> 00:23:38.627
You mean like going left?
You're doing fine. Come on.

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:40.921
Well, no.

00:23:41.004 --> 00:23:43.590
I mean, what if you wanna try
something really new

00:23:43.673 --> 00:23:47.344
and it's a total disaster
and all your friends laugh at you?

00:23:47.427 --> 00:23:49.596
Well, then maybe they're
not really your friends.

00:23:49.721 --> 00:23:53.433
I mean, that was my whole point about team today. You guys
gotta look out for each other, and you're the leader.

00:23:53.516 --> 00:23:56.937
- Yeah, but, Dad, I'm not talking... - There's gonna
be college scouts at our game next week, Troy.

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.939
Know what a scholarship
is worth these days?

00:23:59.022 --> 00:24:02.859
- A lot.
- Yeah. Focus, Troy, come on.

00:24:06.613 --> 00:24:07.614
All right.

00:24:17.123 --> 00:24:19.209
Just something for you.

00:24:25.382 --> 00:24:30.845
Well, I expect we all learned our homeroom
manners yesterday, people, correct?

00:24:30.929 --> 00:24:34.307
If not, we have some dressing rooms
that need painting.

00:24:34.391 --> 00:24:37.352
Now, a few announcements.

00:24:37.435 --> 00:24:42.565
This morning during free period will be
your chance for the musicale auditions,

00:24:42.649 --> 00:24:44.985
both single and pairs.

00:24:45.068 --> 00:24:47.153
I will be in the theatre until noon

00:24:47.237 --> 00:24:53.326
for those of you bold enough to extend
the wingspan of your creative spirit.

00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:55.704
What time is she due back
on the mother ship?

00:24:55.787 --> 00:24:58.123
...discussing the importance of Shakespeare.

00:24:59.708 --> 00:25:01.251
- Yo, what's up, man?
- Hey. What's up?

00:25:01.334 --> 00:25:03.628
Hey. So, look. The whole team's
hitting the gym during free period.

00:25:03.712 --> 00:25:06.172
- What do you want to have us run?
- Dude, you know what? I can't make it.

00:25:06.256 --> 00:25:08.800
- I gotta catch up on some homework.
- What?

00:25:08.883 --> 00:25:11.886
Hello. It's only the second day back.
I'm not even behind on homework yet.

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:14.681
And, you know, I've been behind
on homework since preschool.

00:25:14.764 --> 00:25:17.934
That's hilarious.
I'll catch you later.

00:25:19.769 --> 00:25:22.105
Homework?
There's no way.

00:25:30.113 --> 00:25:32.198
What is he doing?

00:25:33.324 --> 00:25:35.452
How's it going, man?

00:26:16.868 --> 00:26:18.995
Short cut.

00:26:20.371 --> 00:26:22.499
I'm late for class.

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:41.184
That's good, just leave it here.

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:08.670
This is where the true expression
of the artist is realized.

00:27:08.753 --> 00:27:13.299
Where inner truth is revealed
through the actor's journey, where...

00:27:13.383 --> 00:27:16.177
- Was that a cellphone?
- Is it mine?

00:27:16.261 --> 00:27:18.638
No, ma'am. That was the warning bell.

00:27:18.721 --> 00:27:22.475
Those wishing to audition must understand
that time is of the essence.

00:27:22.559 --> 00:27:26.729
We have many roles to cast
and final callbacks will be next week.

00:27:26.813 --> 00:27:29.399
First, you will sing a few bars
and I will tell give you a sense

00:27:29.482 --> 00:27:32.819
of whether or not
the theatre is your calling.

00:27:32.902 --> 00:27:36.156
Better to hear it from me now
than from your friends later.

00:27:36.239 --> 00:27:39.075
Our composer, Kelsi Nielsen,
will accompany you

00:27:39.159 --> 00:27:43.037
and be available for rehearsals
prior to callbacks.

00:27:43.121 --> 00:27:45.081
Shall we?

00:27:45.165 --> 00:27:49.377
<i>It's hard to believe that I couldn't see</i>

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:52.714
<i>That you were always right beside me</i>

00:27:52.797 --> 00:27:56.342
<i>This feeling like no other</i>

00:27:56.426 --> 00:27:59.137
<i>I want you to know</i>

00:28:02.432 --> 00:28:04.893
Yes, thank you.

00:28:04.976 --> 00:28:06.019
Next!

00:28:06.102 --> 00:28:09.022
<i>It's hard to believe</i>

00:28:09.105 --> 00:28:13.568
<i>That I couldn't sneeze... see</i>

00:28:13.651 --> 00:28:17.572
<i>That you were always right there next to...
beside me</i>

00:28:17.655 --> 00:28:22.869
Alan, I admire your pluck.
As to your singing...

00:28:22.952 --> 00:28:26.122
That's a wonderful tie
you're wearing. Next!

00:28:27.957 --> 00:28:32.795
<i>It's hard to believe that I couldn't see</i>

00:28:32.879 --> 00:28:36.382
<i>That you were always there beside me</i>

00:28:36.466 --> 00:28:40.386
<i>This feeling's like no other</i>

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:42.680
<i>I want you to know</i>

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.141
Stop.

00:28:45.225 --> 00:28:50.897
<i>...so lonely before I finally found</i>

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:53.775
<i>What I've been looking</i>

00:28:53.858 --> 00:28:56.069
<i>For</i>

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:02.492
Ah, Cyndra.

00:29:02.575 --> 00:29:08.748
What courage to pursue a note that has
not been accessed in the natural world.

00:29:08.831 --> 00:29:11.918
Bravo. Uh, brava.

00:29:12.001 --> 00:29:16.506
Perhaps the spring musicale.

00:29:35.525 --> 00:29:40.280
<i>- It's hard to believe that I could not see
- Couldn't see</i>

00:29:40.363 --> 00:29:43.116
<i>- That you were right beside me
- Beside me</i>

00:29:43.199 --> 00:29:45.827
<i>- Thought I was alone
- Alone</i>

00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:48.997
<i>- With no one to hold
- To hold</i>

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:53.418
<i>- But you were right beside me
- Beside me</i>

00:29:54.877 --> 00:29:59.132
Well, that was just... very disturbing.

00:29:59.215 --> 00:30:01.551
Go see a counsellor.

00:30:02.969 --> 00:30:04.053
Next!

00:30:05.305 --> 00:30:06.389
Hey.

00:30:07.473 --> 00:30:10.727
So you decided to sign up for something?

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:13.813
- No. You?
- No.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:18.901
Why are you hiding behind a mop?

00:30:18.985 --> 00:30:22.780
- Your friends don't know you're here, right?
- Right.

00:30:28.244 --> 00:30:30.079
Thank you. Next.

00:30:31.456 --> 00:30:35.918
Ms Darbus is a little harsh.

00:30:36.002 --> 00:30:38.671
The Wildcat superstar's afraid?

00:30:38.755 --> 00:30:41.215
No, no. I'm not afraid, I...

00:30:41.299 --> 00:30:43.718
I'm just scared.

00:30:43.801 --> 00:30:46.346
Me too. Hugely.

00:30:46.429 --> 00:30:52.352
And for the lead roles of Minnie and Arnold
we only have one couple signed up.

00:30:52.435 --> 00:30:56.939
Sharpay and Ryan, I think it might
be useful for you to give us a sense

00:30:57.023 --> 00:31:00.610
of why we gather in this hallowed hall.

00:31:08.368 --> 00:31:09.535
What key?

00:31:09.619 --> 00:31:13.664
We had our rehearsal pianist
do an arrangement.

00:31:22.715 --> 00:31:24.133
Go!

00:31:32.558 --> 00:31:36.479
<i>It's hard to believe that I couldn't see</i>

00:31:36.562 --> 00:31:39.232
<i>You were always there beside me</i>

00:31:39.315 --> 00:31:43.236
<i>Thought I was alone with no one to hold</i>

00:31:43.319 --> 00:31:45.822
<i>But you were always right beside me</i>

00:31:45.905 --> 00:31:49.242
<i>This feeling's like no other</i>

00:31:49.325 --> 00:31:52.412
<i>I want you to know</i>

00:31:52.495 --> 00:31:56.833
<i>I've never had someone
that knows me like you do</i>

00:31:56.916 --> 00:31:59.252
<i>The way you do</i>

00:31:59.335 --> 00:32:03.673
<i>I've never had someone
as good for me as you</i>

00:32:03.756 --> 00:32:06.134
<i>No one like you</i>

00:32:06.217 --> 00:32:11.097
<i>So lonely before I finally found</i>

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:14.600
<i>What I've been looking for</i>

00:32:20.022 --> 00:32:22.108
<i>So good to be seen</i>

00:32:22.191 --> 00:32:24.777
<i>So good to be heard</i>

00:32:24.861 --> 00:32:26.821
<i>Don't have to say a word</i>

00:32:26.904 --> 00:32:28.990
<i>Forso long I was lost</i>

00:32:29.073 --> 00:32:31.284
<i>So good to be found</i>

00:32:31.367 --> 00:32:35.621
<i>I'm lovin' having you around</i>

00:32:35.705 --> 00:32:39.125
<i>This feeling's like no other</i>

00:32:39.208 --> 00:32:42.128
<i>I want you to know</i>

00:32:42.211 --> 00:32:46.674
<i>I've never had someone
that knows me like you do</i>

00:32:46.757 --> 00:32:48.885
<i>The way you do</i>

00:32:48.968 --> 00:32:53.473
<i>I've never had someone
as good for me as you</i>

00:32:53.556 --> 00:32:55.975
<i>No one like you</i>

00:32:56.058 --> 00:33:00.980
<i>So lonely before I finally found</i>

00:33:01.063 --> 00:33:03.566
<i>What I've been looking for</i>

00:33:23.294 --> 00:33:25.087
I told you not to do the jazz squares.

00:33:25.171 --> 00:33:28.341
It's a crowd favourite.
Everybody loves a good jazz square.

00:33:32.803 --> 00:33:34.222
Well...

00:33:34.305 --> 00:33:37.099
Are there any last-minute sign-ups?

00:33:37.183 --> 00:33:42.688
Don't be discouraged. The theatre club
needs more than just singers. It needs fans too.

00:33:42.772 --> 00:33:44.524
Buy tickets.

00:33:44.607 --> 00:33:49.779
Actually, if you do the part with that
particular song, I imagined it much slow...

00:33:49.862 --> 00:33:52.865
If we do the part?

00:33:52.949 --> 00:33:56.702
Kelsi, my sawed-off Sondheim,

00:33:56.786 --> 00:33:59.789
I've been in 17 school productions,

00:33:59.872 --> 00:34:02.375
and how many times
have your compositions been selected?

00:34:02.458 --> 00:34:06.254
- This would be the first.
- Which tells us what?

00:34:06.337 --> 00:34:08.755
- That I need to write you more solos?
- No.

00:34:08.839 --> 00:34:12.510
It tells us that you do not offer direction,
suggestion or commentary.

00:34:12.592 --> 00:34:14.719
And you should be thankful
that me and Ryan are here

00:34:14.804 --> 00:34:16.722
to lift your music
out of its current obscurity.

00:34:16.806 --> 00:34:19.141
- Are we clear?
- Yes, ma'am. I mean, Sharpay.

00:34:21.476 --> 00:34:24.063
Nice talking to you.

00:34:24.146 --> 00:34:26.190
Any last-minute sign-ups?

00:34:27.358 --> 00:34:31.152
- We should go.
- No? Good. Done.

00:34:36.367 --> 00:34:37.952
I'd like to audition, Ms Darbus.

00:34:38.034 --> 00:34:41.581
Timeliness means something in the world
of theatre, young lady.

00:34:41.664 --> 00:34:46.793
The individual auditions are long, long over
and there are simply no other pairs.

00:34:46.877 --> 00:34:48.838
I'll sing with her.

00:34:52.007 --> 00:34:53.759
Troy Bolton?

00:34:53.842 --> 00:34:58.014
Where is your sports posse,
or whatever it's called?

00:34:58.097 --> 00:35:00.600
Team.

00:35:00.683 --> 00:35:04.145
But I'm here alone.
Actually, I'm here to sing with her.

00:35:04.228 --> 00:35:09.442
Yes, well, we take these shows
very seriously here at East High.

00:35:09.525 --> 00:35:12.778
I called for the pairs audition,
and you didn't respond.

00:35:12.862 --> 00:35:14.947
Free period is now over.

00:35:15.031 --> 00:35:20.620
- She has an amazing voice.
- Perhaps the next musicale.

00:35:34.884 --> 00:35:37.386
So, you're a composer?

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:40.723
You wrote the song
Ryan and Sharpay just sang?

00:35:40.806 --> 00:35:43.142
And the entire show?

00:35:43.225 --> 00:35:48.147
Well, that's really cool.
I - I can't wait to hear the rest of the show.

00:35:49.899 --> 00:35:52.234
So, why are you so afraid
of Ryan and Sharpay?

00:35:52.318 --> 00:35:54.987
- I mean, it is your show.
- It is?

00:35:55.071 --> 00:35:59.200
Isn't the composer of a show
kind of like the playmaker in basketball?

00:35:59.283 --> 00:36:00.409
Playmaker?

00:36:00.493 --> 00:36:02.578
You know, the one who makes
everyone else look good.

00:36:02.662 --> 00:36:06.082
I mean, without you there is no show.
You're the playmaker here, Kelsi.

00:36:06.165 --> 00:36:07.875
I am?

00:36:07.958 --> 00:36:12.838
Do you wanna hear how the duet's
supposed to sound?

00:36:26.936 --> 00:36:32.233
<i>It's hard to believe that I couldn't see</i>

00:36:32.316 --> 00:36:35.736
<i>You were always there beside me</i>

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:40.783
<i>Thought I was alone with no one to hold</i>

00:36:40.866 --> 00:36:44.120
<i>But you were always right beside me</i>

00:36:44.203 --> 00:36:48.958
<i>This feeling's like no other</i>

00:36:49.041 --> 00:36:52.253
<i>I want you to know</i>

00:36:52.336 --> 00:36:58.217
<i>That I've never had someone
that knows me like you do</i>

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.720
<i>The way you do</i>

00:37:00.803 --> 00:37:06.892
<i>And I've never had someone
as good for me as you</i>

00:37:06.976 --> 00:37:10.396
<i>No one like you</i>

00:37:10.479 --> 00:37:16.402
<i>So lonely before I finally found</i>

00:37:16.485 --> 00:37:20.406
<i>What I've been looking for</i>

00:37:33.002 --> 00:37:35.755
Wow. That's nice.

00:37:35.838 --> 00:37:38.674
Bolton, Montez - you have a callback.

00:37:38.758 --> 00:37:42.511
Kelsi, give them the duet from
the second act. Work on it with them.

00:37:42.595 --> 00:37:47.850
All right. If you guys wanna rehearse, I'm usually
here during free period and after school,

00:37:47.933 --> 00:37:51.812
and even sometimes during biology class.
You can come and rehearse any time.

00:37:51.896 --> 00:37:55.608
Or you can come to my house for breakfast.
I have a piano, we can rehearse there.

00:37:55.691 --> 00:38:00.321
After school, before school -
whatever works. After basketball class...

00:38:00.404 --> 00:38:01.197
What?

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.949
Callback?!

00:38:06.535 --> 00:38:10.623
"Callback for roles Arnold and Minnie
next Thursday, 3.30 p.m."

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:15.628
"Ryan and Sharpay Evans,
Gabriella Montez and Troy Bolton."

00:38:15.711 --> 00:38:18.672
Is this some kind of joke?
They didn't even audition!

00:38:18.756 --> 00:38:20.549
- Maybe we're being punk'd.
- What?

00:38:20.633 --> 00:38:23.969
Maybe we're being filmed right now.
Maybe we'll get to meet Ashton!

00:38:24.053 --> 00:38:26.305
Shut up, Ryan!

00:38:26.388 --> 00:38:28.474
What's wrong?

00:38:30.893 --> 00:38:32.937
What?

00:38:42.738 --> 00:38:45.908
How dare she sign up?! I've already picked out
the colours for my dressing room.

00:38:45.991 --> 00:38:49.495
And she hasn't even asked our permission
to join the drama club.

00:38:49.578 --> 00:38:53.290
- Someone's gotta tell her the rules.
- Exactly.

00:38:54.667 --> 00:38:57.461
And what are the rules?

00:39:11.684 --> 00:39:17.022
<i>You can bet there's nothin' but net
When I am in a zone and on a roll</i>

00:39:17.106 --> 00:39:20.109
<i>But I got a confession,
my own secret obsession</i>

00:39:20.192 --> 00:39:23.445
<i>And it's making me lose control</i>

00:39:23.529 --> 00:39:27.283
<i>Everybody gather round</i>

00:39:27.366 --> 00:39:30.911
Well, if Troy can tell his secret,
then I can tell mine. I bake.

00:39:30.995 --> 00:39:32.746
- What?
- I love to bake.

00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:35.207
Strudels, scones, even apple pandowdy.

00:39:35.291 --> 00:39:37.251
<i>Not another sound</i>

00:39:37.334 --> 00:39:40.212
Someday I hope to make
the perfect crème brûlée.

00:39:40.296 --> 00:39:42.214
<i>No, no, no, no</i>

00:39:42.298 --> 00:39:44.425
<i>No, no, no</i>

00:39:44.508 --> 00:39:47.052
<i>Stick to the stuff you know</i>

00:39:47.136 --> 00:39:50.389
<i>If you wanna be cool
follow one simple rule</i>

00:39:50.472 --> 00:39:53.392
<i>Don't mess with the flow, no, no</i>

00:39:53.475 --> 00:39:56.729
<i>Stick to the status quo</i>

00:39:56.812 --> 00:39:59.440
<i>Look at me and what do you see?</i>

00:39:59.523 --> 00:40:01.984
<i>Intelligence beyond compare</i>

00:40:02.067 --> 00:40:05.237
<i>But inside I am stirring,
something strange is occurring</i>

00:40:05.321 --> 00:40:07.990
<i>It's a secret I need to share</i>

00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:11.911
<i>Open up, dig way down deep</i>

00:40:11.994 --> 00:40:17.416
Hip-hop is my passion.
I love to pop and lock and jam and break.

00:40:17.499 --> 00:40:18.792
Is that even legal?

00:40:18.876 --> 00:40:20.753
<i>Not another peep</i>

00:40:20.836 --> 00:40:23.589
It's just dancing. Sometimes I think
it's cooler than homework.

00:40:23.672 --> 00:40:25.799
<i>No, no, no, no</i>

00:40:25.883 --> 00:40:27.760
<i>No, no, no</i>

00:40:27.843 --> 00:40:30.262
<i>Stick to the stuff you know</i>

00:40:30.346 --> 00:40:33.641
<i>It is better by far
to keep things as they are</i>

00:40:33.724 --> 00:40:36.852
<i>Don't mess with the flow, no, no</i>

00:40:36.936 --> 00:40:40.189
<i>Stick to the status quo</i>

00:40:40.272 --> 00:40:45.277
<i>Listen well, I'm ready to tell
About a need that I cannot deny</i>

00:40:45.361 --> 00:40:48.614
<i>Dude, there's no explanation
for this awesome sensation</i>

00:40:48.697 --> 00:40:51.867
<i>But I'm ready to let it fly</i>

00:40:51.951 --> 00:40:54.954
<i>Speak your mind and you'll be heard</i>

00:40:55.037 --> 00:40:58.499
All right. If Troy wants to be a singer,
then I'm coming clean. I play the cello.

00:40:58.582 --> 00:41:00.876
Awesome! What is it?

00:41:01.251 --> 00:41:03.879
- A saw?
- No, dude, it's like a giant violin.

00:41:03.963 --> 00:41:06.215
<i>Not another word</i>

00:41:06.298 --> 00:41:08.968
- Do you have to wear a costume?
- Coat and tie.

00:41:09.051 --> 00:41:10.719
<i>No, no, no, no</i>

00:41:10.803 --> 00:41:12.888
<i>No, no, no</i>

00:41:12.972 --> 00:41:15.641
<i>Stick to the stuff you know</i>

00:41:15.724 --> 00:41:18.727
<i>If you wanna be cool,
follow one simple rule</i>

00:41:18.811 --> 00:41:21.855
<i>Don't mess with the flow, no, no</i>

00:41:21.939 --> 00:41:25.818
<i>Stick to the status quo</i>

00:41:25.901 --> 00:41:27.987
<i>No, no, no</i>

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:30.572
<i>Stick to the stuff you know</i>

00:41:30.656 --> 00:41:33.492
<i>It is better by far
to keep things as they are</i>

00:41:33.575 --> 00:41:36.870
<i>Don't mess with the flow, no, no</i>

00:41:36.954 --> 00:41:39.748
<i>Stick to the status quo</i>

00:42:03.814 --> 00:42:06.734
<i>This is not what I want</i>

00:42:06.817 --> 00:42:09.778
<i>This is not what I planned</i>

00:42:09.862 --> 00:42:12.740
<i>And I just gotta say</i>

00:42:12.823 --> 00:42:16.076
<i>I do not understand</i>

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:19.246
<i>Something is really</i>

00:42:19.329 --> 00:42:21.123
<i>Something's not right</i>

00:42:21.206 --> 00:42:24.877
<i>Really wrong</i>

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:30.883
<i>And we've gotta get things back
where they belong</i>

00:42:30.966 --> 00:42:32.384
<i>- We can do it
- Gotta play</i>

00:42:32.468 --> 00:42:34.720
<i>- Stick with what you know
- We can do it</i>

00:42:34.803 --> 00:42:36.889
<i>- Hip-hop hooray
- She has got to go</i>

00:42:36.972 --> 00:42:38.724
<i>- We can do it
- Crème brûlée</i>

00:42:38.807 --> 00:42:39.892
<i>Keep your voice down low</i>

00:42:39.975 --> 00:42:41.393
<i>- Not another peep
- No</i>

00:42:41.477 --> 00:42:43.145
<i>- Not another word
- No</i>

00:42:43.228 --> 00:42:44.730
<i>- Not another sound
- No</i>

00:42:44.813 --> 00:42:47.399
<i>Everybody quiet!</i>

00:42:49.485 --> 00:42:52.279
- Why is everybody staring at you?
- Not me, you.

00:42:52.362 --> 00:42:56.158
Because of the callbacks?
I can't have people staring at me. I really can't.

00:42:56.241 --> 00:42:58.911
<i>No, no, no, no</i>

00:42:58.994 --> 00:43:01.830
<i>Stick to the stuff you know</i>

00:43:01.914 --> 00:43:04.416
<i>If you want to be cool,
follow one simple rule</i>

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:08.087
<i>Don't mess with the flow, no, no</i>

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:11.632
<i>Stick to the status quo</i>

00:43:11.715 --> 00:43:13.926
<i>No, no, no</i>

00:43:14.009 --> 00:43:16.512
<i>Stick to the stuff you know</i>

00:43:16.595 --> 00:43:19.640
<i>It is better by far
to keep things as they are</i>

00:43:19.723 --> 00:43:22.518
<i>Don't mess with the flow, no, no</i>

00:43:22.601 --> 00:43:25.813
<i>Stick to the status,
stick to the status</i>

00:43:25.896 --> 00:43:29.191
<i>Stick to the status quo</i>

00:43:34.696 --> 00:43:36.740
I am so sorry.

00:43:38.909 --> 00:43:41.662
You do not want to get into that, man.
Too much drama.

00:43:41.745 --> 00:43:45.165
- Yeah.
- What is going on here?

00:43:45.249 --> 00:43:48.502
Look at this! That Gabriella girl
just dumped her lunch on me!

00:43:48.585 --> 00:43:52.005
On purpose. It's all part of their plan
to ruin our musical.

00:43:52.089 --> 00:43:55.551
And Troy and his basketball robots
are obviously behind it.

00:43:55.634 --> 00:43:57.386
Why do you think he auditioned?

00:43:57.469 --> 00:44:01.306
After all the hard work
you've put into the show.

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:04.268
It just doesn't seem right.

00:44:07.312 --> 00:44:10.983
- What's up?
- What's up? Let's see.

00:44:11.066 --> 00:44:14.403
You missed free period workout yesterday
to audition for some heinous musical.

00:44:14.486 --> 00:44:17.531
And now suddenly people are confessing.

00:44:17.614 --> 00:44:21.493
Yeah, and Zeke.
Zeke is baking, crème brûlée.

00:44:21.577 --> 00:44:22.703
What's that?

00:44:22.786 --> 00:44:25.998
It's a creamy custard-like filling with
a caramelized surface. It's really satisfying.

00:44:26.081 --> 00:44:28.834
Shut up, Zeke.

00:44:28.917 --> 00:44:32.337
Look. Do you see
what's happening here, man?

00:44:32.421 --> 00:44:35.382
Our team is coming apart
because of your singing thing.

00:44:35.465 --> 00:44:40.262
Look. Even the drama geeks and the brainiacs
suddenly think that they can talk to us.

00:44:40.345 --> 00:44:43.098
- Look. The skater dudes are mingling.
- Yo. - Yo.

00:44:43.182 --> 00:44:48.353
Suddenly people think that they can do
other stuff. Okay, stuff that's not their stuff.

00:44:48.437 --> 00:44:54.693
They've got you thinking about show tunes,
when we've got a play-off game next week.

00:45:06.288 --> 00:45:08.373
Heads up.

00:45:19.635 --> 00:45:21.220
All right, Bolton.

00:45:21.303 --> 00:45:24.056
Cards on the table right now.

00:45:24.139 --> 00:45:28.060
You're tweaked because I put your stars
in detention and now you're getting even.

00:45:28.143 --> 00:45:32.731
- What are you talking about, Darbus?
- Your all-star son turned up at my audition.

00:45:32.814 --> 00:45:35.734
Now, I give every student an even chance,

00:45:35.817 --> 00:45:38.612
which is a long and honourable tradition
in the theatre.

00:45:38.695 --> 00:45:41.240
Something that you wouldn't understand.

00:45:41.323 --> 00:45:46.995
But if he is planning some sort of
a practical joke in my chapel of the arts...

00:45:47.079 --> 00:45:51.124
- Troy doesn't even sing.
- Well, you're wrong about that.

00:45:51.208 --> 00:45:56.505
But I will not allow my <i>Twinkle Town</i>
musicale to be made into farce.

00:45:56.588 --> 00:45:58.840
<i>- Twinkle Town</i> ?
- See?

00:45:59.591 --> 00:46:03.178
I knew it. I knew it!

00:46:04.346 --> 00:46:08.183
Sounds like a winner.
Good luck on Broadway.

00:46:10.018 --> 00:46:13.188
Is Sharpay really, really mad at me?
I said I was sorry.

00:46:13.272 --> 00:46:16.775
Look. No one has beaten out Sharpay
for a musical since kindergarten.

00:46:16.858 --> 00:46:21.196
I wasn't trying to beat anyone out. We
didn't even audition, we were just singing.

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:23.240
You won't convince Sharpay of that.
I'm telling you.

00:46:23.365 --> 00:46:27.828
If that girl could figure out a way to play both Romeo
and Juliet, her own brother would be aced out of a job.

00:46:27.911 --> 00:46:31.999
I told you, it just happened.
But I liked it.

00:46:32.082 --> 00:46:34.293
A lot.

00:46:34.376 --> 00:46:37.379
Did you ever feel like there's
this whole other person inside of you

00:46:37.462 --> 00:46:39.923
just looking for a way to come out?

00:46:41.133 --> 00:46:43.260
Not really. No.

00:46:46.805 --> 00:46:48.557
Let's go.

00:46:51.059 --> 00:46:54.229
Hey, Sharpay. I just thought since
Troy Bolton's gonna be in your show...

00:46:54.313 --> 00:46:56.565
Troy Bolton is not in my show.

00:46:56.648 --> 00:47:01.987
OK. Well, I just thought maybe you could
watch me play ball sometime or something.

00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:06.825
- I'd rather stick pins in my eyes.
- Wouldn't that be awfully uncomfortable?

00:47:06.908 --> 00:47:08.660
Evaporate, tall person!

00:47:10.579 --> 00:47:12.414
I bake.

00:47:12.497 --> 00:47:14.583
If that helps.

00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:40.025
Wow!

00:47:40.108 --> 00:47:44.696
- It's like a jungle up here.
- Yeah, just like that cafeteria.

00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:47.449
I just humiliated myself
into the next century.

00:47:47.532 --> 00:47:50.869
- No! Come on.
- So this is your private hideout?

00:47:50.952 --> 00:47:55.457
Yeah. Thanks to the science club. Which
means my buddies don't even know it exists.

00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:58.377
You pretty much have the school wired,
don't you, Troy?

00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:02.214
Seems to me like everyone on campus
wants to be your friend.

00:48:02.297 --> 00:48:04.383
Unless we lose.

00:48:04.466 --> 00:48:06.802
I'm sure it's tricky being the coach's son.

00:48:06.885 --> 00:48:09.763
Makes me practise
a little harder, I guess.

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:14.851
- I don't know what he's gonna say when he
finds out about the singing. - You worried?

00:48:15.644 --> 00:48:18.230
My parents' friends are always saying:

00:48:18.313 --> 00:48:20.899
"Your son's the basketball guy."

00:48:20.982 --> 00:48:25.237
"You must be so proud."

00:48:27.322 --> 00:48:31.076
Sometimes I don't wanna be
the "basketball guy".

00:48:31.159 --> 00:48:33.703
I just wanna be a guy. You know?

00:48:34.496 --> 00:48:38.083
I saw the way you treated Kelsi
at the audition yesterday.

00:48:38.166 --> 00:48:41.336
Do your friends know that guy?

00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:45.966
- To them, I'm the playmaker dude.
- Then they don't know enough about you, Troy.

00:48:46.049 --> 00:48:49.594
At my other schools
I was the freaky math girl.

00:48:49.678 --> 00:48:54.099
It's cool coming here and being
anyone I wanna be.

00:48:54.182 --> 00:48:58.103
When I was singing with you
I just felt like a girl.

00:48:58.186 --> 00:49:00.605
You even look like one too.

00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:09.156
Do you remember in kindergarten how you'd
meet a kid and know nothing about them,

00:49:09.239 --> 00:49:12.033
then 10 seconds later you're playing
like you're best friends

00:49:12.117 --> 00:49:14.995
because you didn't have
to be anything but yourself?

00:49:15.078 --> 00:49:17.622
- Yeah.
- Singing with you felt like that.

00:49:19.207 --> 00:49:24.546
Well, I never thought about singing.
That's for sure.

00:49:24.629 --> 00:49:26.465
Till you.

00:49:26.548 --> 00:49:29.885
So you really wanna do the callbacks?

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:33.763
Hey. Just call me freaky callback boy.

00:49:35.891 --> 00:49:37.976
You're a cool guy, Troy.

00:49:38.059 --> 00:49:41.188
But not for the reasons your friends think.

00:49:41.271 --> 00:49:44.816
And thanks for showing me
your top-secret hiding place.

00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:46.943
Like kindergarten.

00:50:07.839 --> 00:50:10.091
<i>We're soarin'</i>

00:50:10.175 --> 00:50:12.636
<i>Flyin'</i>

00:50:16.473 --> 00:50:18.350
<i>But your faith</i>

00:50:18.433 --> 00:50:20.352
<i>Gives me strength</i>

00:50:20.435 --> 00:50:23.772
<i>Strength to believe</i>

00:50:24.439 --> 00:50:25.941
<i>Breakin'...</i>

00:50:34.533 --> 00:50:38.954
<i>Creating space between us</i>

00:51:14.155 --> 00:51:17.742
<i>There's not a star in heaven that we...</i>

00:51:17.826 --> 00:51:20.412
<i>Flyin'</i>

00:51:20.495 --> 00:51:24.416
<i>There's not a star in heaven that we...</i>

00:51:25.584 --> 00:51:29.504
Let's go, guys. Make it sharp.
To the chest. To the chest, come on. Pop it.

00:51:29.588 --> 00:51:32.257
Come on, guys.
Step with it. Let's go.

00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:34.843
Come on, move it.
Let's go.

00:51:34.926 --> 00:51:38.138
Come on, guys, focus. Focus.
Get your head in the game.

00:51:38.221 --> 00:51:40.473
Move it.

00:51:40.557 --> 00:51:43.351
- You seen Troy?
- No, Coach.

00:51:45.186 --> 00:51:46.396
Again, let's go!

00:52:09.878 --> 00:52:16.134
That's it, guys. Hit the showers.
Good hustle. Let's see that in the game.

00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:22.140
I think I'm gonna stay a while.
Work on some free throws.

00:52:22.223 --> 00:52:27.228
Well, since you missed practice, I think your
team deserves a little effort from you today.

00:52:35.737 --> 00:52:37.155
Wow.

00:52:37.238 --> 00:52:40.241
So this is your real stage.

00:52:40.325 --> 00:52:42.911
Yeah. I guess you could call it that.

00:52:43.411 --> 00:52:45.455
Or just a smelly gym.

00:52:49.668 --> 00:52:51.836
Don't tell me you're good at hoops too.

00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:55.090
You know, I once scored 41 points
on a league championship game.

00:52:55.173 --> 00:52:56.174
No way.

00:52:56.257 --> 00:53:00.512
Yeah, and the same day, I invented
the space shuttle and microwave popcorn.

00:53:00.595 --> 00:53:03.181
Microwave popcorn.
Funny.

00:53:06.768 --> 00:53:11.356
- I've been rehearsing with Kelsi.
- Me too. And, by the way,

00:53:11.439 --> 00:53:16.069
I missed practice. So if I get kicked off
the team it should be on your conscience.

00:53:16.152 --> 00:53:19.447
- Hey, I wasn't the one who told you...
- Gabriella, chill.

00:53:21.116 --> 00:53:25.120
Hey, that's travelling.
No, that's really bad travelling.

00:53:25.203 --> 00:53:28.540
Miss! I'm sorry, this is a closed practice.

00:53:29.791 --> 00:53:33.420
- Dad, come on. Practice is over.
- Not till the last player leaves the gym. Team rule.

00:53:33.503 --> 00:53:35.630
I'm sorry, sir.

00:53:35.714 --> 00:53:39.718
- Dad, this is Gabriella Montez.
- Your detention buddy.

00:53:42.137 --> 00:53:44.264
I'll see you later, Troy.

00:53:44.347 --> 00:53:46.641
Nice meeting you, Coach Bolton.

00:53:47.976 --> 00:53:50.979
You as well, Ms Montez.

00:53:52.313 --> 00:53:54.816
Dad, detention was my fault,
not hers.

00:53:54.899 --> 00:53:58.403
You haven't missed practice in three years.
That girl shows up...

00:53:58.486 --> 00:54:02.115
That girl is named Gabriella.
And she's very nice.

00:54:02.198 --> 00:54:06.619
Well, helping you miss practice doesn't make
her very nice. Not in my book or your team's.

00:54:06.703 --> 00:54:08.913
Dad, she's not a problem.
She's just a girl.

00:54:08.997 --> 00:54:12.417
But you're not just a guy, Troy.

00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:14.753
You're the team leader.

00:54:14.836 --> 00:54:18.757
What you do affects not only this team,
but the entire school.

00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:24.179
And without you completely focused,
we're not gonna win next week.

00:54:24.262 --> 00:54:27.640
The championship games -
they don't come along all the time.

00:54:27.724 --> 00:54:32.437
- They're something special.
- Yeah, well, a lot of things are special, Dad.

00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:36.775
But you're a playmaker,
not a singer, right?

00:54:36.858 --> 00:54:40.278
Did you ever think maybe I could be both?

00:54:50.955 --> 00:54:52.791
What?

00:54:52.874 --> 00:54:54.751
Let's go.

00:54:56.169 --> 00:54:59.964
What spell has this elevated-IQ
temptress girl cast

00:55:00.048 --> 00:55:01.966
that suddenly makes you
wanna be in a musical?

00:55:02.050 --> 00:55:04.135
Look, I just did it. Who cares?

00:55:04.219 --> 00:55:07.639
Who cares? How about your
most loyal best friend?

00:55:07.722 --> 00:55:11.518
- Quiet in here, Mr Danforth.
- It's him, Ms Falstaff, not me.

00:55:11.601 --> 00:55:17.148
Look, you're a hoops dude,
not a musical singer person.

00:55:17.232 --> 00:55:19.484
Have you ever seen Michael Crawford
on a cereal box?

00:55:19.567 --> 00:55:23.780
- Who's Michael Crawford?
- Exactly my point.

00:55:23.863 --> 00:55:26.157
He was the Phantom of the Opera
on Broadway.

00:55:26.241 --> 00:55:29.869
Now, my mom, she's seen
that musical 27 times,

00:55:29.953 --> 00:55:35.250
and she put Michael Crawford's picture
in our refrigerator. Yeah, not on it, in it.

00:55:35.333 --> 00:55:39.629
So my point is, if you play basketball,
you're gonna end up on the cereal box.

00:55:39.712 --> 00:55:42.674
If you sing in musicals, you're gonna
end up in my mom's refrigerator.

00:55:42.757 --> 00:55:44.425
Why would she put his picture
in her refrigerator?

00:55:44.509 --> 00:55:49.472
One of her crazy diet ideas. Look. I don't
attempt to understand the female mind, Troy.

00:55:49.556 --> 00:55:52.058
It's frightening territory.

00:55:55.562 --> 00:55:59.315
How can you expect the rest of us
to be focused on a game

00:55:59.399 --> 00:56:02.527
if you're off somewhere in leotards
singing "Twinkle Town"?

00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:04.612
No one said anything about leotards.

00:56:04.696 --> 00:56:06.781
Not yet, my friend, but just you wait.

00:56:06.865 --> 00:56:09.701
Look, we need you, Captain.
Big time.

00:56:09.784 --> 00:56:13.705
- Mr Danforth.
- I tried to tell him, Ms Falstaff.

00:56:13.788 --> 00:56:16.291
Really tried.

00:56:20.169 --> 00:56:22.255
Something isn't right.

00:56:25.216 --> 00:56:29.178
Hey. Look, we need to talk.

00:56:29.262 --> 00:56:30.972
Go.

00:56:31.055 --> 00:56:35.393
They must be trying to figure out a way to make
sure Troy and Gabriella actually beat us out.

00:56:35.476 --> 00:56:39.647
Now, the jocks rule most of the school,
but if they get Troy into the musical, then

00:56:39.731 --> 00:56:41.983
they've conquered the entire student body.

00:56:42.066 --> 00:56:46.070
And if those science girls get Gabriella
hooked up with Troy Bolton,

00:56:46.154 --> 00:56:50.033
the scholastic club goes from drool to cool.

00:56:50.116 --> 00:56:52.619
Ryan, we need to save our show
from people

00:56:52.702 --> 00:56:58.207
who don't know the difference
between a Tony Award and Tony Hawk.

00:56:59.250 --> 00:57:00.752
Do you really think that's gonna work?

00:57:00.835 --> 00:57:04.380
It's the only way to save Troy and Gabriella
from themselves.

00:57:04.464 --> 00:57:05.757
- So we on?
- Yeah.

00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:09.344
- Good. So we start tomorrow, then.
- OK, the first thing.

00:57:09.427 --> 00:57:11.304
Nice.

00:57:11.387 --> 00:57:12.847
- Let's go.
- Cool.

00:57:24.233 --> 00:57:27.946
Okay. So, my watch is 7.45 Mountain
Standard time. We synced?

00:57:28.029 --> 00:57:31.032
- Whatever. - All right. Then we're on a
go mode for lunch period, exactly 12.05.

00:57:31.115 --> 00:57:35.453
Yes, Chad, we're a go.
But we're not <i>Charlie's Angels,</i> OK?

00:57:35.536 --> 00:57:37.705
I can dream, can't I?

00:57:54.889 --> 00:57:57.517
"Spider" Bill Netrine.

00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:01.479
Class of '72. He was the MVP
the league championship game.

00:58:01.562 --> 00:58:07.485
Sam Nedler, class of '02.
Also known as "Sammy Slamma Jamma".

00:58:07.568 --> 00:58:10.863
Captain, MVP of the league
championship team.

00:58:10.947 --> 00:58:13.992
The "Thunder Clap" Hap Hadden, '95.

00:58:14.075 --> 00:58:17.578
Led the Wildcats to back-to-back
city championships. A legend.

00:58:17.662 --> 00:58:20.081
Yes. Legends, one and all.

00:58:20.164 --> 00:58:24.752
But do you think that any of these
Wildcat legends became legends

00:58:24.836 --> 00:58:29.215
by getting involved in musical auditions
just days before the league championships?

00:58:29.298 --> 00:58:31.259
- Get your head in the game!
- No.

00:58:31.342 --> 00:58:35.722
These Wildcat legends became legends
because they never took their eye off the prize.

00:58:35.805 --> 00:58:37.473
- Get your head in the game!
- Now,

00:58:37.557 --> 00:58:41.561
who was the first sophomore ever
to make starting varsity?

00:58:41.644 --> 00:58:42.228
Troy!

00:58:42.311 --> 00:58:45.231
- So who voted him our team captain this year?
- Us!

00:58:45.314 --> 00:58:47.817
And who is gonna get
their sorry butts kicked

00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:50.945
in Friday's championship game
if Troy's worried about an audition?

00:58:51.029 --> 00:58:53.281
- We are.
- Guys, come on.

00:58:53.364 --> 00:58:55.450
I mean, there's 12 people
on this team, not just me.

00:58:55.533 --> 00:58:56.743
Just 12?

00:58:56.826 --> 00:58:57.994
Oh, no.

00:58:58.077 --> 00:59:04.333
I think you're forgetting about one
very important 13th member of our squad.

00:59:07.336 --> 00:59:09.797
- My dad.
- Yes, Troy.

00:59:09.881 --> 00:59:13.843
Wildcat basketball champion,
class of 1981.

00:59:13.926 --> 00:59:17.847
Champion, father, and now coach.

00:59:18.973 --> 00:59:22.226
It's a winning tradition like no other.

00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:26.689
From lowly Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon,
to early warriors, medieval knights,

00:59:26.773 --> 00:59:28.733
all leading up to...

00:59:30.109 --> 00:59:32.570
lunkhead basketball man.

00:59:32.653 --> 00:59:36.157
Yes, our culture worshipped the aggressor
throughout the ages,

00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:39.494
and we end up with spoiled,
overpaid bonehead athletes

00:59:39.577 --> 00:59:44.373
who contribute little to civilization
other than slam dunks and touchdowns.

00:59:44.457 --> 00:59:49.504
That is the inevitable world
of Troy Bolton.

00:59:49.587 --> 00:59:52.882
But the path of the mind,
the path we're on,

00:59:52.965 --> 00:59:56.260
ours is the path that
has brought us these people:

00:59:56.344 --> 01:00:00.765
Eleanor Roosevelt, Frida Kahlo,
Sandra Day O'Connor,

01:00:00.848 --> 01:00:03.935
Madame Curie,
Jane Goodall, Oprah Winfrey,

01:00:04.018 --> 01:00:07.021
and so many others
who the world reveres.

01:00:07.105 --> 01:00:12.068
But what has...? You know,
I've got Kelsi waiting for me to rehearse.

01:00:12.151 --> 01:00:14.195
Gabriella! Sorry.

01:00:14.278 --> 01:00:17.532
Troy Bolton represents
one side of evolution.

01:00:17.615 --> 01:00:20.952
And our side, the side of education
and accomplishment,

01:00:21.035 --> 01:00:24.205
is the future of civilization.

01:00:24.288 --> 01:00:28.376
This is the side where you belong.

01:00:28.459 --> 01:00:35.174
Guys, if you don't know that I'll put 110% of
my guts into that game, then you don't know me.

01:00:35.258 --> 01:00:38.094
- But we just thought...
- No, I'll tell you what I thought.

01:00:38.177 --> 01:00:42.515
I thought that you're my friends.
Win together, lose together, teammates.

01:00:42.598 --> 01:00:46.269
But suddenly the girl.
And the singing.

01:00:46.352 --> 01:00:50.731
Man, I'm for the team! I've always been
for the team. She's just someone I met.

01:00:50.815 --> 01:00:54.569
All right, the singing thing is nothing.
Probably just a way to keep my nerves down.

01:00:54.652 --> 01:00:58.656
I don't know. It means nothing to me.
You're my guys and this is our team.

01:00:58.739 --> 01:01:00.741
Gabriella is not important.

01:01:00.825 --> 01:01:05.955
I'll forget about her, I'll forget the audition,
and we'll go out and get that championship.

01:01:06.038 --> 01:01:10.501
- Everyone happy now?
- Behold lunkhead basketball man.

01:01:13.546 --> 01:01:18.801
So, Gabriella, we'd love to have you
for the scholastic decathlon.

01:01:18.885 --> 01:01:21.470
Did you wanna grab some lunch?

01:01:22.889 --> 01:01:25.474
Well, we'll be there if you wanna come.

01:01:27.476 --> 01:01:29.979
- Wildcats!
- Get your head in the game!

01:01:32.064 --> 01:01:34.901
Go, Wildcats!

01:01:34.984 --> 01:01:36.986
<i>Everybody say it now</i>

01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:41.115
<i>Wildcats everywhere
Wave your hands up in the air</i>

01:01:41.199 --> 01:01:43.659
<i>That's the way we do it
Let's get to it</i>

01:01:43.743 --> 01:01:45.328
<i>Time to show the world</i>

01:01:45.411 --> 01:01:49.415
<i>Wildcats sing along
Yeah, you really got it goin' on</i>

01:01:49.498 --> 01:01:53.419
<i>Wildcats in the house
Everybody say it now</i>

01:01:53.502 --> 01:01:56.923
Troy! Troy! Troy! Troy! Troy!

01:01:57.006 --> 01:02:00.259
Troy! Troy! Troy! Troy! Troy! Troy!

01:02:00.343 --> 01:02:04.472
<i>It's funny when you find yourself</i>

01:02:04.555 --> 01:02:08.517
<i>Looking from the outside</i>

01:02:08.601 --> 01:02:12.521
<i>I'm standing here but all I want</i>

01:02:12.605 --> 01:02:16.359
<i>Is to be over there</i>

01:02:16.442 --> 01:02:20.696
<i>Why did I let myself believe</i>

01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:24.408
<i>Miracles could happen?</i>

01:02:24.492 --> 01:02:28.579
<i>'Cause now I have to pretend</i>

01:02:28.663 --> 01:02:32.375
<i>That I don't really care</i>

01:02:32.458 --> 01:02:36.712
<i>I thought you were my fairy tale</i>

01:02:36.796 --> 01:02:40.549
<i>A dream when I'm not sleeping</i>

01:02:40.633 --> 01:02:48.099
<i>A wish upon a star that's coming true</i>

01:02:48.182 --> 01:02:52.395
<i>But everybody else could tell</i>

01:02:52.478 --> 01:02:58.651
<i>That I confused my feelings with the truth</i>

01:02:58.734 --> 01:03:03.114
<i>When there was me and you</i>

01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:08.786
<i>I swore I knew the melody</i>

01:03:08.869 --> 01:03:12.540
<i>That I heard you singing</i>

01:03:12.623 --> 01:03:16.460
<i>And when you smiled you made me feel</i>

01:03:16.544 --> 01:03:20.339
<i>Like I could sing along</i>

01:03:20.423 --> 01:03:24.802
<i>But then you went
and changed the words</i>

01:03:24.885 --> 01:03:28.639
<i>Now my heart is empty</i>

01:03:28.723 --> 01:03:32.643
<i>I'm only left with used-to-bes</i>

01:03:32.727 --> 01:03:35.604
<i>And once upon a song</i>

01:03:36.147 --> 01:03:40.526
<i>Now I know you're not a fairy tale</i>

01:03:40.609 --> 01:03:44.739
<i>And dreams were meant for sleeping</i>

01:03:44.822 --> 01:03:47.366
<i>And wishes on a star</i>

01:03:47.450 --> 01:03:52.204
<i>Just don't come true</i>

01:03:52.288 --> 01:03:56.584
<i>'Cause now even I can tell</i>

01:03:56.667 --> 01:04:02.673
<i>That I confused my feelings with the truth</i>

01:04:02.757 --> 01:04:06.677
<i>Because I liked the view</i>

01:04:06.761 --> 01:04:10.556
<i>When there was me and you</i>

01:04:10.639 --> 01:04:15.644
<i>I can't believe that I could be so blind</i>

01:04:15.728 --> 01:04:19.648
<i>It's like you were floating
while I was falling</i>

01:04:19.732 --> 01:04:24.904
<i>And I didn't mind</i>

01:04:30.659 --> 01:04:34.580
<i>Because I liked the view</i>

01:04:38.793 --> 01:04:42.380
<i>I thought you felt it too</i>

01:04:42.463 --> 01:04:48.844
<i>When there was me and you</i>

01:05:00.106 --> 01:05:02.983
Hey. How you doin'?

01:05:03.484 --> 01:05:05.361
Listen. There's something
I wanna talk to you about.

01:05:05.444 --> 01:05:09.240
And here it is - I know what it's like
to carry a load with your friends.

01:05:09.323 --> 01:05:13.619
I get it. You've got your boys, Troy.
It's OK. So we're good.

01:05:13.702 --> 01:05:16.414
Good about what? I was gonna
talk to you about the final callbacks.

01:05:16.497 --> 01:05:19.333
I don't wanna do the callbacks either.

01:05:19.417 --> 01:05:23.129
Who are we trying to kid?
You've got your team and now I've got mine.

01:05:23.212 --> 01:05:27.049
I'll do the scholastic decathlon
and you'll win the championships.

01:05:27.133 --> 01:05:29.802
It's where we belong.

01:05:29.885 --> 01:05:32.263
- Go Wildcats.
- But I...

01:05:32.346 --> 01:05:34.432
Me neither.

01:05:36.976 --> 01:05:38.727
Gabriella?

01:05:40.813 --> 01:05:43.023
Go Wildcats!

01:05:44.608 --> 01:05:47.445
Hey, Captain.

01:05:52.241 --> 01:05:53.284
Okay.

01:05:53.367 --> 01:05:55.619
- What's with Troy? - Hey. What happened?
- Don't worry about it.

01:06:48.714 --> 01:06:50.174
Hey.

01:07:01.936 --> 01:07:04.313
Troy! Hey.

01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:28.671
Hey...

01:07:29.463 --> 01:07:31.757
We just had another team meeting.

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.842
Oh. Wonderful.

01:07:33.926 --> 01:07:37.930
We had a team meeting about how
we haven't been acting like a team.

01:07:38.013 --> 01:07:40.224
I mean us, not you.

01:07:40.307 --> 01:07:43.561
- Look. About the singing thing...
- Look. Dude, I don't even wanna talk about it.

01:07:43.644 --> 01:07:48.315
We just want you to know that we're
gonna be there. Okay? Cheering for you.

01:07:48.399 --> 01:07:52.069
Yeah, if singing is something you wanna do, we
should be boosting you up, not tearing you down.

01:07:52.152 --> 01:07:54.697
Yeah. I mean, win or lose,
we're teammates.

01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:59.159
Okay? That's what we're about. Even if you
turn out to be the worst singer in the world.

01:07:59.243 --> 01:08:02.121
Which, you know, we don't know,
because we haven't actually heard you sing.

01:08:02.204 --> 01:08:04.623
And you're not gonna hear me sing, guys.

01:08:04.707 --> 01:08:08.294
Because Gabriella won't even talk to me,

01:08:08.377 --> 01:08:10.921
and I don't know why.

01:08:13.632 --> 01:08:16.385
We do.

01:08:16.468 --> 01:08:18.178
I baked these fresh today.

01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:22.182
You'll probably want to try one
before we tell you the rest.

01:08:22.265 --> 01:08:24.727
Gabriella, we were jerks.

01:08:24.810 --> 01:08:28.147
No, we were worse than jerks
because we were mean jerks.

01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:31.149
We thought that Troy and the whole
singing thing was killing our chances

01:08:31.233 --> 01:08:33.234
of having you on
the scholastic decathlon team.

01:08:33.319 --> 01:08:36.113
I heard what he had to say.
I'm on your team now. Done.

01:08:36.196 --> 01:08:38.782
No, not done.

01:08:38.866 --> 01:08:44.455
We knew that Chad could get Troy to say things
to make you wanna forget about the callbacks.

01:08:44.537 --> 01:08:47.124
We planned it.
And we're embarrassed and sorry.

01:08:47.207 --> 01:08:51.502
No one forced Troy to say anything.
And you know what? It's OK.

01:08:51.587 --> 01:08:54.548
We should be preparing for
the decathlon now, so it's time to move on.

01:08:54.631 --> 01:08:57.216
No, it's not OK.

01:08:57.301 --> 01:09:03.599
The decathlon is whatever, but how you
feel about us, and even more, Troy -

01:09:03.682 --> 01:09:06.810
that's what really matters.

01:09:14.234 --> 01:09:17.071
We tried.

01:09:33.879 --> 01:09:37.508
Hi.Just came to say I'm sorry.

01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:43.764
- Hi, Mrs Montez, I'm Troy Bolton.
- Troy!

01:09:45.683 --> 01:09:52.272
Gabriella is kind of busy with homework
and such, so now's not really a good time.

01:09:52.356 --> 01:09:58.654
I made a mistake, Mrs Montez, and I
would really like to let Gabriella know that.

01:09:58.737 --> 01:10:01.573
Could you tell her that I came by to see her?

01:10:01.657 --> 01:10:04.243
I will, Troy.

01:10:05.577 --> 01:10:08.706
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight. Thank you.

01:10:38.694 --> 01:10:41.739
- Hello? - What you heard the
other day, none of that is true.

01:10:41.822 --> 01:10:43.866
I was sick of my friends
riding me about singing with you,

01:10:43.949 --> 01:10:46.702
so I said things I knew would shut them up.
I didn't mean any of it.

01:10:46.785 --> 01:10:49.371
You sounded pretty convincing to me.

01:10:49.455 --> 01:10:54.418
Listen. The guy you met on vacation is way more
me than the guy who said those stupid things.

01:10:54.501 --> 01:10:56.962
Troy, the whole singing thing is making
the school wack.

01:10:57.045 --> 01:11:00.549
You said so yourself. Everyone's
treating you differently because of it.

01:11:00.632 --> 01:11:03.552
Maybe that's because I don't wanna
only be the basketball guy any more.

01:11:03.635 --> 01:11:07.973
They can't handle it.
That's not my problem, it's theirs.

01:11:08.056 --> 01:11:11.018
- How about your dad?
- And it's not about my dad.

01:11:11.101 --> 01:11:15.272
This is about how I feel,
and I'm not letting the team down.

01:11:15.355 --> 01:11:21.278
They let me down.
So I'm gonna sing. What about you?

01:11:21.361 --> 01:11:23.655
I don't know, Troy.

01:11:23.739 --> 01:11:28.869
Well, you need to say yes.
Because I brought you something.

01:11:28.952 --> 01:11:31.455
What do you mean?

01:11:31.538 --> 01:11:33.624
Turn around.

01:11:44.176 --> 01:11:50.265
<i>This could be the start of something new</i>

01:11:50.349 --> 01:11:55.229
<i>It feels so right to be here with you</i>

01:11:57.731 --> 01:12:02.236
<i>And now, lookin' in your eyes</i>

01:12:02.319 --> 01:12:06.824
<i>I feel in my heart</i>

01:12:06.907 --> 01:12:09.743
<i>The start of something...</i>

01:12:10.744 --> 01:12:12.830
new.

01:12:15.624 --> 01:12:18.293
It's a pairs audition.

01:12:52.035 --> 01:12:53.704
Yeah!

01:12:53.787 --> 01:12:57.708
Zn4, and by doing that,
you end up with two, and two.

01:12:58.834 --> 01:13:00.919
Got it?

01:13:01.712 --> 01:13:03.630
Yes!

01:13:06.592 --> 01:13:08.927
What's happening?

01:13:18.437 --> 01:13:21.023
Guys, come here.
Go ahead and put five grams of this in.

01:13:21.106 --> 01:13:23.525
And that causes it to change
from an acidic state,

01:13:23.609 --> 01:13:26.320
causing the colour
to change from pink to blue.

01:13:26.403 --> 01:13:28.697
Just like those pH test strips.

01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:31.742
Gotta go.
See you guys later!

01:13:47.174 --> 01:13:49.217
You're late.

01:13:49.301 --> 01:13:53.597
<i>...strength to believe</i>

01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:55.724
<i>We're soarin'</i>

01:13:55.807 --> 01:13:58.352
<i>Flyin'</i>

01:13:58.435 --> 01:14:00.020
<i>There's not a star in...</i>

01:14:04.358 --> 01:14:06.568
<i>If we're tryin'</i>

01:14:06.652 --> 01:14:08.320
<i>Yeah, we're breakin' free</i>

01:14:09.613 --> 01:14:11.531
Wow.

01:14:11.615 --> 01:14:14.201
They sound good.

01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:19.957
<i>Like a wave the ocean just...</i>

01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:22.250
We have to do something.

01:14:22.334 --> 01:14:24.211
OK. Our callback is on Thursday,

01:14:24.294 --> 01:14:28.966
and the basketball game
and scholastic decathlon are on Friday.

01:14:29.049 --> 01:14:32.135
Too bad all these events weren't
happening on the same day,

01:14:32.219 --> 01:14:34.721
at the same time.

01:14:35.555 --> 01:14:40.560
Well, that wouldn't work out because then
Troy and Gabriella wouldn't be able to make...

01:14:43.021 --> 01:14:45.315
I'm proud to call you my sister.

01:14:45.399 --> 01:14:47.484
I know.

01:14:48.568 --> 01:14:52.197
I don't want to hear any more
about Troy Bolton and that Montez girl.

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:56.326
So, if you're telling me
as copresidents of the drama club

01:14:56.410 --> 01:14:59.746
that changing the callbacks would be
what's best for our theatre programme,

01:14:59.830 --> 01:15:02.791
then I might actually agree with you.

01:15:10.215 --> 01:15:11.758
Is that a yes?

01:15:13.927 --> 01:15:15.595
<i>Bop bop bop, bop to the top</i>

01:15:15.679 --> 01:15:17.597
<i>And wipe away your inhibitions</i>

01:15:17.681 --> 01:15:21.309
<i>Stump stump stump, do the rump
And strut your stuff</i>

01:15:21.393 --> 01:15:23.270
<i>Bop bop bop, straight to the top</i>

01:15:23.353 --> 01:15:25.522
<i>Going for the glory</i>

01:15:34.448 --> 01:15:37.993
No problem at all.
It was crazy, man.

01:15:38.952 --> 01:15:42.622
- Callbacks the same time as the game?
- And the scholastic decathlon.

01:15:42.706 --> 01:15:45.125
- Why would they do that?
- I smell a rat named Darbus.

01:15:45.208 --> 01:15:47.878
Actually, I think it's two rats,
neither of them named Darbus.

01:15:47.961 --> 01:15:51.089
Do you know something about this,
small person?

01:15:51.173 --> 01:15:53.258
Ms Darbus might think
that she's protecting the show,

01:15:53.341 --> 01:15:56.595
but Ryan and Sharpay are pretty much
only concerned with protecting themselves.

01:15:56.678 --> 01:15:58.555
Do you know what I'm gonna do
to those two show dogs?

01:15:58.638 --> 01:16:02.934
Nothing. We're not gonna do anything
to them. Except sing, maybe.

01:16:03.018 --> 01:16:05.812
All right. Now, this is only gonna happen
if we all work together.

01:16:05.896 --> 01:16:09.649
- Now, who's in?
- You know I'm in.

01:16:28.710 --> 01:16:30.837
A pi pie.

01:16:30.921 --> 01:16:32.923
My goodness!

01:16:33.006 --> 01:16:35.634
What? Thank you!

01:16:36.093 --> 01:16:40.180
- We have something for you too.
- Yeah, come here, look.

01:16:42.307 --> 01:16:45.185
It's an equation.

01:17:03.245 --> 01:17:05.288
Stay right there. Watch.

01:17:05.372 --> 01:17:07.249
From our team, to yours.

01:17:07.332 --> 01:17:08.416
G-o

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.585
d-r-a-m-a

01:17:10.669 --> 01:17:13.421
c-l-u-b.
Exclamation point.

01:17:13.505 --> 01:17:19.052
Well, seems we Wildcats are in
for an interesting afternoon.

01:17:19.136 --> 01:17:22.139
- Go. Go.
- G-o-d...

01:17:22.222 --> 01:17:24.224
Godra... Godra...

01:17:24.307 --> 01:17:26.434
Godray...?

01:17:26.518 --> 01:17:28.603
Drame?

01:17:53.003 --> 01:17:56.047
How you feeling?

01:17:56.131 --> 01:17:59.009
- Nervous.
- Yeah, me too.

01:17:59.092 --> 01:18:03.889
- Wish I could suit up and play alongside of you.
- Hey, you had your turn.

01:18:06.016 --> 01:18:08.143
You know what I want from you today?

01:18:08.226 --> 01:18:10.979
- The championship.
- That'll come or it won't.

01:18:11.062 --> 01:18:14.441
What I want is for you to have fun.

01:18:14.524 --> 01:18:19.237
I know all about the pressure, and probably
too much of it has come from me.

01:18:19.321 --> 01:18:23.200
'Cause what I really want is to see my son

01:18:23.283 --> 01:18:27.204
having the time of his life
playing the game we both love.

01:18:29.122 --> 01:18:34.085
You give me that, and I will sleep with a smile
on my face no matter how the score comes out.

01:18:38.673 --> 01:18:41.509
Thanks, Coach.

01:18:41.593 --> 01:18:43.511
Dad.

01:18:57.567 --> 01:19:00.570
Welcome to
the tenth annual Scholastic Decathlon.

01:19:00.654 --> 01:19:04.824
East High Wildcats
versus West High Knights.

01:19:07.661 --> 01:19:11.373
Hello! Right here, right here. Yes.

01:19:24.344 --> 01:19:26.221
Stop!

01:19:29.057 --> 01:19:31.142
- I trust you.
- Energy.

01:19:42.195 --> 01:19:46.449
And now, introducing
your East High Wildcats!

01:19:46.533 --> 01:19:48.576
Let's go! Go!

01:19:48.660 --> 01:19:54.457
...for this championship game between
East High and West High. This is sure to be...

01:20:02.799 --> 01:20:07.512
Casting the leads of a show is both
a challenge and a responsibility.

01:20:07.595 --> 01:20:09.681
A joy and a burden.

01:20:09.764 --> 01:20:13.059
I commend you and all other young artists

01:20:13.143 --> 01:20:17.689
who hold out for the moon,
the sun and the stars.

01:20:20.025 --> 01:20:23.236
Shall we soar together?

01:20:25.155 --> 01:20:27.157
Sharpay and Ryan.

01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:49.054
<i>I believe in dreamin',
shootin ' for the stars</i>

01:20:49.137 --> 01:20:53.600
<i>Baby, to be number one
you've got to raise the bar</i>

01:20:53.683 --> 01:20:57.562
<i>Kickin' and a-scratchin',
grindin' out my best</i>

01:20:57.645 --> 01:21:01.691
<i>Anything it takes to climb
the ladder of success</i>

01:21:01.775 --> 01:21:05.070
<i>Work our tails off every day</i>

01:21:06.279 --> 01:21:10.033
<i>Gotta bump the competition
Blow them all away</i>

01:21:13.495 --> 01:21:14.537
<i>Yeah, we're gonna</i>

01:21:14.621 --> 01:21:16.331
<i>Bop bop bop, bop to the top</i>

01:21:16.414 --> 01:21:18.541
<i>Slip and slide and ride that rhythm</i>

01:21:18.625 --> 01:21:20.293
<i>Jump and hop, hop till we drop</i>

01:21:20.377 --> 01:21:22.962
<i>And start again</i>

01:21:23.046 --> 01:21:24.964
<i>Zip zap zop, pop like a mop</i>

01:21:25.048 --> 01:21:26.758
<i>Scoot around the corner</i>

01:21:26.841 --> 01:21:30.387
<i>Move it to the groove
till the music stops</i>

01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:33.348
<i>Do the bop bop, bop to the top</i>

01:21:33.431 --> 01:21:35.183
<i>Don't ever stop</i>

01:21:35.266 --> 01:21:37.560
<i>Bop to the top</i>

01:21:37.644 --> 01:21:39.521
<i>Gimme, gimme, shimmy, shimmy</i>

01:21:39.604 --> 01:21:41.689
Wildcats!

01:21:42.732 --> 01:21:46.486
...for the coveted championship trophy!

01:21:51.991 --> 01:21:55.829
East High wins the opening tip,
pushing the ball up the court.

01:22:14.264 --> 01:22:16.224
East High.

01:22:16.641 --> 01:22:19.269
We did it!

01:22:19.352 --> 01:22:20.645
Great job.

01:22:20.728 --> 01:22:24.899
<i>Shake some booty and turn around</i>

01:22:24.983 --> 01:22:26.943
<i>Flash a smile in their direction</i>

01:22:27.026 --> 01:22:30.196
<i>- Show some muscle
- Do the hustle</i>

01:22:36.536 --> 01:22:41.458
All right, Wildcats,
time for an orderly exit from the gym.

01:22:59.392 --> 01:23:04.189
And West High pushes the ball around
the perimeter on the offensive end.

01:23:04.272 --> 01:23:06.858
Nice ball movement by West High.

01:23:06.941 --> 01:23:08.651
Driving the lane.

01:23:08.735 --> 01:23:11.571
Shot is up and...

01:23:13.573 --> 01:23:17.911
We seem to be experiencing
some technical difficulties.

01:23:18.828 --> 01:23:20.663
We've got a timeout on the court.

01:23:20.747 --> 01:23:23.082
We have a problem.
Stop the game. Stop the game.

01:23:23.166 --> 01:23:26.002
The referee has signalled timeout.

01:23:27.462 --> 01:23:29.881
Everyone please remain calm.

01:23:42.477 --> 01:23:44.562
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:23:46.856 --> 01:23:52.320
I'm sure we'll get this figured out real soon.
In the meantime, for safety regulations,

01:23:52.403 --> 01:23:55.865
we need to all make an orderly exit
from the gym, please.

01:23:55.949 --> 01:23:57.784
Thank you.

01:23:57.867 --> 01:23:59.160
<i>Yeah, we're gonna</i>

01:23:59.244 --> 01:24:00.787
<i>Bop bop bop, bop to the top</i>

01:24:00.870 --> 01:24:03.331
<i>Wipe away your inhibitions</i>

01:24:03.414 --> 01:24:07.377
<i>Stump stump stump, do the rump
And strut your stuff</i>

01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:09.587
<i>Bop bop bop, straight to the top</i>

01:24:09.671 --> 01:24:11.256
<i>Going for the glory</i>

01:24:11.339 --> 01:24:14.259
<i>We'll keep stepping up
and we just won't stop</i>

01:24:14.342 --> 01:24:16.594
<i>Stop</i>

01:24:17.095 --> 01:24:19.847
<i>Till we reach the top</i>

01:24:19.931 --> 01:24:22.016
<i>Bop to the top</i>

01:24:34.028 --> 01:24:35.655
Hi! Call me.

01:24:38.366 --> 01:24:42.495
Do you see why we love
the theatre, people?

01:24:42.579 --> 01:24:44.664
Well done!

01:24:45.373 --> 01:24:47.709
Troy Bolton, Gabriella Montez.

01:24:49.210 --> 01:24:51.754
- Troy? Gabriella?
- They'll be here.

01:24:51.838 --> 01:24:57.385
The theatre, as I have often pointed out,
waits for no one. I'm sorry.

01:24:58.511 --> 01:25:00.346
Well, we are done here.

01:25:00.430 --> 01:25:04.058
Congratulations to all.
The cast list will be posted.

01:25:04.517 --> 01:25:06.477
No, wait! Wait, Ms Darbus! Wait!

01:25:06.561 --> 01:25:10.148
- We're ready, we can sing.
- I called your names, twice.

01:25:10.231 --> 01:25:14.110
- Ms Darbus, please. Please.
- Rules are rules.

01:25:18.239 --> 01:25:21.034
We'll be happy to do it again for
our fellow students, Ms Darbus.

01:25:21.117 --> 01:25:24.078
I don't know what's going on here,

01:25:24.162 --> 01:25:28.041
but in any event, it's far too late
and we have not got a pianist.

01:25:28.124 --> 01:25:31.085
- Well, that's showbiz.
- We'll sing without a piano.

01:25:31.169 --> 01:25:33.838
No, you won't.
Pianist here, Ms Darbus.

01:25:33.921 --> 01:25:37.258
- You really don't wanna do that.
- Yes, I really do.

01:25:37.342 --> 01:25:39.344
Ready on stage.

01:25:39.427 --> 01:25:42.138
Now, that's showbiz.

01:26:11.334 --> 01:26:14.295
I can't do it, Troy,
not with all these people staring at me.

01:26:14.379 --> 01:26:18.508
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.
Look at me, right at me. Right at me.

01:26:18.591 --> 01:26:22.220
Like the first time we sang together.
Remember?

01:26:22.887 --> 01:26:24.764
Like kindergarten.

01:26:36.401 --> 01:26:38.736
<i>We're soarin'</i>

01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:41.239
<i>Flyin'</i>

01:26:41.322 --> 01:26:47.161
<i>There's not a star in heaven
that we can't reach</i>

01:26:47.245 --> 01:26:49.205
<i>If we're tryin'</i>

01:26:49.288 --> 01:26:52.417
<i>So we're breakin' free</i>

01:26:55.002 --> 01:26:59.382
<i>You know the world can see us</i>

01:26:59.465 --> 01:27:03.761
<i>In a way that's different than who we are</i>

01:27:03.845 --> 01:27:07.390
<i>Creating space between us</i>

01:27:07.473 --> 01:27:09.934
<i>Till we're separate hearts</i>

01:27:12.478 --> 01:27:16.482
<i>But your faith, it gives me strength</i>

01:27:16.566 --> 01:27:20.153
<i>Strength to believe</i>

01:27:20.236 --> 01:27:23.322
<i>- We're breakin' free
- We're soarin'</i>

01:27:23.406 --> 01:27:25.700
<i>Flyin'</i>

01:27:25.783 --> 01:27:30.913
<i>There's not a star in heaven
that we can't reach</i>

01:27:31.497 --> 01:27:33.666
<i>If we're tryin'</i>

01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:35.960
<i>Yeah, we're breakin' free</i>

01:27:36.043 --> 01:27:39.672
<i>We're breakin ' free</i>

01:27:39.756 --> 01:27:43.843
<i>Can you feel it building</i>

01:27:43.926 --> 01:27:48.306
<i>Like a wave the ocean just can't control?</i>

01:27:48.389 --> 01:27:50.892
<i>Connected by a feeling</i>

01:27:50.975 --> 01:27:53.436
<i>In our very soul</i>

01:27:53.519 --> 01:27:55.229
<i>Very soul</i>

01:27:57.023 --> 01:28:00.902
<i>Rising till it lifts us up</i>

01:28:00.985 --> 01:28:04.322
<i>So everyone can see</i>

01:28:04.405 --> 01:28:07.492
<i>- We're breakin' free
- We're soarin'</i>

01:28:07.575 --> 01:28:10.036
<i>Flyin'</i>

01:28:10.119 --> 01:28:16.000
<i>There's not a star in heaven
that we can't reach</i>

01:28:16.083 --> 01:28:18.127
<i>If we're tryin'</i>

01:28:18.211 --> 01:28:20.463
<i>Yeah, we're breakin' free</i>

01:28:20.546 --> 01:28:23.758
<i>We're breakin ' free</i>

01:28:23.841 --> 01:28:27.887
<i>- Runnin'
- Climbin'</i>

01:28:27.970 --> 01:28:33.100
<i>To get to that place
to be all that we can be</i>

01:28:33.768 --> 01:28:35.853
<i>Now's the time</i>

01:28:35.937 --> 01:28:38.606
<i>So we're breakin' free</i>

01:28:38.689 --> 01:28:41.484
<i>- We're breakin' free
- Ooh, yeah</i>

01:28:41.567 --> 01:28:43.694
<i>More than hope, more than faith</i>

01:28:43.778 --> 01:28:45.655
<i>This is truth, this is fate</i>

01:28:45.738 --> 01:28:50.535
<i>And together we see it comin'</i>

01:28:50.618 --> 01:28:52.703
<i>More than you, more than me</i>

01:28:52.787 --> 01:28:54.705
<i>Not a want, but a need</i>

01:28:54.789 --> 01:28:59.043
<i>Both of us breakin' free</i>

01:28:59.126 --> 01:29:00.962
<i>Soarin'</i>

01:29:01.045 --> 01:29:03.548
<i>Flyin'</i>

01:29:03.631 --> 01:29:09.428
<i>There's not a star in heaven
that we can't reach</i>

01:29:09.512 --> 01:29:11.639
<i>If we're tryin'</i>

01:29:11.722 --> 01:29:13.224
<i>Yeah, we're breakin' free</i>

01:29:13.307 --> 01:29:15.476
<i>Breakin' free</i>

01:29:16.561 --> 01:29:18.187
<i>We're runnin'</i>

01:29:18.271 --> 01:29:21.107
<i>Climbin'</i>

01:29:21.190 --> 01:29:27.196
<i>To get to that place
to be all that we can be</i>

01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:29.991
<i>- Now's the time
- Now's the time</i>

01:29:30.074 --> 01:29:33.244
<i>- We're breakin' free
- We're breakin' free</i>

01:29:35.121 --> 01:29:39.750
<i>You know the world can see us</i>

01:29:39.834 --> 01:29:47.758
<i>In a way that's different than who we are</i>

01:30:02.481 --> 01:30:06.068
- That's amazing!
- Amazing, yeah!

01:30:15.786 --> 01:30:17.830
And West High pushin' the ball.

01:30:17.955 --> 01:30:20.249
Fast break.
Looking for an open man.

01:30:20.333 --> 01:30:24.253
But it's stolen by number 14,
headed back the other way!

01:30:24.337 --> 01:30:27.882
East High has the ball!
Time is running down on the clock!

01:30:28.716 --> 01:30:30.885
Looking for an open man.

01:30:30.968 --> 01:30:34.138
Fake. Swing to the outside.
Ball on the perimeter.

01:30:34.221 --> 01:30:36.641
Looks for a man on the inside.
Nice screen.

01:30:36.724 --> 01:30:38.267
Shot's up.

01:30:38.351 --> 01:30:43.731
And it's good! A 12-foot jump shot
as time expires for the victory!

01:30:43.814 --> 01:30:46.734
East High has won the championship!

01:30:46.817 --> 01:30:50.196
Your East High Wildcats are champions!

01:30:50.279 --> 01:30:52.239
Congratulations, East High!

01:30:52.323 --> 01:30:54.825
Troy! Troy! Troy! Troy! Troy!

01:30:54.909 --> 01:30:57.244
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

01:30:57.328 --> 01:31:00.581
Coming through! Coming through!
Coming through!

01:31:02.792 --> 01:31:04.210
- What team?
- Wildcats!

01:31:04.418 --> 01:31:05.920
- What team?
- Wildcats!

01:31:06.128 --> 01:31:07.296
- What team?
- Wildcats!

01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:09.298
- Wildcats!
- Get your head in the game!

01:31:09.382 --> 01:31:12.051
- Yeah!
- Yeah, bro!

01:31:12.134 --> 01:31:14.679
- I'm proud of you, son.
- Thanks, Dad.

01:31:14.762 --> 01:31:15.846
Bravo!

01:31:15.930 --> 01:31:17.598
Brava!

01:31:17.682 --> 01:31:19.475
- Troy, you're the man!
- No, you!

01:31:19.558 --> 01:31:22.019
- Congratulations, Wildcat!
- What about your team?

01:31:22.103 --> 01:31:24.271
We won too!

01:31:24.355 --> 01:31:26.482
Yo. Team voted you
the game ball, Captain.

01:31:26.565 --> 01:31:29.568
Yeah, thank you.
Thanks a lot. Yeah.

01:31:29.652 --> 01:31:32.279
So, you're going with me
to the after-party, right?

01:31:32.363 --> 01:31:35.491
- Like on a date?
- Must be your lucky day.

01:31:36.534 --> 01:31:39.036
Chad just asked me out.

01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:41.914
Well, congratulations.
I guess I'm going to be the understudy

01:31:41.998 --> 01:31:46.419
in case you can't make one of the shows,
so... break a leg.

01:31:46.502 --> 01:31:49.547
In theatre that means good luck.

01:31:49.630 --> 01:31:53.884
Hey, Sharpay. I'm sorry you didn't get
the lead, but I think that you're really good.

01:31:53.968 --> 01:31:57.930
- I admire you so much.
- And why wouldn't you? Now, bye-bye.

01:31:58.014 --> 01:32:01.350
Wait. I baked you some cookies.

01:32:01.434 --> 01:32:03.394
- Nice game.
- Thanks.

01:32:04.437 --> 01:32:08.733
Composer, here's your game ball.
You deserve it, playmaker.

01:32:10.609 --> 01:32:12.611
Yeah!

01:32:27.877 --> 01:32:28.878
Here we go!

01:32:28.961 --> 01:32:31.130
<i>Together, together</i>

01:32:31.213 --> 01:32:33.215
<i>Together, everyone</i>

01:32:33.299 --> 01:32:35.217
<i>Together, together</i>

01:32:35.301 --> 01:32:37.595
<i>Come on, let's have some fun</i>

01:32:37.678 --> 01:32:41.515
<i>Together, we're there for
each other every time</i>

01:32:41.599 --> 01:32:43.559

01:32:45.978 --> 01:32:49.732
<i>Here and now it's time for celebration</i>

01:32:49.815 --> 01:32:52.693
<i>I finally figured out</i>

01:32:52.777 --> 01:32:53.986
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

01:32:54.070 --> 01:32:57.990
<i>That all our dreams have no limitations</i>

01:32:58.074 --> 01:33:01.118
<i>That's what it's all about</i>

01:33:01.202 --> 01:33:02.495
<i>Come on, now</i>

01:33:02.578 --> 01:33:06.499
<i>Everyone is special in their own way</i>

01:33:06.582 --> 01:33:09.001
<i>We make each other strong</i>

01:33:09.085 --> 01:33:10.586
<i>Each other strong</i>

01:33:10.669 --> 01:33:12.088
<i>We're not the same</i>

01:33:12.171 --> 01:33:14.548
<i>We're different in a good way</i>

01:33:14.632 --> 01:33:18.385
<i>Together's where we belong</i>

01:33:18.469 --> 01:33:21.305
<i>We're all in this together</i>

01:33:21.388 --> 01:33:26.435
<i>Once we know that we are,
we're all stars, and we see that</i>

01:33:26.519 --> 01:33:29.730
<i>We're all in this together</i>

01:33:29.814 --> 01:33:33.275
<i>And it shows
when we stand hand in hand</i>

01:33:33.359 --> 01:33:36.237
<i>Make our dreams come true</i>

01:33:38.656 --> 01:33:39.490
<i>Everybody now</i>

01:33:39.573 --> 01:33:41.534
<i>Together, together</i>

01:33:41.617 --> 01:33:43.702
<i>Together, everyone</i>

01:33:43.786 --> 01:33:45.621
<i>Together, together</i>

01:33:45.704 --> 01:33:47.790
<i>Come on, let's have some fun</i>

01:33:47.873 --> 01:33:51.752
<i>Together, we're there for
each other every time</i>

01:33:51.836 --> 01:33:53.879
<i>Together, together</i>

01:33:53.963 --> 01:33:56.048
<i>Come on, let's do this right</i>

01:33:56.132 --> 01:34:00.094
<i>We're all here and speaking out
with one voice</i>

01:34:00.177 --> 01:34:03.055
<i>We're gonna rock the house</i>

01:34:03.139 --> 01:34:04.473
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

01:34:04.557 --> 01:34:08.602
<i>The party's on,
now everybody make some noise</i>

01:34:08.686 --> 01:34:11.939
<i>Come on, scream and shout</i>

01:34:12.690 --> 01:34:14.233
<i>We've arrived</i>

01:34:14.316 --> 01:34:16.527
<i>Because we stuck together</i>

01:34:17.069 --> 01:34:20.489
<i>Champions one and all</i>

01:34:20.573 --> 01:34:23.617
<i>We're all in this together</i>

01:34:23.701 --> 01:34:28.581

<i>Make our dreams come</i>

01:34:37.047 --> 01:34:40.176
<i>We're all in this together</i>

01:34:40.259 --> 01:34:42.511
<i>When we reach, we can fly</i>

01:34:42.595 --> 01:34:45.347
<i>Know inside we can make it</i>

01:34:45.431 --> 01:34:48.225
<i>We're all in this together</i>

01:34:48.309 --> 01:34:53.856
<i>Once we see there's a chance
that we have and we take it</i>

01:34:53.939 --> 01:34:55.608
<i>Wildcats sing along</i>

01:34:55.691 --> 01:34:58.027

Everybody say it now</i>

<i>Wildcats everywhere
Wave your hands up in the air</i>

01:35:06.243 --> 01:35:08.954
<i>That's the way we do it
Let's get to it</i>

01:35:09.038 --> 01:35:10.289

These cookies are genius!

01:37:29.178 --> 01:37:33.140
The best things I've ever tasted.
Will you make some more for me, Zeke?

01:37:38.437 --> 01:37:41.190
I might even make you a crème brûlée.
