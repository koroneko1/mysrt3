00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.075
Mister.

00:00:23.715 --> 00:00:25.337
It won’t be complicated, right?

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.880
What happens tonight ends tonight.

00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:32.173
I’m not sure about that.

00:00:32.588 --> 00:00:34.186
You don’t want to know me that much?

00:00:34.613 --> 00:00:36.211
I think it’s better for us this way.

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:38.527
Here’s your Chic… Oh shit!

00:00:41.456 --> 00:00:43.315
I don’t understand.

00:00:43.315 --> 00:00:44.489
I can’t read sign language.

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.053
I said I didn’t do it.

00:00:46.428 --> 00:00:49.280
Your son was startled when he saw me and dropped the bottle.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.893
Hey. How could you put the blame on my son?

00:00:51.893 --> 00:00:53.243
I let you pay us in installments.

00:00:53.361 --> 00:00:55.361
Can I work for you instead?

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:00.468
What if I want to apply to be your waitstaff?

00:01:00.826 --> 00:01:03.830
From now on, we are no strangers.

00:01:04.361 --> 00:01:07.050
What should I call you, Boss?

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.771
Jim.

00:01:09.449 --> 00:01:11.800
But people call me Uncle Jim.

00:01:23.226 --> 00:01:25.025
Uncle Jim, have you eaten?

00:01:25.025 --> 00:01:27.000
Here’s Fermented Soy Bean Dip that Praew made.

00:01:27.216 --> 00:01:29.216
Put it over there. I’ll eat it later.

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.885
Eat before it goes bad.

00:01:30.885 --> 00:01:31.960
A-ha.

00:01:32.129 --> 00:01:36.000
How is Praew doing? What’s her work shift today?

00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:38.712
Night shift until 10.

00:01:38.712 --> 00:01:41.547
She said she can’t stand for long and wanted comfy shoes.

00:01:45.828 --> 00:01:48.832
[Wen: I’ve arrived. Should I just go in?]

00:01:57.562 --> 00:02:00.000
Take her shoe shopping then.

00:02:04.087 --> 00:02:05.771
How can I?

00:02:06.197 --> 00:02:07.412
Li Ming isn’t here.

00:02:07.728 --> 00:02:09.144
Can you run the diner alone?

00:02:09.902 --> 00:02:11.020
You can go.

00:02:11.393 --> 00:02:12.640
I’ve got an extra pair of hands.

00:02:12.924 --> 00:02:13.866
Gaipa?

00:02:19.778 --> 00:02:20.836
Ahem.

00:02:26.066 --> 00:02:28.066
Ah, you came for the card that you forgot?

00:02:28.146 --> 00:02:29.257
Let me grab it for you.

00:02:29.257 --> 00:02:30.146
Don’t.

00:02:32.987 --> 00:02:34.987
This is Wen, my friend.

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:37.548
He’s helping out.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.508
Ah.

00:02:41.508 --> 00:02:42.863
The other day, he passed out drunk.

00:02:43.326 --> 00:02:44.446
Today, he got a job here.

00:02:46.168 --> 00:02:48.000
I wasn’t drunk in vain, was I?

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.799
That’s great then.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.975
Thank you for helping.

00:02:56.643 --> 00:02:57.602
Bye, Uncle.

00:02:57.602 --> 00:02:58.471
Hey.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.267
Where should I start, Uncle Jim?

00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:21.125
Sure you can handle it?

00:03:21.125 --> 00:03:22.396
It’s tough.

00:03:23.257 --> 00:03:24.790
Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

00:03:26.852 --> 00:03:28.204
Don’t worry about me.

00:03:28.852 --> 00:03:32.198
When someone like me wants something,

00:03:34.116 --> 00:03:35.246
I work hard for it.

00:03:49.767 --> 00:03:50.637
Let's get started.

00:03:51.216 --> 00:03:52.412
I’m ready.

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:41.689
Chapter 2: The Temporary Chicken Rice

00:05:42.001 --> 00:05:42.871
Here.

00:05:45.138 --> 00:05:46.985
Ride home safe.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.982
Or if you want me to pick you up, let me know.

00:05:51.181 --> 00:05:54.000
By the way, I had a dream last night.

00:05:54.218 --> 00:05:55.260
I saw a silver necklace.

00:05:56.218 --> 00:05:57.176
A silver necklace?

00:05:57.176 --> 00:05:57.871
Yeah.

00:05:58.124 --> 00:06:01.588
I walked into the woods.

00:06:02.363 --> 00:06:04.704
I found it on a tree stump.

00:06:04.704 --> 00:06:05.855
Kind of.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.123
Let’s look it up.

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:13.215
It says here that more expenses are coming your way.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.758
If girls dream about it,

00:06:15.935 --> 00:06:17.397
they could be expecting a daughter.

00:06:17.761 --> 00:06:18.728
A daughter?

00:06:18.986 --> 00:06:21.023
How are a silver necklace and a daughter related?

00:06:21.624 --> 00:06:22.769
No.

00:06:23.113 --> 00:06:25.632
Can I get numbers instead?

00:06:25.632 --> 00:06:27.821
Give the exact numbers.

00:06:27.821 --> 00:06:28.709
Let me think.

00:06:29.325 --> 00:06:30.535
Necklace is ‘4.’

00:06:31.051 --> 00:06:32.271
There’s only one necklace, so it’s ‘1.’

00:06:32.567 --> 00:06:33.882
41 and 14.

00:06:33.882 --> 00:06:34.600
Go for it.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.721
Buy the lotto.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
It’s not like I dream about a necklace all the time.

00:06:38.371 --> 00:06:39.610
We might win.

00:06:40.557 --> 00:06:41.318
Hey.

00:06:41.318 --> 00:06:43.995
Police, arrest these two.

00:06:43.995 --> 00:06:45.361
They’re selling illegal lotto.

00:06:45.504 --> 00:06:47.458
Yeah, arrest me, officers.

00:06:47.632 --> 00:06:48.516
Where are the police?

00:06:48.516 --> 00:06:49.632
I don’t see any.

00:06:49.705 --> 00:06:51.935
I sell lotto to police wives.

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:54.000
I’m not scared, you asshole.

00:06:54.294 --> 00:06:55.950
No, thanks. I’m good.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:56.969
What are you doing here anyway?

00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:57.774
Are you cutting work?

00:06:57.774 --> 00:06:59.275
I’m not.

00:06:59.275 --> 00:07:00.803
I came to order LPG for Uncle Jim.

00:07:01.126 --> 00:07:02.696
I’m dropping off the bike for Praew too.

00:07:02.983 --> 00:07:04.032
About to head back.

00:07:04.032 --> 00:07:04.660
Coming with me?

00:07:04.982 --> 00:07:07.384
Oh? I thought I could use a ride home.

00:07:07.752 --> 00:07:09.299
You can walk with me. Okay?

00:07:10.016 --> 00:07:11.664
I’m taking off, babe.

00:07:12.158 --> 00:07:12.741
Bye.

00:07:12.741 --> 00:07:15.794
But, hey. Don’t forget to buy 14 and 41.

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:16.763
You got it.

00:07:17.174 --> 00:07:18.399
Why going home so early?

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:21.068
Aren’t you a senior? Don’t you have night school?

00:07:21.068 --> 00:07:22.133
Are you really going to school?

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.040
No, I’m just wearing a student cosplay.

00:07:25.566 --> 00:07:27.365
Which uni are you going to? Have you thought about it?

00:07:32.556 --> 00:07:33.867
[Registration to work overseas is now open.]

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.959
I haven’t.

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:39.020
What?

00:07:39.537 --> 00:07:40.584
What about you?

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.760
Uncle Jim told you to enroll in non-formal education, but you didn’t.

00:07:44.194 --> 00:07:46.567
I don’t want to study. I just want to get rich.

00:07:46.567 --> 00:07:48.000
I want to win the lotto.

00:07:49.377 --> 00:07:50.446
How’s that?

00:07:51.117 --> 00:07:52.715
You haven’t even paid me back the money you owed.

00:07:53.488 --> 00:07:55.488
Quit bringing the 100 baht up.

00:07:55.918 --> 00:07:57.918
It’s not like I owe you one million.

00:07:58.182 --> 00:08:00.000
I’ll pay you back once I win the lotto.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.913
You all right?

00:08:01.183 --> 00:08:02.352
I’m fine.

00:08:11.346 --> 00:08:12.550
This is Wen.

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:15.097
He’ll step in when you’re not here.

00:08:15.628 --> 00:08:16.515
Hello.

00:08:16.716 --> 00:08:17.657
Hi.

00:08:18.972 --> 00:08:21.316
Come on. Storing plates is easy.

00:08:21.972 --> 00:08:23.453
Learn to cook the rice with me back here.

00:08:24.457 --> 00:08:25.701
On my very first day?

00:08:25.701 --> 00:08:26.998
Yeah. Come on.

00:08:29.753 --> 00:08:30.872
Hurry up.

00:08:31.331 --> 00:08:32.028
All right.

00:08:32.795 --> 00:08:35.082
Uncle Jim, why does no one wash the dishes?

00:08:36.216 --> 00:08:37.757
You do it, Leng.

00:08:39.068 --> 00:08:40.229
So what’s this?

00:08:40.229 --> 00:08:41.642
I recognize him.

00:08:43.219 --> 00:08:44.381
Leave it for adults.

00:09:01.198 --> 00:09:02.466
We’re friends.

00:09:02.466 --> 00:09:04.451
He asked if he could work here.

00:09:05.411 --> 00:09:08.473
Well, you need to be out for work anyway.

00:09:08.808 --> 00:09:10.291
The diner will need an extra hand.

00:09:14.768 --> 00:09:17.686
When will you start working at Officer Supoch’s?

00:09:18.502 --> 00:09:19.624
About now.

00:09:19.911 --> 00:09:21.360
I’m here to grab my portable charger.

00:09:25.768 --> 00:09:26.992
Take the food too.

00:09:27.537 --> 00:09:28.858
I’m sick of your food.

00:09:29.743 --> 00:09:31.480
And don’t pick a fight with anyone.

00:09:36.593 --> 00:09:38.249
Can you quit talking? It’s annoying.

00:09:39.072 --> 00:09:40.383
I’m just warning you.

00:09:56.557 --> 00:09:59.676
Once you’re done with the house chores, you don’t have to do anything else.

00:10:00.718 --> 00:10:03.005
If we’re home, you can leave after that.

00:10:03.005 --> 00:10:05.621
But if we aren’t, please keep Heart company.

00:10:06.017 --> 00:10:09.337
He understands simple hand gestures.

00:10:09.337 --> 00:10:11.599
If he doesn’t, you can write it down.

00:10:18.287 --> 00:10:20.287
Normally, Heart can stay by himself just fine.

00:10:20.531 --> 00:10:23.478
Before you leave, don’t forget to ask him to lock the doors.

00:10:23.598 --> 00:10:27.120
He might be in his room. You can tell if the light is on.

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:32.282
Are you listening to me?

00:10:33.459 --> 00:10:34.537
I am.

00:10:35.736 --> 00:10:36.896
I’ll be leaving then.

00:10:37.183 --> 00:10:38.240
Take care of the house.

00:10:59.019 --> 00:11:00.000
Hey.

00:11:17.604 --> 00:11:18.489
What?

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.364
I’m wiping it.

00:11:23.512 --> 00:11:25.200
I’m cleaning it.

00:11:27.143 --> 00:11:28.459
I am cleaning.

00:11:30.382 --> 00:11:31.066
Ow!

00:11:31.066 --> 00:11:31.819
Shit!

00:12:00.901 --> 00:12:01.666
Here.

00:12:04.163 --> 00:12:06.718
You and I mop the floor together.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.718
You and I…

00:12:17.144 --> 00:12:18.255
mop the floor together.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.065
You’re not doing.

00:12:41.531 --> 00:12:42.694
I’m not doing.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.634
You and I spilled it together.

00:13:17.831 --> 00:13:18.900
We clean it together.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:21.123
Got it? Huh?

00:13:26.985 --> 00:13:28.074
Come on.

00:13:30.628 --> 00:13:31.740
Hurry.

00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:33.654
Do it, chop-chop.

00:13:56.508 --> 00:13:57.308
For me?

00:13:59.484 --> 00:14:00.426
For you.

00:14:06.375 --> 00:14:07.484
The chicken was all sold.

00:14:08.375 --> 00:14:10.787
If you’re done here, you can go home.

00:14:10.787 --> 00:14:11.949
I’ll take it from here.

00:14:15.258 --> 00:14:17.258
There’s one chicken left. Don’t you see?

00:14:18.211 --> 00:14:19.981
Somebody bought it already.

00:14:19.981 --> 00:14:22.677
I’ll chop it, put it in a box, and give it to the delivery guy.

00:14:22.677 --> 00:14:23.445
And I’ll be done.

00:14:25.201 --> 00:14:27.201
Can you teach me how to chop?

00:14:29.463 --> 00:14:32.697
I can help you chop the chicken next time.

00:14:39.768 --> 00:14:41.768
Now that we cut it in half,

00:14:41.768 --> 00:14:44.996
we will cut below the wings and drumsticks.

00:14:46.106 --> 00:14:47.016
Here?

00:14:47.016 --> 00:14:48.106
Yes.

00:14:48.737 --> 00:14:49.823
Be careful.

00:14:54.314 --> 00:14:55.625
Isn’t it too mushy?

00:14:56.142 --> 00:14:57.081
What?

00:15:02.186 --> 00:15:03.151
Here.

00:15:10.383 --> 00:15:11.418
Uncle.

00:15:12.381 --> 00:15:16.505
Why don’t you make it thin and flat first?

00:15:17.855 --> 00:15:18.829
Why?

00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:20.457
You like to eat thin chicken meat?

00:15:21.201 --> 00:15:22.225
No.

00:15:22.455 --> 00:15:24.000
But it will seem like a big serve.

00:15:24.496 --> 00:15:26.040
Other diners do that.

00:15:26.807 --> 00:15:28.491
If I want that,

00:15:28.634 --> 00:15:30.921
I won’t let people eat all they want after midnight, will I?

00:15:39.824 --> 00:15:43.976
Seriously, if you don’t have the ‘Eat all you want’ signature,

00:15:44.883 --> 00:15:46.625
you might make a better profit.

00:15:49.201 --> 00:15:51.201
I won’t make that much better profit.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.810
I’m comfortable with the way I’m doing it.

00:15:54.588 --> 00:15:57.592
I don’t know what to do with the chicken anyway if I bring home.

00:15:57.913 --> 00:15:59.520
I’d rather share it with customers.

00:16:00.047 --> 00:16:01.875
Here. I’ll handle the rest.

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:16.984
What?

00:16:17.328 --> 00:16:18.613
Can’t I look at you?

00:16:28.816 --> 00:16:30.129
The work is over.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.460
Time to go home.

00:16:33.452 --> 00:16:34.629
What?

00:16:35.452 --> 00:16:37.050
Don’t I get extra time tonight?

00:16:38.521 --> 00:16:39.510
You mean this?

00:16:41.605 --> 00:16:42.960
I prefer to drink alone.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.147
Such an artist.

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:51.200
Your wage isn’t that big. Spend it on beer and you’ll have nothing left.

00:16:53.818 --> 00:16:55.502
And who says I want wages at all?

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:04.348
Go home.

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:05.560
I’m going home too.

00:17:10.155 --> 00:17:11.069
Bye-bye.

00:17:15.603 --> 00:17:17.521
You can ride with me to the main street.

00:17:19.879 --> 00:17:20.885
No.

00:17:21.574 --> 00:17:22.941
I can manage on my own.

00:17:23.196 --> 00:17:24.220
I booked my ride.

00:17:26.745 --> 00:17:28.123
If I get in your car,

00:17:29.585 --> 00:17:31.068
I’m afraid I might never reach home.

00:17:41.741 --> 00:17:42.644
Did you call a ride service?

00:17:42.644 --> 00:17:43.520
I did.

00:17:44.042 --> 00:17:45.475
Hold on.

00:17:49.148 --> 00:17:50.260
One moment, please.

00:17:59.666 --> 00:18:00.977
Thank you for helping.

00:18:05.121 --> 00:18:06.314
Don’t thank me.

00:18:07.462 --> 00:18:08.728
I did it for money.

00:18:08.728 --> 00:18:09.765
Bye, Uncle Jim.

00:18:27.889 --> 00:18:29.401
Are you listening to me?

00:18:30.251 --> 00:18:31.574
I am.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.968
If you are, say something.

00:18:33.968 --> 00:18:34.906
So that I know you get what I say.

00:18:34.906 --> 00:18:36.235
Will you stop nagging?

00:19:09.265 --> 00:19:09.929
Here are your chicken wings.

00:19:09.929 --> 00:19:10.827
100 baht, please.

00:19:11.227 --> 00:19:12.444
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:19:13.227 --> 00:19:16.554
Praew, should we become chicken meat vendors?

00:19:16.942 --> 00:19:18.696
They’re rich.

00:19:18.696 --> 00:19:22.659
Look. His gold necklace is as big as my thumb. Damn!

00:19:23.095 --> 00:19:24.212
What a loaded man.

00:19:24.212 --> 00:19:25.777
Oh, yeah?

00:19:26.093 --> 00:19:32.012
Tootee, the boba tea girl, said you didn’t reply to her messages.

00:19:32.372 --> 00:19:33.812
What a homewrecker you are.

00:19:34.058 --> 00:19:35.165
What’s this, Leng?

00:19:35.165 --> 00:19:36.372
Who is Tootee?

00:19:36.517 --> 00:19:38.517
Tootee who? That’s no one.

00:19:38.718 --> 00:19:40.335
Gaipa was being nonsense.

00:19:40.335 --> 00:19:41.836
Take responsibility, Gaipa.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:43.992
I’m kidding, Praew.

00:19:44.603 --> 00:19:45.541
For real.

00:19:45.782 --> 00:19:48.056
If you say you’re kidding, don’t say for real.

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:50.424
Where are you going? Fix what you started.

00:19:51.296 --> 00:19:52.279
It’s nothing.

00:19:52.826 --> 00:19:53.843
Don’t believe him.

00:19:53.843 --> 00:19:54.996
Is her shop over there?

00:19:55.242 --> 00:19:56.229
Where?

00:19:56.442 --> 00:19:58.196
You took a peek when walking past it.

00:19:58.196 --> 00:20:00.054
No way. Don’t trust what he says.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.125
Here.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:03.411
What is it?

00:20:03.411 --> 00:20:04.373
Ah.

00:20:06.562 --> 00:20:07.743
Let’s see.

00:20:08.092 --> 00:20:10.092
[2 chickens, 5 chicken blood cubes, 2 kg of liver,  2 kg of gizzard, 3 kg of chicken carcass]

00:20:10.944 --> 00:20:13.404
Leng, whose handwriting is this?

00:20:14.093 --> 00:20:15.737
Don’t think I’ve seen it. Is it Li Ming’s?

00:20:16.077 --> 00:20:17.558
No. It’s Wen’s.

00:20:17.972 --> 00:20:18.874
Wen?

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:20.560
Who?

00:20:20.913 --> 00:20:22.475
Uncle Jim’s friend.

00:20:22.638 --> 00:20:24.091
He’s passed out drunk at the diner the other day.

00:20:24.091 --> 00:20:25.213
He’s working there now.

00:20:25.545 --> 00:20:26.994
He doesn’t seem fit though.

00:20:27.545 --> 00:20:28.616
Doesn’t seem fit?

00:20:29.159 --> 00:20:30.252
How?

00:20:30.361 --> 00:20:32.800
He looks like he comes from money.

00:20:33.048 --> 00:20:34.601
He shouldn’t be doing something like this.

00:20:34.847 --> 00:20:35.839
He’s good-looking though.

00:20:36.195 --> 00:20:37.052
Yeah?

00:20:37.691 --> 00:20:38.869
You can stop by and say hi.

00:20:40.428 --> 00:20:42.412
But don’t fall for him too.

00:20:43.504 --> 00:20:46.052
Leng, damn you!

00:20:46.052 --> 00:20:48.052
It’s not like I like everyone I see.

00:20:48.052 --> 00:20:48.805
Oh, yeah?

00:20:48.805 --> 00:20:49.684
Hell yeah!

00:20:49.684 --> 00:20:51.237
Don’t forget to answer Tootee.

00:20:51.691 --> 00:20:53.691
Damn it. Tootee again?

00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:56.253
Do you believe him? Seriously?

00:20:56.253 --> 00:20:57.402
I saw you look.

00:20:57.548 --> 00:20:58.842
Are you nuts?

00:20:58.842 --> 00:21:00.478
It’s nothing.

00:21:00.608 --> 00:21:01.653
But you did look.

00:21:01.899 --> 00:21:03.128
I looked around all over the place.

00:21:05.486 --> 00:21:06.846
Uncle Jim.

00:21:07.612 --> 00:21:09.483
The shop isn’t yet open, sir.

00:21:10.268 --> 00:21:11.466
Ah.

00:21:13.299 --> 00:21:14.892
Is Uncle Jim here?

00:21:16.415 --> 00:21:17.199
Uncle.

00:21:19.689 --> 00:21:22.246
Hi, Gaipa.

00:21:22.897 --> 00:21:23.834
What’s up?

00:21:25.393 --> 00:21:27.386
My mom went to Kathin Ceremony.

00:21:27.774 --> 00:21:29.446
She got lots of Thai desserts.

00:21:34.512 --> 00:21:35.332
Have a seat.

00:21:36.492 --> 00:21:37.672
Here.

00:21:38.607 --> 00:21:40.799
She asked if you could help finish some.

00:21:41.822 --> 00:21:44.205
I’d leave it with Leng but I was afraid he’d forget.

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:48.288
Wow.

00:21:49.025 --> 00:21:50.642
This is a lot.

00:21:51.174 --> 00:21:52.603
How can I finish all this?

00:21:52.603 --> 00:21:54.132
Tell your mom I said thank you.

00:21:54.365 --> 00:21:55.439
Of course.

00:21:56.533 --> 00:22:00.892
Uncle Jim, have you heard about the Marina Food Court construction?

00:22:01.695 --> 00:22:03.695
The one that requires market zone adjustment?

00:22:03.832 --> 00:22:05.071
That’s the one.

00:22:05.426 --> 00:22:06.770
Ah.

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:09.944
Song told me about it, but I don’t know the details.

00:22:09.944 --> 00:22:11.681
How far will the food court cover?

00:22:12.378 --> 00:22:15.609
I think they’re using the fresh market zone too.

00:22:15.609 --> 00:22:16.707
The fresh market, huh?

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:19.784
Should we eat?

00:22:23.676 --> 00:22:24.651
Uncle.

00:22:25.973 --> 00:22:28.247
Uncle, should I put this basket of clothes in the back?

00:22:31.664 --> 00:22:32.962
Yes, in the back for now.

00:22:32.962 --> 00:22:34.348
Leng will take it from there.

00:22:41.989 --> 00:22:42.690
Wen.

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:43.989
This is Gaipa.

00:22:43.989 --> 00:22:45.424
Gaipa, this is Wen.

00:22:50.207 --> 00:22:51.250
My friend.

00:22:53.056 --> 00:22:56.092
He’s helping out when Li Ming isn’t here.

00:22:57.292 --> 00:22:59.784
Uncle Jim, you could have just told me.

00:22:59.983 --> 00:23:02.475
Let me know when it’s busy. I can come help.

00:23:02.475 --> 00:23:03.581
It’s okay.

00:23:03.581 --> 00:23:06.197
The diner isn’t that busy and Wen…

00:23:09.293 --> 00:23:10.539
might not be here every day.

00:23:16.092 --> 00:23:16.846
Well then.

00:23:16.846 --> 00:23:18.272
I’ll put this behind the diner.

00:23:26.663 --> 00:23:27.369
Should we eat?

00:23:27.369 --> 00:23:28.307
Sure.

00:23:33.639 --> 00:23:34.429
Thanks a lot.

00:23:36.372 --> 00:23:39.114
Mom complains that her blood sugar keeps rising.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:40.530
That’s why she gave it away.

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:42.403
Even so, there’s still a lot at home.

00:23:43.187 --> 00:23:44.218
Would you like some?

00:23:45.586 --> 00:23:46.555
I’m good.

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:08.733
Wanna join us?

00:24:09.073 --> 00:24:10.461
No. You play.

00:24:10.461 --> 00:24:12.441
I’m going to work. I don’t want to sweat my shirt.

00:24:12.671 --> 00:24:13.921
Take it off and play.

00:24:15.097 --> 00:24:16.039
Oh, come on.

00:24:16.039 --> 00:24:17.515
We’re missing one player. Come on.

00:24:17.515 --> 00:24:18.728
You go on. I’m not playing.

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:23.509
You’re on Pond’s team.

00:24:23.509 --> 00:24:24.420
Get up.

00:24:25.049 --> 00:24:26.680
Come on, bro.

00:24:29.881 --> 00:24:30.636
Come.

00:25:01.712 --> 00:25:03.794
Li, why address your mother's younger brother as if he is older than her?

00:25:07.539 --> 00:25:08.816
People call him Uncle.

00:25:09.144 --> 00:25:10.524
I follow what other people do.

00:25:13.918 --> 00:25:16.274
Should we go eat at Li Ming’s next time?

00:25:16.533 --> 00:25:20.092
His diner was on TV. How cool.

00:25:22.687 --> 00:25:23.840
Go ahead.

00:25:24.687 --> 00:25:26.902
The diner is so quiet during covid.

00:25:27.692 --> 00:25:30.349
Pattaya seems like an abandoned town.

00:25:31.465 --> 00:25:33.821
Which uni are you choosing?

00:25:34.352 --> 00:25:35.942
In Bangkok or here?

00:25:38.988 --> 00:25:40.578
I haven’t decided yet.

00:25:42.548 --> 00:25:44.384
I’m thinking of studying Film at Rangsit University.

00:25:45.647 --> 00:25:48.372
My mom is okay if I join a private institute.

00:25:48.724 --> 00:25:49.822
I don’t need to go through tests.

00:25:49.822 --> 00:25:51.353
For the tuition, I plan to get a student loan.

00:25:51.804 --> 00:25:55.008
Come on. Your mom is loaded. You don’t need a loan, Golf.

00:25:55.008 --> 00:25:56.862
Spare it for those who need it.

00:25:57.945 --> 00:25:59.507
I don’t want to bother my mom.

00:26:01.024 --> 00:26:03.790
I heard from our seniors that we don’t need to pay off the loan.

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:05.382
Those assholes.

00:26:06.968 --> 00:26:08.968
Wow, Golf.

00:26:08.968 --> 00:26:11.663
You must love her very much.

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:13.160
Li Ming, look.

00:26:14.254 --> 00:26:15.850
Cute, right?

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:22.690
My girlfriend’s friend is asking for your chat ID. Are you interested?

00:26:23.286 --> 00:26:25.286
Let me show you her picture.

00:26:26.674 --> 00:26:27.540
No.

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:29.303
Take a look first.

00:26:31.663 --> 00:26:32.531
She’s hot.

00:26:32.996 --> 00:26:33.772
No.

00:26:33.772 --> 00:26:34.738
Let me see.

00:26:34.738 --> 00:26:37.650
Wow. Isn’t she pretty?

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:39.159
Give me her IG.

00:26:39.159 --> 00:26:40.173
She has eyes for him.

00:26:40.173 --> 00:26:42.056
He doesn’t care. I do.

00:26:46.248 --> 00:26:47.287
Li.

00:26:47.616 --> 00:26:48.358
Yeah.

00:26:49.294 --> 00:26:50.810
It’s an English assignment for your group.

00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:51.967
Pass it on to the group members.

00:26:52.458 --> 00:26:53.829
All right. Thanks a lot.

00:26:54.333 --> 00:26:55.540
Bye now. See you.

00:27:38.482 --> 00:27:39.435
Leng!

00:27:40.967 --> 00:27:43.628
Leng, can I borrow your motorbike?

00:27:43.883 --> 00:27:45.883
He’s not here. He’s at the market.

00:27:57.627 --> 00:27:58.492
Li Ming,

00:27:58.902 --> 00:28:01.897
I met Auntie Khiao’s son at the market.

00:28:02.292 --> 00:28:05.167
He said there’s a free tutoring session at Tha Kru School.

00:28:05.167 --> 00:28:07.201
I told him to get the application for you too.

00:28:07.681 --> 00:28:08.860
Don’t forget to go grab it.

00:28:12.876 --> 00:28:13.783
Li Ming.

00:28:17.832 --> 00:28:19.253
Are you listening to me?

00:28:20.093 --> 00:28:21.436
I am.

00:28:22.013 --> 00:28:23.904
If you are, say something.

00:28:23.904 --> 00:28:24.762
So that I know you get what I say.

00:28:24.762 --> 00:28:26.261
Will you stop nagging?

00:28:31.797 --> 00:28:35.028
Why didn’t you ask if I wanted to join or not?

00:28:40.865 --> 00:28:41.885
Can I borrow your car?

00:28:42.651 --> 00:28:44.397
I’m going to work at Officer Supoch's.

00:28:45.628 --> 00:28:46.575
Don’t want to be late.

00:28:50.351 --> 00:28:51.103
Uncle.

00:28:51.688 --> 00:28:53.196
Should I stock up the plates now?

00:28:55.042 --> 00:28:55.893
Go ahead.

00:28:59.942 --> 00:29:01.091
I’ll put them right here.

00:29:01.091 --> 00:29:02.500
Yeah. Thanks a lot.

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.375
[You don’t need to mop. A housemaid will do it.]

00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:03.909
[And you will tell your mom that I don’t work!!]

00:30:16.612 --> 00:30:18.612
[Sorry.]

00:30:38.225 --> 00:30:43.481
[About what?]
[About the liquor. I didn’t know Mom knew you. 
I thought you could get away with it.]

00:30:54.717 --> 00:30:56.717
[Forget it. I actually don’t want to be at the diner.]

00:31:27.012 --> 00:31:28.243
Can you turn the volume up?

00:31:28.653 --> 00:31:30.012
Here. Let me do it.

00:32:00.913 --> 00:32:04.992
[I already paid for these. Keep the receipts in case there’s a problem. - Gaipa]
[This one is overdue. You must pay at the counter yourself. Don’t be late or you’ll miss the deadline again, Uncle Jim. - Gaipa.]

00:32:30.895 --> 00:32:32.895
[I already paid for these. Keep the receipts in case there’s a problem. - Gaipa]
[This one is overdue. You must pay at the counter yourself. Don’t be late or you’ll miss the deadline again, Uncle Jim. - Gaipa.]

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:51.909
Jimbo.

00:32:58.767 --> 00:33:00.001
Come here.

00:33:16.428 --> 00:33:18.647
Enjoying it, huh?

00:33:19.141 --> 00:33:20.840
It’s good, right?

00:33:21.378 --> 00:33:23.761
Eat and help me think, Jimbo.

00:33:24.794 --> 00:33:25.830
What should I do?

00:33:29.523 --> 00:33:31.937
I’ll be right back.

00:33:43.594 --> 00:33:44.598
Uncle.

00:33:50.234 --> 00:33:51.339
Praew is pregnant.

00:33:57.130 --> 00:33:59.130
Leng must take responsibility.

00:34:00.348 --> 00:34:02.348
We must get married in my hometown.

00:34:02.348 --> 00:34:04.512
My parents won’t allow us to live like this.

00:34:06.793 --> 00:34:08.092
Calm down, Praew.

00:34:08.777 --> 00:34:10.640
It’s not like I’m running away.

00:34:11.226 --> 00:34:13.500
You do realize that both of my parents passed away, right?

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:15.039
Where should I get the money from?

00:34:15.935 --> 00:34:17.612
You should give me time to make the money.

00:34:17.612 --> 00:34:19.363
But my growing tummy can’t wait, Leng.

00:34:19.882 --> 00:34:21.882
Praew, easy.

00:34:22.921 --> 00:34:24.456
Figure it out together.

00:34:24.456 --> 00:34:25.950
Leng isn’t going anywhere.

00:34:35.751 --> 00:34:36.673
Uncle,

00:34:37.001 --> 00:34:39.283
should I borrow the money from Madam Jintana?

00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:42.344
Can you even handle the interest?

00:34:42.493 --> 00:34:43.928
It’s 10%.

00:35:02.866 --> 00:35:04.346
You say you don’t have money.

00:35:04.346 --> 00:35:05.757
But you always do for cigarettes, huh?

00:35:06.789 --> 00:35:08.789
It’s just 4 baht a piece.

00:35:09.266 --> 00:35:10.580
I’m stressed out.

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:11.852
I just want to feel better.

00:35:11.852 --> 00:35:13.037
You’re not the only one with stress.

00:35:13.037 --> 00:35:13.892
I can’t spend 4 baht or what?

00:35:13.892 --> 00:35:14.712
No!

00:35:14.712 --> 00:35:15.528
Hey!

00:35:15.692 --> 00:35:17.117
Don’t fight.

00:35:18.362 --> 00:35:20.499
We can’t find the way out right here right now.

00:35:20.742 --> 00:35:22.742
Who else knows about this, Praew?

00:35:22.742 --> 00:35:23.705
Your parents?

00:35:35.713 --> 00:35:36.731
What are you doing here, Uncle Jim?

00:35:37.713 --> 00:35:38.804
Shopping.

00:35:39.027 --> 00:35:40.671
Almost done here. I’m headed home.

00:35:41.154 --> 00:35:41.970
Uncle Jim,

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:44.877
want to grab something to eat?

00:36:15.995 --> 00:36:17.995
[Kongsup Insurance]

00:36:31.901 --> 00:36:33.901
[Car Insurance Collection Letter]

00:36:48.423 --> 00:36:50.035
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:37:01.247 --> 00:37:02.665
I think its legs are tilted.

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.760
But I guess it’s okay.

00:37:08.225 --> 00:37:09.155
It’s all right.

00:37:19.289 --> 00:37:19.969
Hey.

00:37:19.969 --> 00:37:20.561
Yeah?

00:37:20.561 --> 00:37:21.236
Wanna grab something to eat?

00:37:22.071 --> 00:37:23.239
You go ahead.

00:37:28.225 --> 00:37:29.192
What are you doing here, Uncle Jim?

00:37:30.236 --> 00:37:31.229
Shopping.

00:37:31.544 --> 00:37:33.074
Almost done here. I’m headed home.

00:37:34.385 --> 00:37:35.464
You?

00:37:39.113 --> 00:37:39.935
Uncle Jim,

00:37:41.779 --> 00:37:42.714
want to grab something to eat?

00:37:54.568 --> 00:37:55.159
Wow.

00:37:55.499 --> 00:37:57.199
They have lots of customers every day?

00:37:57.199 --> 00:37:57.920
Yeah.

00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.302
It’s typical.

00:37:59.302 --> 00:38:02.396
It’s packed with customers from around noon to 3 p.m.

00:38:02.396 --> 00:38:04.566
People who work nearby come to eat here.

00:38:06.261 --> 00:38:10.202
I thought you ate in the mall every day as you work there.

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:11.477
Come on.

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:12.843
In the mall?

00:38:13.391 --> 00:38:15.537
It’s pricey. Like 200 baht per meal.

00:38:15.537 --> 00:38:17.918
If I do that, I won’t have any money left to save.

00:38:18.749 --> 00:38:20.749
You seem to get a nice salary.

00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:23.445
Not really.

00:38:23.979 --> 00:38:28.116
If so, I wouldn’t work an extra job at your diner.

00:38:37.688 --> 00:38:38.644
Is it good, Uncle?

00:38:47.965 --> 00:38:49.722
One fresh mango, please.

00:38:50.379 --> 00:38:51.270
Want some fruit?

00:38:51.925 --> 00:38:52.743
Sure.

00:38:52.743 --> 00:38:54.207
20 baht, please.

00:38:54.785 --> 00:38:56.445
A 500-baht bill?

00:38:56.445 --> 00:38:57.264
Let me go break it.

00:38:57.264 --> 00:38:59.786
It’s okay. I'll come get the change tomorrow.

00:38:59.786 --> 00:39:01.105
Sure. Thank you.

00:39:01.757 --> 00:39:02.771
Hello.

00:39:02.771 --> 00:39:03.611
Hello, Wen.

00:39:03.611 --> 00:39:04.628
Can I have my regular, please?

00:39:04.628 --> 00:39:06.412
Of course. Four bags, right?

00:39:06.638 --> 00:39:08.225
Did she need to be in such a hurry?

00:39:08.415 --> 00:39:09.147
Her?

00:39:09.657 --> 00:39:10.731
She did, Uncle.

00:39:11.017 --> 00:39:13.648
If she is late, her pay will be deducted by the minute.

00:39:13.907 --> 00:39:14.759
She must hurry.

00:39:15.244 --> 00:39:18.819
If this rule applies at the diner, Leng won’t have any money left.

00:39:21.022 --> 00:39:21.947
So…

00:39:22.651 --> 00:39:24.211
where do you normally have lunch?

00:39:24.919 --> 00:39:27.234
Sometimes, I buy. Sometimes, I cook.

00:39:27.234 --> 00:39:29.070
But I don’t usually wake up to have lunch.

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:31.203
I eat whatever Leng buys for me.

00:39:33.226 --> 00:39:34.294
Yours is ready, Wen.

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:35.712
Thank you.

00:39:36.425 --> 00:39:37.029
Here you go.

00:39:37.029 --> 00:39:37.867
Thank you.

00:39:37.867 --> 00:39:38.826
See you.

00:39:38.826 --> 00:39:40.453
Come again tomorrow.

00:39:41.876 --> 00:39:42.678
Want some?

00:39:44.717 --> 00:39:46.279
It was a big profit.

00:39:46.523 --> 00:39:49.348
100 baht can get you everything in my market.

00:39:49.954 --> 00:39:54.866
But these are peeled, come with sticks, and salt and chili dip.

00:39:57.205 --> 00:39:59.569
Uncle, I need to get back to work.

00:39:59.569 --> 00:40:00.425
I’ll see you later.

00:40:01.006 --> 00:40:02.118
Are you coming this evening?

00:40:05.467 --> 00:40:06.355
Of course, I’m coming.

00:40:08.225 --> 00:40:11.657
My work is easy. Point a finger and give orders. That’s all.

00:40:12.127 --> 00:40:13.933
I have so much time for you.

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:19.940
Your job seems fun.

00:40:21.774 --> 00:40:23.386
Selling Chicken Rice is more pleasurable.

00:40:28.436 --> 00:40:30.630
Uncle, I’m taking off.

00:40:31.693 --> 00:40:32.397
Here.

00:40:33.101 --> 00:40:34.979
Don’t you want it at all?

00:40:35.885 --> 00:40:36.743
Well…

00:40:38.029 --> 00:40:39.171
I’ll take one piece.

00:40:47.762 --> 00:40:48.669
Don’t forget.

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:49.625
Hm?

00:40:49.625 --> 00:40:50.677
To eat.

00:40:51.841 --> 00:40:53.404
Bye.

00:41:08.887 --> 00:41:10.105
We should play football together again.

00:41:10.105 --> 00:41:10.887
Sure.

00:41:10.887 --> 00:41:13.396
How about this Saturday? Are you free?

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:18.577
Hey.

00:41:19.135 --> 00:41:20.803
We better hurry.

00:41:20.803 --> 00:41:21.750
Golf said the pizza has been served.

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:23.421
You go ahead. I’ll catch up with you.

00:41:24.067 --> 00:41:25.010
Go.

00:41:26.067 --> 00:41:27.124
Spare me some.

00:41:27.124 --> 00:41:28.266
All right. Come quickly.

00:41:32.783 --> 00:41:33.518
Li Ming.

00:41:34.416 --> 00:41:35.273
Wen.

00:41:35.945 --> 00:41:36.985
Hello.

00:41:42.702 --> 00:41:43.765
Wanna join Work &amp; Travel?

00:41:44.702 --> 00:41:46.464
I want to go to the states.

00:41:47.291 --> 00:41:49.655
Or somewhere affordable.

00:41:51.592 --> 00:41:53.225
Why don’t you walk in and talk to her?

00:41:55.294 --> 00:41:56.481
I don’t know the language.

00:42:00.752 --> 00:42:02.924
America and Australia?

00:42:04.536 --> 00:42:07.895
Where would you choose if you could?

00:42:10.681 --> 00:42:12.196
It actually depends on the person.

00:42:12.587 --> 00:42:14.587
And the money you have.

00:42:15.208 --> 00:42:18.494
I’d choose America as I think it’s more interesting.

00:42:18.666 --> 00:42:20.666
Besides, I have some relatives there.

00:42:21.298 --> 00:42:22.189
You do?

00:42:22.189 --> 00:42:22.983
Yeah.

00:42:23.268 --> 00:42:27.465
Then can I ask you if I need some advice?

00:42:27.465 --> 00:42:28.755
Of course.

00:42:29.451 --> 00:42:31.451
You can message me.

00:42:31.451 --> 00:42:32.470
Here’s my chat ID.

00:42:42.076 --> 00:42:44.294
Have you asked Uncle Jim though?

00:43:14.052 --> 00:43:14.897
Hey.

00:43:15.674 --> 00:43:16.463
Hey.

00:43:18.745 --> 00:43:19.560
Hey.

00:43:30.314 --> 00:43:32.314
Ah. You want to wash it yourself?

00:43:33.058 --> 00:43:34.010
Thanks a lot.

00:43:40.829 --> 00:43:42.799
I have nothing to do tonight.

00:43:53.095 --> 00:43:54.464
Are you asking me to watch a movie?

00:44:07.317 --> 00:44:10.094
I want to watch a Thai movie, but there are no subtitles.

00:44:19.191 --> 00:44:21.943
Can you tell me what happens in the key scenes?

00:44:26.144 --> 00:44:28.824
You’re ordering me around…

00:44:30.486 --> 00:44:32.316
You’re ordering me around like I’m your minion.

00:44:47.292 --> 00:44:48.831
[I see you can understand it just fine.]

00:45:02.457 --> 00:45:03.785
[I can guess the main idea. But for some scenes, I can’t. I want to know what’s going on.]

00:45:11.935 --> 00:45:13.935
[All right. Next time, let me know which one you want to watch. I watch it with you.]

00:45:21.704 --> 00:45:22.711
For what?

00:45:23.225 --> 00:45:24.218
Oh, right.

00:45:27.665 --> 00:45:29.204
[For what?]

00:45:33.245 --> 00:45:35.245
[For being my ears.]

00:45:40.185 --> 00:45:42.331
[Should we catch a movie at the cinema next time?]

00:45:46.879 --> 00:45:47.908
Wanna go?

00:46:00.377 --> 00:46:04.246
[I can’t. Ever since I went deaf, my mom forbids me from going out.]

00:46:39.824 --> 00:46:40.572
Leng.

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:41.848
Yes, Uncle?

00:46:42.532 --> 00:46:43.251
Here.

00:46:43.639 --> 00:46:44.677
My gift for you.

00:46:45.262 --> 00:46:46.213
What now?

00:46:46.528 --> 00:46:47.747
I bet they’re leftovers again.

00:46:56.335 --> 00:46:57.521
Why dressed up today?

00:46:58.225 --> 00:46:59.039
Where did you go?

00:46:59.319 --> 00:47:00.276
I ran an errand.

00:47:01.926 --> 00:47:02.969
What errand?

00:47:04.042 --> 00:47:04.947
None of your business.

00:47:12.082 --> 00:47:13.177
Whose gold necklace?

00:47:17.475 --> 00:47:18.352
Here.

00:47:20.342 --> 00:47:21.465
I bought it for you.

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:25.375
It’s Praew’s dowry.

00:47:29.306 --> 00:47:30.334
Are you serious?

00:47:41.653 --> 00:47:43.225
Don’t you sell it.

00:47:46.762 --> 00:47:47.716
Uncle, thank you.

00:47:47.716 --> 00:47:48.762
Leng!

00:47:48.926 --> 00:47:49.857
I’m giving you a reward.

00:47:49.857 --> 00:47:51.120
I don’t want your damn reward.

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:53.822
- Leng, back to your seat.
- Go ahead, Leng.

00:48:03.107 --> 00:48:04.142
What about you?

00:48:04.263 --> 00:48:05.228
What’s going on?

00:48:05.772 --> 00:48:07.481
One during the day, another at night.

00:48:08.018 --> 00:48:09.190
Why don’t you pick one?

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:13.003
Be respectful, Leng.

00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:16.190
Get serious with someone.

00:48:16.613 --> 00:48:17.561
Kill your loneliness.

00:48:20.959 --> 00:48:22.399
How do you know I’m lonely?

00:48:23.978 --> 00:48:25.978
Well, we’re all destined to pair up with someone.

00:48:26.646 --> 00:48:29.253
I can't stay with you forever, you know?

00:48:29.253 --> 00:48:30.533
I’m having a wife. See?

00:48:30.923 --> 00:48:32.705
Just deal with your own business.

00:48:32.705 --> 00:48:33.822
Don’t you worry about me.

00:48:35.984 --> 00:48:36.945
I’m going to see Praew.

00:48:36.945 --> 00:48:37.499
Yes.

00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:38.539
Thank you, Uncle Jim.

00:48:38.539 --> 00:48:39.386
Here.

00:48:48.648 --> 00:48:49.507
Is it good?

00:48:57.996 --> 00:48:59.141
Hello.

00:49:00.888 --> 00:49:01.743
What did you say?

00:49:06.377 --> 00:49:07.410
We’re parking.

00:49:07.410 --> 00:49:08.377
Shit!

00:49:10.471 --> 00:49:11.743
I gotta go.

00:49:11.872 --> 00:49:14.260
If we’re to compensate you, how much would you ask?

00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:16.554
3,000 THB would do. I’m in a hurry here.

00:49:41.361 --> 00:49:42.631
Almost there.

00:49:42.878 --> 00:49:43.855
We’re parking.

00:49:43.855 --> 00:49:45.005
Shit!

00:49:46.907 --> 00:49:48.031
I gotta go.

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:53.770
Are you guys all right?

00:49:55.813 --> 00:49:56.536
Gosh.

00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:58.116
Are you okay?

00:50:01.462 --> 00:50:03.117
You okay? Are you hurt?

00:50:03.304 --> 00:50:05.439
It hurts. My leg might be broken.

00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:10.000
Mister, why didn’t you look carefully when you reversed a car?

00:50:10.208 --> 00:50:12.208
We had the light on. Couldn't you see us?

00:50:13.907 --> 00:50:15.264
Sir, please calm.

00:50:16.162 --> 00:50:17.613
Uncle, do you have the car insurance?

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:19.037
One sec.

00:50:20.564 --> 00:50:21.565
Are you all right?

00:50:25.245 --> 00:50:26.114
Clean your wound.

00:50:26.114 --> 00:50:26.920
[Kongsup Car Insurance]

00:50:27.715 --> 00:50:31.080
If we’re to compensate you, how much would you ask?

00:50:32.328 --> 00:50:34.520
3,000 THB would do. I’m in a hurry here.

00:50:40.433 --> 00:50:41.140
Uncle.

00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:43.353
What did the insurance staff say?

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:45.932
He’s in a rush.

00:50:45.932 --> 00:50:47.391
He said we could pay him.

00:50:47.391 --> 00:50:49.759
Then you can deal with the insurance company later.

00:50:50.564 --> 00:50:51.682
How much is he asking?

00:50:51.862 --> 00:50:52.744
3,000 baht.

00:50:53.112 --> 00:50:53.815
3,000 baht?

00:50:54.466 --> 00:50:55.988
My car insurance just expired.

00:50:56.373 --> 00:50:57.873
I’ll pay him.

00:50:58.098 --> 00:50:59.480
Just tell him to wait a moment.

00:51:21.343 --> 00:51:23.163
I advanced it.

00:51:26.003 --> 00:51:27.035
I will transfer it back.

00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:30.158
It’s fine.

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:33.720
This wouldn’t happen if I didn’t ask you to drop me off here.

00:51:34.093 --> 00:51:34.962
We can’t do that.

00:51:36.556 --> 00:51:37.687
Come on.

00:51:39.776 --> 00:51:41.240
Let’s talk later.

00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.266
I need to get to work now.

00:51:42.356 --> 00:51:43.130
Thank you.

00:51:44.601 --> 00:51:45.373
Hello.

00:51:46.601 --> 00:51:47.829
I’m almost there.

00:52:06.747 --> 00:52:08.119
We don’t have enough bats on this side.

00:52:08.501 --> 00:52:09.600
Why not?

00:52:10.199 --> 00:52:12.693
I think Jack sent us the wrong work file.

00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:13.721
Wrong file?

00:52:13.721 --> 00:52:14.374
Yeah.

00:52:17.226 --> 00:52:17.765
Damn it.

00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:21.061
Can we use black fabric instead?

00:52:22.164 --> 00:52:23.324
Don’t think it will look good.

00:52:24.164 --> 00:52:25.004
It’s weird.

00:52:25.819 --> 00:52:26.781
You’re right.

00:52:28.442 --> 00:52:30.064
We should put it up inside.

00:52:33.528 --> 00:52:34.653
Black papers work.

00:52:35.237 --> 00:52:36.539
But I think if we…

00:53:04.388 --> 00:53:05.737
You came yourself.

00:53:05.737 --> 00:53:06.367
I did.

00:53:08.937 --> 00:53:11.902
Great job you did here.

00:53:12.394 --> 00:53:13.521
Thank you, sir.

00:53:13.521 --> 00:53:15.202
Sorry though. It’s a little later than scheduled.

00:53:15.871 --> 00:53:17.339
Can I please get your chat ID?

00:53:17.676 --> 00:53:18.522
My chat ID?

00:53:18.522 --> 00:53:21.261
Yes. We can discuss work afterward.

00:53:21.643 --> 00:53:22.856
That’s awesome.

00:53:39.483 --> 00:53:40.563
Is this you?

00:54:04.136 --> 00:54:06.091
Does the beer here taste better than the beer at your diner?

00:54:17.204 --> 00:54:18.822
Beer tastes the same everywhere.

00:54:19.461 --> 00:54:20.817
How can it taste better?

00:54:24.813 --> 00:54:27.320
You are not romantic at all. You know that?

00:54:29.777 --> 00:54:31.777
When you’re almost 40 like me,

00:54:32.462 --> 00:54:34.282
with one nephew, one employee,

00:54:34.601 --> 00:54:37.589
a house, a car, and a money pool to deal with,

00:54:37.974 --> 00:54:39.186
you can’t afford to be romantic.

00:54:39.792 --> 00:54:41.231
Life is bitter.

00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:43.432
Bitter like beer?

00:54:45.004 --> 00:54:46.072
Beer is much sweeter in comparison.

00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:49.320
That’s why you drink it every day.

00:54:54.311 --> 00:54:56.199
I drink because I want to get drunk.

00:54:57.758 --> 00:54:58.997
When I’m drunk, I don’t dream.

00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:01.240
Just sleep and wake up.

00:55:05.197 --> 00:55:06.247
Do you have a dream?

00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:11.283
My dream isn’t romantic.

00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:14.159
Pay off my debt.

00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:16.028
Financially support my nephew until he graduates.

00:55:18.545 --> 00:55:20.837
And I’d like to experience having a million baht.

00:55:20.837 --> 00:55:21.864
See what it’s like.

00:55:22.775 --> 00:55:23.675
What is yours?

00:55:41.989 --> 00:55:43.027
I want home.

00:55:47.450 --> 00:55:50.365
Home where someone waits for me.

00:55:52.114 --> 00:55:53.643
When I get home, all my tiredness is gone.

00:55:54.816 --> 00:55:56.277
When I’m home, I have peace of mind.

00:55:59.114 --> 00:56:01.114
Not just a place to sleep.

00:56:05.852 --> 00:56:07.156
Don’t you already have one?

00:56:09.694 --> 00:56:10.713
I don’t.

00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:27.341
Don’t.

00:56:31.415 --> 00:56:32.135
It’s not good.

00:56:35.009 --> 00:56:38.512
If you don’t try, how can you tell if it’s good or not?

00:56:57.925 --> 00:56:58.947
Okay, Uncle.

00:56:59.710 --> 00:57:00.688
I get it.

00:57:03.149 --> 00:57:04.581
I see I’m not the right person.

00:57:05.906 --> 00:57:07.686
Sorry for making you uncomfortable.

00:57:07.686 --> 00:57:08.369
Hey.

00:57:09.008 --> 00:57:09.881
I’m okay.

00:57:11.138 --> 00:57:12.265
You will be okay too.

00:57:18.333 --> 00:57:21.433
Can you lend me your shoulder?

00:57:27.078 --> 00:57:27.879
Why should I?

00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:30.619
As an acquaintance, if you don't mind

00:57:53.075 --> 00:57:54.828
Don’t waste your time on me.

00:58:00.669 --> 00:58:01.606
Someone like me

00:58:04.749 --> 00:58:06.598
doesn’t fit to be anyone’s home.

00:58:50.676 --> 00:58:54.315
Directed by Noppharnach Chaiyahwimhon

00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:56.720
I used to argue with my sister.

00:58:56.720 --> 00:59:00.162
She claimed that man-to-man love does not exist.

00:59:00.162 --> 00:59:01.402
Do you know what I said to her?

00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:02.513
I said, “I’ll show you.”

00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:04.600
What a cunning son you are.

00:59:06.201 --> 00:59:09.000
Tell me which faculty or university you want to go to.

00:59:09.171 --> 00:59:11.720
Do you still need your uncle to make school decisions for you?

00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:12.908
What do you want to be?

00:59:12.908 --> 00:59:14.541
I don’t know yet.

00:59:15.018 --> 00:59:16.838
Do you want to go Loy Krathong together?
