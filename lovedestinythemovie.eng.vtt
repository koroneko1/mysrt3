THIS MOVIE IS INSPIRED
BY HISTORICAL ANECDOTES,

00:56.958 --> 00:59.583
PEOPLE, PLACES, AND EPOCHS.

00:59.666 --> 01:03.208
THE EVENTS DEPICTED IN THIS MOVIE
ARE FICTITIOUS.

01:28.625 --> 01:32.916
LUANG AWUTWISET

01:38.833 --> 01:45.833
MRT BLUE LINE
TO THA PHRA - BANG WA - PHASI CHAROEN

01:49.458 --> 01:52.000
2021

01:57.625 --> 02:02.625
I'M WAITING AT YOUR HOUSE.

02:02.708 --> 02:05.833
JUST A SECOND.
I'M GETTING OFF FROM THE MRT.

02:06.416 --> 02:10.958
IF YOU'RE NOT HERE IN 10 MINUTES,
I'M LEAVING.

02:12.708 --> 02:15.750
HOLD ON. I'LL GIVE YOU A DISCOUNT
ON ANY PIECE YOU LIKE.

02:43.708 --> 02:45.291
Has this house been sold already?

02:50.083 --> 02:51.000
Yes.

02:53.125 --> 02:54.791
I didn't get a good price for it.

02:54.875 --> 02:57.041
But I don't know why I'd keep it.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.375
But this one, Noon.

03:01.875 --> 03:03.958
It's the gun of Luang Awutwiset.

03:06.166 --> 03:07.375
My family heirloom.

03:07.958 --> 03:09.458
From Rama III era.

03:09.541 --> 03:12.875
He was the owner
of Thailand's first department store.

03:18.041 --> 03:19.291
Here. Take a look at this.

03:27.541 --> 03:28.458
Noon.

03:30.041 --> 03:32.083
Do you see this wooden box in this photo?

03:32.166 --> 03:33.375
It's the same one.

03:35.750 --> 03:40.750
This is a picture of the grandparents
of my great-great-great grandma.

03:41.500 --> 03:44.833
If you want it,
I'll throw in this picture too.

03:44.916 --> 03:46.875
They're your ancestors.

03:47.625 --> 03:49.125
Keep it to pay respects.

03:50.250 --> 03:51.166
As for the gun…

03:51.250 --> 03:53.791
LUANG AWUTWISET

03:56.916 --> 03:59.666
I'll give you 500,000.

04:08.500 --> 04:11.541
Well, that sounds okay, but…

04:13.500 --> 04:14.833
let me go talk with my mom first.

04:15.416 --> 04:16.666
She's really possessive of it.

04:17.250 --> 04:20.666
Tell your mom I can go up to 600,000.

04:21.750 --> 04:23.500
650,000 then.

04:28.958 --> 04:30.833
MRS. LEELAWADEE HUNTRAKUL

04:30.916 --> 04:31.916
Mom.

04:33.291 --> 04:37.041
I know the gun has a long history.

04:38.125 --> 04:42.000
But, he really is giving
a great price, Mom.

04:42.833 --> 04:44.250
It's enough to buy a car.

04:45.458 --> 04:48.000
But, if you're not okay,

04:48.791 --> 04:50.083
then send me a signal.

04:51.125 --> 04:56.541
Whether it be a strong wind, thunder,
or make something fall.

05:04.666 --> 05:05.875
You're okay with it?

05:07.208 --> 05:08.333
Well…

05:08.416 --> 05:09.791
I'm going to sell it then.

05:56.875 --> 05:58.000
What?

06:04.500 --> 06:05.375
What?

06:52.958 --> 06:53.958
What?

06:58.500 --> 06:59.666
Come on.

07:07.583 --> 07:08.458
Why?

07:49.458 --> 07:50.666
What?

08:05.041 --> 08:06.541
CHAO PHRAYA RIVER

08:07.791 --> 08:11.291
PRAYURAWONGSAWAS PAGODA

08:24.791 --> 08:28.125
SUNTHORN PHU'S RESIDENCE

08:31.625 --> 08:33.458
CITY WALL

08:33.541 --> 08:34.791
THE ROYAL PALACE

08:48.041 --> 08:51.333

1844

08:53.416 --> 08:56.041
ASSUMPTION CHURCH

09:31.416 --> 09:33.333
The newsletter stated this.

09:33.416 --> 09:35.875
This means the Express

09:35.958 --> 09:38.000
is close to arriving to Siam,
am I right, sir?

09:46.750 --> 09:47.583
Sir.

09:50.250 --> 09:51.083
Sir.

10:04.583 --> 10:07.791
I just bought this from a Chinese merchant
at the market.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.791
Father Jean-Baptiste Pallegoix.

10:09.875 --> 10:12.541
Could you please pay attention
to what I'm saying, sir?

10:12.625 --> 10:14.625
Sure.

10:14.708 --> 10:17.500
Come take a look at this, Miss Gaysorn.

10:32.500 --> 10:33.625
What language is this?

10:34.125 --> 10:35.500
It's not Khmer.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.666
I'm not sure if it's Siamese.

10:39.291 --> 10:41.458
Take a look. Can you read it or not?

10:45.375 --> 10:47.208
They're Siamese characters, sir.

10:47.291 --> 10:49.000
But it's written in a strange manner.

10:54.250 --> 10:57.583
"My name is Ketsurang."

10:57.666 --> 11:01.375
"I'm a fourth-year archeology student."

11:01.958 --> 11:04.541
"I'm a bit on the plus-size kind of girl."

11:05.125 --> 11:10.916
"And in the year of 2018 C.E.,

11:11.541 --> 11:14.375
I traveled back in time…"

11:15.791 --> 11:18.875
"<i>I'm now in the body of Lady Karaket,</i>

11:20.166 --> 11:22.500
<i>the most beautiful…</i>

11:22.583 --> 11:25.541
just like Miss Grand…

11:26.833 --> 11:29.208
Ayutthaya!"

11:30.750 --> 11:32.625
"Ayutthaya…"

11:33.250 --> 11:34.791
Must mean the city Ayutthaya.

11:36.875 --> 11:38.416
But, "traveled back in time…"

11:38.500 --> 11:39.875
What does this mean, sir?

11:45.250 --> 11:50.333
"Darn. Freaking cool."

11:50.416 --> 11:54.500
"Dej got promoted

11:54.583 --> 11:58.666
to Khun Sriwisarnwaja."

12:06.166 --> 12:08.666
This journal is very interesting indeed.

12:10.375 --> 12:13.916
Will you please study it
and tell me about it later?

12:17.291 --> 12:18.416
Yes, sir.

13:03.208 --> 13:04.166
Dej!

13:04.250 --> 13:05.166
Karaket, my love.

13:05.916 --> 13:08.083
Are thou secretly writing about me?

13:09.166 --> 13:12.375
This is my personal journal.
You aren't allowed to read it.

13:14.291 --> 13:15.125
No!

14:06.000 --> 14:06.833
Bhop.

14:08.333 --> 14:10.250
Are you awake yet, son?

14:11.125 --> 14:12.083
Not yet, Mother.

14:13.083 --> 14:15.125
Then who is it that is answering me?

14:16.875 --> 14:20.333
I think it's time for you
to meet your fiancée.

14:20.416 --> 14:22.166
You've been stalling for years.

14:22.250 --> 14:25.125
You have never seen her in person.

14:26.916 --> 14:28.083
Do you remember?

14:29.250 --> 14:33.291
Your father had tied your lifeline
with Gaysorn's.

14:33.916 --> 14:37.958
If you both marry each other,
your lives will continue on.

14:39.625 --> 14:40.958
But if not…

14:49.208 --> 14:53.750
Either you or Gaysorn will die.

14:54.583 --> 14:55.875
The lifeline will be cut.

14:58.583 --> 15:03.291
If it is you who were to die,
then how could I continue to live?

15:09.875 --> 15:12.541
I intended to go meet
my betrothed today anyway.

15:23.916 --> 15:27.708
CHIEF SOMBATBORDI'S RESIDENCE

15:27.791 --> 15:31.500
POLICE COLONEL'S RESIDENCE

15:39.125 --> 15:41.250
Chief Sombatbordi.

15:41.958 --> 15:44.875
You should have sent word
that you were coming.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.791
Today, Gaysorn isn't at home.

15:49.875 --> 15:53.500
She's gone to study at the church
since the early morning.

15:54.708 --> 15:58.916
It's a pity
that the two of you have not met yet.

16:01.916 --> 16:03.125
That's all right, sir.

16:04.833 --> 16:06.750
I'm here to meet with you, actually.

16:09.541 --> 16:10.833
Four years ago,

16:12.500 --> 16:14.333
my parents and you

16:14.416 --> 16:17.583
verbally betrothed Gaysorn and I
to each other.

16:17.666 --> 16:20.791
However, I was engaged with work.

16:21.375 --> 16:24.375
I had to build the main temple
at Prib Pri city.

16:24.458 --> 16:25.750
When I came back to the capital,

16:26.875 --> 16:29.583
I had to construct the pagoda
at Prayun Temple.

16:31.208 --> 16:36.916
Thus I never had the chance
to meet with Gaysorn.

16:45.041 --> 16:46.208
I…

16:48.375 --> 16:51.041
would like to ask to…

17:00.125 --> 17:01.291
break off our engagement.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.708
I don't find it amusing, Pi.

18:05.791 --> 18:08.208
Next time I'll take you to see
something more amusing.

18:09.125 --> 18:10.250
What is it, miss?

18:11.083 --> 18:14.125
A steamboat from England.
It's made entirely of steel,

18:14.208 --> 18:15.291
but it floats in water.

18:15.875 --> 18:17.000
Miss.

18:17.083 --> 18:18.541
Any ship is the same.

18:18.625 --> 18:19.958
Let's watch the play.

18:20.041 --> 18:24.666
This Prince's royal performing ensemble
is the best ensemble in the capital, miss.

18:25.583 --> 18:26.791
How can you like this?

18:26.875 --> 18:28.333
Phra Aphai Mani is ever the ladies' man.

18:29.041 --> 18:33.375
If I wrote the story,
I'd have the giantess eat him.

18:33.458 --> 18:35.500
Will you please be quiet?

18:36.708 --> 18:38.333
I can't understand what's going on.

18:40.666 --> 18:41.500
Who is it?

18:44.625 --> 18:46.208
Just some man.

18:46.291 --> 18:49.333
He's good-looking,
but his brows are knitted together.

18:49.416 --> 18:52.291
He seems to be a regular here, miss.

18:53.791 --> 18:55.041
Tell him to cover his ears.

18:59.625 --> 19:00.666
Cover your ears, sir.

19:02.666 --> 19:05.666
Tell the person next to you
to cover her mouth.

19:06.166 --> 19:07.291
How rude.

19:07.875 --> 19:09.458
People are watching the show.

20:02.583 --> 20:03.750
Let's go home, Pi.

20:04.416 --> 20:05.416
I've got chills.

20:05.500 --> 20:06.541
Yes, miss.

20:21.541 --> 20:22.666
What is thy name?

20:23.541 --> 20:25.791
Who are thy parents?
Where is thy residence?

20:27.541 --> 20:29.166
Why are you using the word "thy"?

20:29.250 --> 20:30.541
You sound so ancient.

20:31.708 --> 20:33.375
Then by what name shall I call thee?

20:34.625 --> 20:36.333
I haven't learned thy name yet.

20:40.166 --> 20:42.541
My name is Viola.
My sister's name is Fiddle.

20:44.125 --> 20:45.666
Our mother's name is Violin.

20:45.750 --> 20:48.708
Our father's name is Cello.
We're a string ensemble.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.041
You two are good at fiddling around.

20:53.791 --> 20:57.791
And for what reason is thy sister
dressed as a helper?

21:03.375 --> 21:05.041
My sister likes to disguise herself.

21:06.333 --> 21:07.375
That's right.

21:07.458 --> 21:09.250
Or else we won't be able
to leave the house.

21:09.333 --> 21:13.875
Men are waiting to kidnap me
as I am quite the beauty.

21:15.666 --> 21:19.458
Then thou must not have disguised thyself.

21:21.125 --> 21:25.500
Seeing as thou art as beautiful
as the sunset.

21:27.833 --> 21:29.333
Let me tell you something
for your own good.

21:29.875 --> 21:32.500
My lady is already betrothed.

21:32.583 --> 21:34.125
He's a Chief-ranking official.

21:36.041 --> 21:37.333
Is he Mis-Chief or Handker-Chief?

21:38.041 --> 21:39.583
Chief Sombatbordi.

21:42.708 --> 21:43.833
Thou art Gaysorn?

21:45.500 --> 21:46.833
The daughter of the Police Colonel?

21:51.083 --> 21:52.375
How do you know?

21:55.250 --> 21:56.250
I am…

21:58.208 --> 21:59.708
Chief Sombatbordi.

22:03.625 --> 22:05.750
You're my fiancé?

22:06.750 --> 22:07.666
Yes.

22:08.583 --> 22:11.583
This morning I just went to thy house.

22:12.208 --> 22:13.791
Did you arrange
for the wedding day already?

22:16.125 --> 22:17.458
I went to…

22:18.708 --> 22:20.416
…break off our engagement.

22:21.500 --> 22:23.083
How could you say such a thing?

22:25.291 --> 22:26.583
If you do not wed

22:27.291 --> 22:32.125
and if Gaysorn's lifeline is cut off,

22:33.375 --> 22:34.708
who will be responsible?

22:38.708 --> 22:41.041
I will not allow you
to break off the engagement.

22:44.166 --> 22:46.458
I will not allow it, no matter what!

22:46.541 --> 22:47.875
But I want to.

22:49.125 --> 22:50.875
At first, I also wanted to.

22:51.416 --> 22:52.250
<i>But…</i>

22:53.000 --> 22:54.791
…I have my eye on someone else, sir.

22:57.416 --> 22:58.750
Even if I must die,

22:59.875 --> 23:03.541
I really am not able to wed Gaysorn.

23:03.625 --> 23:05.000
I despise men

23:05.083 --> 23:06.583
who do not keep their promises.

23:07.250 --> 23:10.958
You must be hiding mistresses away
in the other cities.

23:11.041 --> 23:16.125
It's good that my daughter
will not have you as her husband!

23:16.875 --> 23:18.291
Madam.

23:18.375 --> 23:20.416
You say such things about my son…

23:20.500 --> 23:22.333
And what about your daughter?

23:23.375 --> 23:24.666
What woman

23:24.750 --> 23:27.791
dresses up and styles her hair
in such a peculiar way?

23:27.875 --> 23:30.958
Why does she not wear her hair
like the other women?

23:31.041 --> 23:33.875
All she does is study foreign subjects.

23:33.958 --> 23:36.541
Such a peculiar woman as her
is not wife material.

23:36.625 --> 23:38.750
That's why you tied her fortune
with my son!

23:38.833 --> 23:41.833
Then you best mind the life of your son.

23:41.916 --> 23:44.041
Who knows when his time will come?

23:44.125 --> 23:46.166
It's your daughter who must be careful.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.708
I'll be waiting to see whose child
will be the first to go!

23:48.791 --> 23:50.708
Hey! Just tell me if the engagement
is broken off or not?

23:56.625 --> 23:57.666
That's enough.

23:58.291 --> 24:02.458
If you want to break off the engagement,
then do so.

24:05.500 --> 24:08.625
Don't you ever show your face
around here again.

24:08.708 --> 24:12.708
Don't even dare to row your boat
past my pier!

24:20.833 --> 24:24.708
Please tell me that thou art Viola.

24:25.750 --> 24:27.000
The daughter of Cello.

24:28.541 --> 24:30.750
You've been building temples
for many years,

24:30.833 --> 24:32.541
yet you don't have enough blessings.

24:58.791 --> 25:00.583
Oh, destiny…

25:02.208 --> 25:04.708
Why are you so mean to me?

25:06.083 --> 25:09.541
My destiny must be like Usaren,

25:09.625 --> 25:12.541
whom Pra Aphai Mani stole his fiancé
away from him.

25:12.625 --> 25:13.500
It's not the same.

25:13.583 --> 25:14.416
How so?

25:14.500 --> 25:19.416
Usaren had his fiancé taken from him,
but you're just a plain fool.

25:19.500 --> 25:20.583
You broke up with her first.

25:23.833 --> 25:25.750
Uncle Phu, you wrote this story.

25:26.458 --> 25:28.708
Then you can change the ending.

25:28.791 --> 25:32.333
Make Usaren reunite with Suwanmali.

25:34.583 --> 25:35.958
Rewrite it now.

25:36.041 --> 25:39.791
So the dancers can rehearse the new dance.

25:41.083 --> 25:45.125
If I changed it,
people would burn down my house.

25:45.208 --> 25:47.875
This is Phra Aphai Mani's story.

25:48.958 --> 25:52.500
The protagonist has to win it all.

25:57.541 --> 25:58.916
What now?

25:59.541 --> 26:01.000
Uncle, you just went treasure hunting.

26:03.083 --> 26:04.875
Did you get any magical items

26:04.958 --> 26:08.000
that can help me
get re-engaged to Gaysorn?

26:09.375 --> 26:10.791
Well…

26:10.875 --> 26:12.708
You know everything.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.458
Take your pick then.

26:16.541 --> 26:21.375
Every piece is sacred and magical.

26:25.208 --> 26:27.416
No. This one you can't have.

26:28.083 --> 26:28.958
It's off limits.

26:29.625 --> 26:32.041
This is the Krishna-Kali scripture.

26:32.666 --> 26:35.125
According to ancient records,

26:35.208 --> 26:40.708
it's used to put curses on people
who think and does evil.

26:40.791 --> 26:44.583
If they are cursed using these chants,
they will die.

26:46.625 --> 26:47.500
Uncle Phu.

26:48.416 --> 26:54.666
Is there any magical item
that will turn back time?

26:56.791 --> 26:59.041
I want to go back to four years ago.

27:00.500 --> 27:02.000
And I would not go anywhere else.

27:03.458 --> 27:06.083
I would rush to see Gaysorn quickly.

27:08.791 --> 27:09.791
All right.

27:10.458 --> 27:12.083
There's only one way.

27:13.166 --> 27:14.458
You need to use this.

27:19.958 --> 27:21.041
My nipple?

27:21.125 --> 27:22.458
Your heart!

27:22.541 --> 27:23.791
Goodness.

27:35.833 --> 27:36.666
Be careful, miss.

27:45.416 --> 27:47.916
Chuen, row as fast as you can.

27:48.000 --> 27:48.916
Yes, miss.

28:20.958 --> 28:22.541
You can go home first.

28:22.625 --> 28:23.458
Yes, sir.

28:23.541 --> 28:25.208
I'm going to the church.

28:25.291 --> 28:26.208
Pi.

28:26.291 --> 28:28.666
What shall I do to not see
this smiling face again?

28:28.750 --> 28:30.291
He hovers around just like a fly.

28:32.291 --> 28:33.208
Miss.

28:33.750 --> 28:35.416
Let's do this.

28:35.500 --> 28:40.208
We have to make the Chief see
that you are a wicked person.

28:40.875 --> 28:43.833
Self-centered, unpredictable,
fussy, and bossy.

28:43.916 --> 28:44.791
Wait.

28:45.333 --> 28:47.416
Is this a plan or your inner thoughts?

28:49.000 --> 28:52.416
Oh, miss, the Chief is looking at us.

28:53.958 --> 28:55.833
You have to slap me, miss.

28:55.916 --> 28:59.083
Let him see that you slap your help
for no reason.

28:59.791 --> 29:00.750
What?

29:01.333 --> 29:03.250
Quickly. Just slap me.

29:03.750 --> 29:05.208
I can't do that.

29:05.291 --> 29:06.583
I love you just like a sister.

29:06.666 --> 29:09.666
Miss! Slap me.

29:10.375 --> 29:12.208
You want that Smiley as your…

29:18.333 --> 29:19.500
Pi.

29:20.208 --> 29:21.791
He didn't see it.

29:21.875 --> 29:22.791
Slap me again.

29:23.833 --> 29:25.416
I think we should change the method.

29:25.500 --> 29:26.875
Slap now!

29:31.083 --> 29:33.000
Miss, slapping isn't enough.

29:33.083 --> 29:36.708
You have to scold me really badly
and very loudly for the Chief to hear.

29:36.791 --> 29:38.791
I can't. I think it's enough.

29:38.875 --> 29:41.291
If it's going to be this tough,
it'd be better to just be honest with him.

29:41.375 --> 29:42.875
Just scold me!

29:42.958 --> 29:44.416
Spew out any curses.

29:44.500 --> 29:46.083
The Chief must hate and fear you.

29:46.166 --> 29:47.208
I can't do it!

29:47.291 --> 29:48.833
You have to!

29:48.916 --> 29:49.875
You must…

29:49.958 --> 29:51.166
Pi, you!

29:52.833 --> 29:55.541
-Chief. He is watching…
-Chucklehead!

29:56.958 --> 29:58.041
Ratbag!

29:59.291 --> 30:01.416
You wench!

30:07.625 --> 30:08.458
Pi.

30:10.166 --> 30:11.333
Did the Chief see it?

30:12.708 --> 30:15.375
I think he did, miss.

30:21.625 --> 30:22.916
Dost thou study here?

30:28.666 --> 30:29.541
You fool!

30:29.625 --> 30:31.208
Take this artifact away.

30:31.291 --> 30:32.708
I'm going to go study!

30:34.208 --> 30:35.291
Buffoon!

30:36.000 --> 30:37.416
Do you want to change sides?

30:37.500 --> 30:38.708
The same side is better.

30:38.791 --> 30:40.708
Leave the other one
for me to chew, please.

30:42.083 --> 30:44.875
-You!
-I know thou art pretending.

30:54.291 --> 30:55.125
Sir.

30:55.208 --> 30:57.416
Where is the chest
that keeps the Lady's journal?

30:57.500 --> 30:58.625
I'm going to continue studying.

31:03.833 --> 31:07.416
This man is your destiny. Am I right?

31:07.500 --> 31:11.125
The fiancé you wish to never meet.

31:16.750 --> 31:17.750
What?

31:18.625 --> 31:20.958
Dej-ti-ny?

31:22.583 --> 31:23.583
Sir.

31:24.166 --> 31:25.208
The chest, please.

31:31.375 --> 31:34.666
I heard that you have built many temples.

31:34.750 --> 31:35.750
Oh, yes, sir.

31:35.833 --> 31:37.166
Sir.

31:37.250 --> 31:40.041
May I have the key to the chest, please?

31:40.125 --> 31:41.958
Key?

31:43.166 --> 31:44.916
Oh, the key.

31:46.125 --> 31:48.000
I guess I forgot it in my room.

31:48.083 --> 31:50.541
I better go get it.

31:59.375 --> 32:01.291
Art thou mad
that I broke off our engagement?

32:03.583 --> 32:05.291
Stop calling me thou.

32:05.375 --> 32:07.541
Who uses that word anymore? So strange.

32:07.625 --> 32:10.833
Oh, if thou dost not want me
to call thee thou,

32:10.916 --> 32:13.125
what dost thou want me to call thee then?

32:18.125 --> 32:19.708
Dost thou know?

32:20.583 --> 32:22.541
I have dreamed of thee for so many years.

32:23.208 --> 32:25.458
We are absolutely destined to be together.

32:26.583 --> 32:29.208
Had I known
that thou were betrothed to me,

32:29.291 --> 32:31.875
I would not have ever
broken off the engagement.

32:35.375 --> 32:36.541
Dost thou loathe me

32:36.625 --> 32:39.166
to the point thou
will not turn to look at me?

32:43.375 --> 32:44.875
I'm not mad that you
broke off the engagement

32:44.958 --> 32:46.458
because I never wanted
to be engaged to you.

32:46.541 --> 32:50.333
I used our engagement as an excuse
to continue my studies here.

32:50.416 --> 32:52.833
Pallegoix has been kind enough
to teach me.

32:52.916 --> 32:54.666
I hadn't planned to study for long.

32:54.750 --> 32:56.916
But now I can speak English well.

33:02.166 --> 33:04.375
Four years! Where have you been?

33:04.958 --> 33:07.750
Is it that you're plain rude
or do you disdain me?

33:07.833 --> 33:09.375
Which is why you never came to meet me?

33:10.083 --> 33:11.958
Oh, no. I apologize.

33:12.041 --> 33:14.125
I'm sorry for letting thee wait so long.

33:16.208 --> 33:18.625
May I ask for us to be engaged once more?

33:21.791 --> 33:24.750
Do you believe
we are destined to be together?

33:27.750 --> 33:30.041
If so, could you wait?

33:30.125 --> 33:31.166
Of course.

33:31.666 --> 33:33.125
No matter how long, I will wait.

33:35.541 --> 33:37.208
Wait until our next life then.

34:21.208 --> 34:22.250
THE BRITISH FACTORY

34:22.333 --> 34:24.666
ROYAL TREASURY PIER

34:25.250 --> 34:26.208
Miss.

34:26.291 --> 34:27.625
Take it easy.

34:28.166 --> 34:30.333
If you fall into the water,
it'll be a big mess.

34:54.250 --> 34:56.041
Pi, hurry.

34:59.833 --> 35:03.708
Rumor has it that angels built it,
so this iron ship can float in water.

35:04.875 --> 35:07.125
A monk's alms bowl
can also float in water.

35:07.208 --> 35:08.625
You're so gullible.

35:39.458 --> 35:42.833
The ship is enormous,
just as rumored, Mr. Hunter.

35:47.666 --> 35:49.000
The bill of sale.

35:59.375 --> 36:03.041
Wasn't the price you gave at first
at 50,000 dollars?

36:04.250 --> 36:07.791
Why has the price increased to 67,000?

36:08.875 --> 36:11.291
The ship was stranded
in a storm in Singapore,

36:11.375 --> 36:13.333
Minister of the Royal Treasury.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.833
Therefore, it had to use more coal.

36:17.666 --> 36:20.041
I didn't raise the price
without any reason.

36:21.625 --> 36:25.833
Siam ordered this steamboat
to wage war with Cochinchina.

36:26.666 --> 36:29.208
But now the war is nearing an end.

36:29.291 --> 36:31.125
This iron ship of yours is…

36:37.000 --> 36:38.083
beautiful…

36:39.375 --> 36:40.500
Absolutely beautiful.

36:43.125 --> 36:44.375
Chief Sombatbordi.

36:45.458 --> 36:47.583
Go wash your face to sober up.

36:48.208 --> 36:50.291
And quickly inspect the steamboat now.

36:50.375 --> 36:51.250
Yes, sir.

36:51.333 --> 36:52.416
Mr. Hunter.

36:52.958 --> 36:53.916
Let's go talk inside.

38:10.708 --> 38:11.708
Miss!

38:12.250 --> 38:13.500
Are you all right?

38:14.833 --> 38:16.125
Are you hurt?

38:16.708 --> 38:18.791
My goodness. How did this happen?

38:18.875 --> 38:20.583
Be careful. Come, miss.

38:24.541 --> 38:25.708
Are you all right?

38:27.291 --> 38:28.208
I'm not hurt…

38:28.291 --> 38:29.291
Hey!

38:31.375 --> 38:32.500
Are you in pain?

38:35.458 --> 38:36.583
No.

38:36.666 --> 38:40.125
But I'm afraid of blood.

38:42.791 --> 38:44.000
What to do?

38:47.166 --> 38:48.583
Let me do it, miss.

38:53.333 --> 38:54.500
Here.

38:56.791 --> 38:58.791
Darn. Freakin' cool.

39:01.583 --> 39:02.750
DARN. FREAKIN' COOL.

39:09.958 --> 39:11.041
Here.

39:11.125 --> 39:12.166
Let me help you.

39:13.041 --> 39:14.333
Oh, dear.

39:14.416 --> 39:16.458
You are all sweaty
as if you lost your hand.

39:22.666 --> 39:24.416
Let's get up, miss.

39:24.500 --> 39:26.208
Let's go. You got all dirty.

39:27.500 --> 39:28.333
Are you all right?

39:50.250 --> 39:51.416
Is this yours?

39:52.125 --> 39:53.666
Oh, yes.

39:54.583 --> 39:55.708
Thank you for picking it up for me.

39:55.791 --> 39:57.000
Who are you?

39:58.208 --> 40:00.041
Why did you bring a pistol here?

40:17.041 --> 40:18.000
Chief.

40:19.208 --> 40:20.541
You're not the police.

40:20.625 --> 40:22.333
You don't have the authority
to arrest anyone.

40:23.916 --> 40:25.333
Let him go right now.

40:26.083 --> 40:28.708
But this is the Royal Treasury's area.

40:28.791 --> 40:32.333
I have the authority to interrogate
strangers who bring in a weapon.

40:37.208 --> 40:38.666
What is your relation to Gaysorn?

40:39.625 --> 40:42.333
Why were you smiling so sweetly
at each other?

40:42.416 --> 40:43.791
Chief!

40:44.458 --> 40:46.791
You're not my fiancé anymore.
Don't act like this.

40:48.666 --> 40:50.625
If you're going to interrogate him,
do it now.

40:55.791 --> 40:57.916
"Luang Awutwiset."

41:01.166 --> 41:03.291
That's the title given to Mr. Hunter.

41:03.375 --> 41:04.833
This pistol isn't yours.

41:07.708 --> 41:09.041
My name is Mathus.

41:09.958 --> 41:12.291
I've been working at
Hunter's British Factory for three years.

41:12.375 --> 41:13.958
Don't you lie to me.

41:14.541 --> 41:18.333
Someone with your looks,
could work with Westerners?

41:35.000 --> 41:36.208
What did he say?

41:37.875 --> 41:39.583
He's Hunter's assistant.

41:39.666 --> 41:40.583
He's good at what he does.

41:40.666 --> 41:42.375
Hunter gave him the gun as a present.

41:47.791 --> 41:49.500
This is a royal gift bestowed by the King.

41:50.083 --> 41:52.791
There's no way Hunter would give it away.

41:54.583 --> 41:56.000
You stole it, didn't you?

41:56.916 --> 41:57.833
What?

42:00.458 --> 42:01.750
Chief!

42:06.958 --> 42:07.791
What is this?

42:08.541 --> 42:10.291
Did you smuggle it over the border?

42:11.208 --> 42:12.791
These are called sunglasses.

42:16.166 --> 42:19.000
Hard material as such must be a weapon

42:19.083 --> 42:20.791
for throwing at people, correct?

42:20.875 --> 42:21.875
No.

42:21.958 --> 42:22.833
It's not a weapon.

42:23.458 --> 42:25.333
It's a mobile phone.

42:30.041 --> 42:31.916
"Mobile phone"?

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
I'm not a thief.

42:39.458 --> 42:42.583
It's my duty to inspect
the steamboat today.

42:49.083 --> 42:50.958
All right. I will let you go.

42:51.750 --> 42:56.125
But I will keep all of these things
to ask Mr. Hunter about them first.

42:58.875 --> 43:00.291
But the pistol is broken…

43:00.375 --> 43:05.166
Do you want to leave
or go to prison with this pistol of yours?

43:13.875 --> 43:14.708
Go.

43:25.458 --> 43:26.291
Move.

43:26.375 --> 43:27.291
Go.

43:57.625 --> 43:58.791
Hello, Ma'am.

44:03.458 --> 44:04.375
Wow!

44:04.458 --> 44:08.250
It smells so nice and looks so good.

44:08.333 --> 44:10.875
What curry did you cook?

44:12.250 --> 44:13.666
"Wary" curry.

44:16.041 --> 44:18.083
Beef "wary" curry.

44:26.375 --> 44:28.833
Mother asked me to come and apologize

44:28.916 --> 44:32.208
to you for saying things
she shouldn't have.

44:41.375 --> 44:43.000
I also have something that's hard to find.

44:43.083 --> 44:45.500
It's grape juice from abroad, ma'am.

45:04.916 --> 45:07.291
It strangely burns my throat.

45:07.375 --> 45:09.875
Are you sure this is grape juice?

45:11.833 --> 45:12.916
Ma'am.

45:13.500 --> 45:15.916
But it has medicinal benefits.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.708
Ever since Mother drank this grape juice,

45:20.333 --> 45:24.541
when the night falls,
Father has not gotten any sleep.

46:01.416 --> 46:04.083
Can I have another glass?

46:05.625 --> 46:06.458
Sure, ma'am.

46:14.250 --> 46:15.875
Refreshing.

46:27.875 --> 46:29.250
Ma'am.

46:29.333 --> 46:30.541
I won't have any.

46:30.625 --> 46:32.416
Just a little.

46:32.500 --> 46:34.791
To boost your blood circulation

46:34.875 --> 46:37.791
and have the strength
to rock the boat all night long.

46:52.125 --> 46:53.041
What?

47:22.333 --> 47:24.708
Have you come back already?

47:24.791 --> 47:28.416
Bhop, my dear son.

47:32.750 --> 47:36.166
Bhop, my dear master-to-be.

47:41.833 --> 47:42.875
Where is your lady?

47:57.916 --> 47:58.791
Yes!

48:00.541 --> 48:01.458
I've been looking for you!

48:02.250 --> 48:03.583
What art thou looking for?

48:03.666 --> 48:05.166
The pistol, of course.

48:24.666 --> 48:26.833
Don't stare at me. I won't be swayed.

48:28.083 --> 48:29.041
Move back.

48:30.250 --> 48:31.583
Shoot me.

48:32.208 --> 48:35.916
So I can die
and I will wait for thee in the next life.

48:37.625 --> 48:40.083
I'm the Police Colonel's daughter.
Don't think I won't dare.

48:41.541 --> 48:43.208
I know that thou dare to.

48:43.291 --> 48:46.583
But, it doesn't have any bullets.

48:49.083 --> 48:50.125
That's my pistol.

48:51.875 --> 48:54.250
CHIEF SOMBATBORDI

49:03.375 --> 49:08.541
That person with the strange name
told thee to steal the pistol back?

49:09.708 --> 49:10.541
Thou art quiet.

49:11.125 --> 49:12.291
This means thou admit.

49:13.375 --> 49:17.083
I will tell the police to arrest

49:17.166 --> 49:18.625
that guy with the strange name.

49:19.125 --> 49:20.041
His name…

49:23.750 --> 49:27.750
I want the pistol you took from the man
whose name is Mathus…

49:28.416 --> 49:29.500
Mathus!

49:31.041 --> 49:32.791
To trade with something.

49:48.208 --> 49:49.666
Just tell us the truth.

49:49.750 --> 49:51.500
And he will return everything to you.

50:03.791 --> 50:08.708
I saw the word "mobile phone"
in Lady Karaket's journal,

50:08.791 --> 50:11.291
which was written in King Narai's time.

50:21.541 --> 50:22.666
"Let me complain a bit."

50:22.750 --> 50:24.625
"I really miss Mom and Grandma."

50:24.708 --> 50:27.000
"It'd be great
if I had my mobile phone here."

50:28.583 --> 50:33.458
Lady Karaket called this journal
<i>Records of Ket's Krungsri</i>.

50:33.541 --> 50:35.791
She wrote the records
for the next generation

50:35.875 --> 50:38.625
to know what will happen to our country.

50:39.416 --> 50:42.125
Did she write what year she came from?

50:43.208 --> 50:48.791
2018 C.E.

50:52.750 --> 50:56.000
I'm from 2021,

50:57.625 --> 51:00.125
which is 177 years from now.

51:07.791 --> 51:09.708
<i>This pistol took me back in time here.</i>

51:10.416 --> 51:12.291
<i>I was surprised and flipped out.</i>

51:12.375 --> 51:15.541
<i>I asked locals where the MRT was.</i>

51:17.250 --> 51:18.875
<i>They must have thought I was a foreigner,</i>

51:18.958 --> 51:21.291
<i>so they took me
to Hunter's British Factory.</i>

51:26.916 --> 51:27.750
<i>When Lady Sap,</i>

51:28.458 --> 51:32.458
<i>Mr. Hunter's wife
found out I could speak English,</i>

51:32.541 --> 51:35.000
<i>she put me to work at the store.</i>

51:35.791 --> 51:37.666
<i>I usually sold things online in my time.</i>

51:38.166 --> 51:40.083
<i>Oh, in simple words,</i>

51:40.166 --> 51:42.750
<i>I was kind of a merchant,
so it's not hard for me.</i>

51:43.541 --> 51:46.208
<i>Shortly, Mr. Hunter entrusted me…</i>

51:47.041 --> 51:48.916
to become his right-hand man.

51:50.375 --> 51:51.208
What?

51:52.625 --> 51:54.708
Oh, I mean…

51:55.958 --> 51:59.375
I was promoted to his assistant,
overseeing the sales for him sometimes.

52:01.500 --> 52:02.333
I then realized

52:03.000 --> 52:05.125
that I came back
to the time of my ancestors.

52:07.541 --> 52:09.791
My family name is Huntrakul.

52:09.875 --> 52:10.708
Well…

52:11.333 --> 52:13.208
it's likely to originate from Hunter.

52:13.291 --> 52:14.500
Family name?

52:15.333 --> 52:17.625
Is it like Westerners' surname?

52:20.541 --> 52:22.041
Let's say you married me.

52:23.250 --> 52:26.208
Your full name would be Gaysorn Huntrakul.

52:26.291 --> 52:27.375
Hey!

52:27.458 --> 52:29.083
You can't say such things.

52:29.875 --> 52:31.000
It's not proper.

52:33.000 --> 52:33.833
All right then.

52:35.166 --> 52:36.875
Let's say you were my son.

52:37.625 --> 52:38.916
Your name would be

52:39.833 --> 52:41.333
Bhop Huntrakul.

52:41.916 --> 52:42.958
Gosh!

52:43.041 --> 52:44.708
There's no way I will ever be your child.

52:46.208 --> 52:47.041
So?

52:47.625 --> 52:50.166
Why are you wasting your time
smelling the flowers here?

52:50.916 --> 52:53.125
Why don't you go back
to where you came from?

52:53.708 --> 52:55.500
I've tried doing so.

53:03.625 --> 53:04.875
<i>For the past three years,</i>

53:04.958 --> 53:07.500
<i>I haven't told anyone
about traveling back in time.</i>

53:09.750 --> 53:13.000
<i>I fired the pistol at Prayun Temple
so many times…</i>

53:18.166 --> 53:19.250
<i> without any success.</i>

53:23.541 --> 53:25.916
<i>Because there's one thing
that isn't the same.</i>

53:30.166 --> 53:31.458
<i>The solar eclipse.</i>

53:33.708 --> 53:35.541
Rahu swallowing the sun?

53:35.625 --> 53:37.833
Oh, yes.

53:37.916 --> 53:39.291
Rahu swallowing the sun.

53:40.041 --> 53:40.875
But…

53:42.250 --> 53:46.250
I don't know when Rahu
will swallow the sun again.

53:47.375 --> 53:49.166
So I carry the pistol
around with me everyday.

53:51.000 --> 53:52.583
If there was Google, it'd be great.

53:55.291 --> 53:56.291
Goo…

53:57.041 --> 53:57.875
What?

54:01.750 --> 54:05.750
It's a guru of everything.

54:06.625 --> 54:07.791
It will answer all your questions.

54:09.250 --> 54:12.208
I know someone
who has answers to everything.

54:21.791 --> 54:22.625
Another two…

54:23.208 --> 54:24.416
Two days?

54:24.500 --> 54:25.625
Two months.

54:26.583 --> 54:30.333
Another two months,
Rahu will swallow the sun.

54:30.416 --> 54:31.583
What?

54:40.208 --> 54:46.791
Oh, but Rahu will swallow the sun
just for a short moment.

54:47.958 --> 54:49.791
If you miss this chance,

54:49.875 --> 54:52.833
I can't tell you
when there will be another one.

54:57.333 --> 54:58.291
I have an idea.

54:59.083 --> 55:01.000
Before Mathus returns home,

55:01.083 --> 55:02.083
sir,

55:02.166 --> 55:04.250
may I have permission
to let Mathus read it?

55:04.333 --> 55:06.416
Mathus can read the words
in this journal fluently.

55:11.416 --> 55:13.791
"Now we're in Rama III era."

55:13.875 --> 55:17.666
"It's the golden age of foreign trade."

55:17.750 --> 55:20.541
"Especially trade with the Chinese."

55:21.125 --> 55:24.666
"Lots of money was earned
by the Royal Treasury."

55:24.750 --> 55:26.041
"This is called the Red Purse Money."

55:27.458 --> 55:28.416
This is very interesting.

55:28.500 --> 55:29.666
Let me take a look.

55:30.458 --> 55:31.833
Oh, okay.

55:34.750 --> 55:36.916
Oh, a girl with glasses.

55:38.916 --> 55:40.125
So beautiful.

55:45.375 --> 55:48.666
Lady Karaket also has records
of Mr. Hunter.

55:49.625 --> 55:51.166
Father Pallegoix is also in it.

55:51.750 --> 55:53.208
"Pallegoix

55:54.000 --> 55:57.458
who wrote the four-language dictionary…"

56:01.208 --> 56:03.333
I don’t want to know about myself.

56:03.416 --> 56:04.583
Oh, wait.

56:06.208 --> 56:08.833
And I also think that you all

56:10.916 --> 56:14.541
should not know about things
that haven't happened yet.

56:14.625 --> 56:17.250
But Lady Karaket wanted us to know, sir.

56:17.333 --> 56:19.041
She wrote the records for us.

56:20.416 --> 56:21.500
Miss Gaysorn.

56:23.041 --> 56:24.708
Return the key to me.

56:34.083 --> 56:38.375
If you don't listen to me,
don't come to study with me anymore.

56:51.375 --> 56:54.291
I prohibit you all
from studying this journal.

56:56.333 --> 56:58.458
Miss Gaysorn, keep it in the cabinet.

57:04.625 --> 57:09.166
Even if it's a bad event,
if it's God's will,

57:09.250 --> 57:11.375
we have to let it happen.

57:14.375 --> 57:16.833
THE PRINCE'S PALACE

57:24.125 --> 57:25.166
No matter what,

57:25.250 --> 57:27.458
I think we should buy the ship
from Mr. Hunter.

57:28.208 --> 57:33.291
Who knows when the colonial troops
of the Westerners will arrive at Siam?

57:33.375 --> 57:36.875
A number of their spies
are secretly disguised among us already.

57:36.958 --> 57:41.833
Our naval fleet should have the ship
and the newest weaponry

57:41.916 --> 57:43.125
to defend ourselves.

57:44.166 --> 57:46.541
I must ask a favor from you,
Phra Surasawad,

57:46.625 --> 57:49.750
the Royal Advisor to the Prince
whom he highly trusts,

57:49.833 --> 57:52.375
to please advise the Prince

57:52.458 --> 57:56.250
to see the advantages
of purchasing this ship.

58:00.041 --> 58:01.458
I won't buy it.

58:06.166 --> 58:09.791
When the Advisor and Minister of Treasury
proposed me to buy this ship,

58:12.583 --> 58:14.958
I've doubted how an iron steamboat

58:15.041 --> 58:17.291
can really float on water
and move on its own.

58:21.041 --> 58:23.625
And your ship arriving so late… Who knows?

58:23.708 --> 58:28.333
You might have modified junk
and towed it from England to Siam.

58:29.333 --> 58:33.458
And now,
you have the nerve to raise the price.

58:35.458 --> 58:38.625
I won't buy it…

58:46.041 --> 58:48.291
Now the ship has arrived.

58:48.875 --> 58:53.458
If you don't believe
the steamboat really can move on its own,

58:53.541 --> 58:54.666
all you have to do

58:55.791 --> 58:58.416
is go out and take a look for yourself!

59:11.208 --> 59:12.500
I don't believe you.

59:14.458 --> 59:16.083
And I'm not going out there to look.

59:17.375 --> 59:18.375
And I…

59:23.625 --> 59:25.125
won't buy your ship.

59:29.250 --> 59:31.000
Let go of him, Khun.

59:38.708 --> 59:39.958
You are fraudsters.

59:40.041 --> 59:42.041
The Siamese are cheats.

59:42.583 --> 59:43.958
They don't keep their promises.

59:45.375 --> 59:48.666
I'm going to tell the British navy
to bring warships

59:49.375 --> 59:51.583
to close off the Gulf of Siam.

1:00:02.166 --> 1:00:03.875
Whoa!

1:00:03.958 --> 1:00:06.000
Hold on, Mr. Hunter.

1:00:06.625 --> 1:00:08.166
Get dressed properly first.

1:00:11.166 --> 1:00:16.541
I have a solution
to dispel any doubts about

1:00:16.625 --> 1:00:22.208
whether a ship made of steel
will float and move on its own or not.

1:00:27.666 --> 1:00:30.500
I would like to ask for your permission
to board the ship

1:00:30.583 --> 1:00:35.125
to study the design and structure
of the ship in detail

1:00:35.958 --> 1:00:37.625
so that I can make a functioning miniature

1:00:37.708 --> 1:00:42.291
and use it to prove to the Prince
where he can see it for himself.

1:00:42.375 --> 1:00:46.375
Chief Sombatbordi is the best craftsman
of the Royal Treasury.

1:00:47.083 --> 1:00:50.541
He has the expertise in mechanical engines
and chemistry.

1:00:51.250 --> 1:00:54.000
Advisor, what are your thoughts?

1:00:57.833 --> 1:00:59.291
I agree to this.

1:01:01.041 --> 1:01:02.291
I hope you will be successful

1:01:02.916 --> 1:01:05.250
in building a miniature steamboat
according to plan.

1:01:07.208 --> 1:01:08.458
Yes, sir.

1:01:14.583 --> 1:01:16.458
Imagine a crocodile coming from the right,

1:01:17.791 --> 1:01:19.500
turn the steering wheel to the left.

1:01:25.291 --> 1:01:26.875
But if it's coming from the left,

1:01:27.541 --> 1:01:29.375
turn the steering wheel to the right.

1:01:30.666 --> 1:01:32.916
I don't see
why there has to be a crocodile.

1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:34.750
If I want to go left, I steer left.

1:01:34.833 --> 1:01:37.458
If I want to go right, I steer right.
It's easier to understand.

1:01:38.083 --> 1:01:39.500
Let me try.

1:01:42.583 --> 1:01:43.416
It's heavy.

1:01:45.583 --> 1:01:47.000
It's hard for you.

1:01:47.875 --> 1:01:51.000
Mathus,
I want to look at the steam engine.

1:01:51.083 --> 1:01:52.833
Can you take me to see it?

1:01:54.041 --> 1:01:55.833
What's wrong with him?

1:02:01.541 --> 1:02:02.750
What is this table?

1:02:03.625 --> 1:02:04.958
Is it to calculate the ship's route?

1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:08.416
It's a game called tic-tac-toe.

1:02:09.791 --> 1:02:12.750
The captain must have been bored,
so he played it to pass the time.

1:02:17.500 --> 1:02:20.375
And the two T's,

1:02:20.458 --> 1:02:21.375
what does it mean?

1:02:21.458 --> 1:02:24.583
I REALLY MISS MOM AND GRANDMA.

1:02:25.166 --> 1:02:27.250
Oh, it's a symbol.

1:02:28.083 --> 1:02:31.208
It's like a crying face.

1:02:59.750 --> 1:03:00.583
Hey.

1:03:06.708 --> 1:03:07.833
Ouch!

1:03:12.416 --> 1:03:14.375
It's just a cramp.

1:03:14.458 --> 1:03:15.708
Bear with it.

1:03:37.916 --> 1:03:38.750
Hey.

1:03:40.583 --> 1:03:41.833
Can I ask you a question?

1:03:44.041 --> 1:03:46.375
What are your intentions with Gaysorn?

1:03:47.541 --> 1:03:48.541
Don't lie.

1:03:49.833 --> 1:03:50.666
Well…

1:03:51.750 --> 1:03:52.583
I like her.

1:03:54.750 --> 1:03:56.208
She's someone I want to go out with.

1:03:57.916 --> 1:03:59.583
Someone you want to go out with?

1:04:00.750 --> 1:04:01.708
What does that mean?

1:04:06.625 --> 1:04:10.458
In my era,
it's normal for men and women to hang out.

1:04:10.541 --> 1:04:11.541
You don't have to overthink things.

1:04:15.958 --> 1:04:18.583
Miss Gaysorn is a sweet person.

1:04:19.583 --> 1:04:21.625
Anyone who meets her
would have to like her.

1:04:21.708 --> 1:04:24.625
But I'm going to return home.

1:04:25.208 --> 1:04:26.375
I won't court her.

1:04:30.458 --> 1:04:34.541
Honestly, your method doesn't work.

1:04:37.875 --> 1:04:39.541
Hey, how about this?

1:04:42.458 --> 1:04:44.041
Wear these sunglasses first.

1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:46.791
I guarantee
it'll make girls go crazy for you.

1:04:46.875 --> 1:04:48.166
ASSUMPTION CHURCH

1:04:48.750 --> 1:04:50.791
WORKSHOP

1:04:57.916 --> 1:04:59.583
You go over there.

1:05:12.833 --> 1:05:16.541
<i>When you are working on the miniature ship
is the best time.</i>

1:05:19.250 --> 1:05:22.833
The first step is to bombard her
with "likes" to show your love.

1:05:22.916 --> 1:05:24.041
What?

1:05:24.125 --> 1:05:25.500
Do we need to use a bomb?

1:05:27.083 --> 1:05:30.291
What can we use in this era
to express your love for her?

1:06:11.833 --> 1:06:14.541
You used flowers
just like the 'heart' button in IG?

1:06:15.708 --> 1:06:16.583
Wow.

1:06:17.708 --> 1:06:18.583
Awesome!

1:06:20.458 --> 1:06:22.000
It's more like awful.

1:06:22.708 --> 1:06:24.000
An awful failure.

1:06:27.416 --> 1:06:29.708
Come on.

1:06:30.791 --> 1:06:32.208
Don't get discouraged.

1:06:32.291 --> 1:06:33.125
Let's keep on going.

1:06:33.208 --> 1:06:38.166
The second method is called
take care and take her heart.

1:06:45.125 --> 1:06:46.458
Have some water, sir.

1:06:52.375 --> 1:06:53.541
-Water…
-Art thou tired?

1:06:54.416 --> 1:06:55.458
Let me pass it for thee.

1:06:59.583 --> 1:07:00.666
Art thou tired?

1:07:00.750 --> 1:07:01.791
Let me do it for thee.

1:07:20.041 --> 1:07:21.916
Art thou tired? I'll turn it for thee.

1:07:24.041 --> 1:07:25.250
Is this the page?

1:07:26.916 --> 1:07:27.791
Or is it this one?

1:07:30.458 --> 1:07:33.541
-Art thou tired?
-Will you please stop asking?

1:07:43.125 --> 1:07:45.208
The next step is the most important.

1:07:45.291 --> 1:07:46.791
This is the death step.

1:07:47.500 --> 1:07:50.541
Because it's the way
you fade out to make her anxious.

1:07:52.375 --> 1:07:55.916
I'm really tired of your funny wording.

1:07:58.708 --> 1:08:02.458
You'll have to disappear
to make her worried.

1:08:03.041 --> 1:08:08.708
And how can I disappear

1:08:08.791 --> 1:08:12.250
when I have to build the ship here?

1:08:16.291 --> 1:08:19.875
Let's just say do whatever you can.

1:08:20.416 --> 1:08:23.375
Just don't let Gaysorn see your face.

1:08:31.166 --> 1:08:32.500
Keep on rowing.

1:08:32.583 --> 1:08:33.416
Yes, sir.

1:08:35.916 --> 1:08:38.541
Doesn’t he come here
to build the miniature?

1:08:39.208 --> 1:08:40.416
Right, miss.

1:08:40.500 --> 1:08:42.083
Why is he passing by this way then?

1:08:48.166 --> 1:08:50.916
<i>When she hasn't seen your face
for a few days,</i>

1:08:51.416 --> 1:08:54.083
<i>she will come to you and ask…</i>

1:09:01.750 --> 1:09:04.125
What's wrong, Chief?

1:09:05.541 --> 1:09:07.250
I'm not free to talk right now.

1:09:08.083 --> 1:09:09.333
I'm not free in the evening either.

1:09:10.500 --> 1:09:12.625
I'm meeting with a friend at the market.

1:09:13.375 --> 1:09:17.083
I'm not free to escort thee home either.

1:09:21.791 --> 1:09:23.083
Oh, the friend is a girl.

1:09:30.625 --> 1:09:32.833
I didn't know someone like you
had friends.

1:09:32.916 --> 1:09:34.250
And a girl friend too.

1:09:35.416 --> 1:09:37.166
Who is she?

1:09:37.791 --> 1:09:41.500
I have someone I go-went-gone out with.

1:09:42.458 --> 1:09:43.833
Just, "go out with."

1:09:47.083 --> 1:09:49.750
But I haven't decided on anything yet.

1:09:49.833 --> 1:09:51.500
It's not anything serious.

1:09:53.250 --> 1:09:55.958
I've stopped believing in destiny already.

1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:04.375
No wonder why you've been
acting strange lately.

1:10:04.458 --> 1:10:07.166
So you've finally stopped
believing in destiny.

1:10:09.875 --> 1:10:11.416
I'm happy for you, Chief.

1:10:12.541 --> 1:10:13.666
Congrats.

1:10:17.708 --> 1:10:19.000
Mathus.

1:10:19.083 --> 1:10:20.625
Want some mangoes?

1:10:23.041 --> 1:10:24.125
Your hand is dirty.

1:10:24.208 --> 1:10:25.875
It's all right. I'll feed you.

1:10:27.375 --> 1:10:28.583
Thanks, Gaysorn.

1:10:33.208 --> 1:10:34.125
Mathus!

1:10:43.666 --> 1:10:47.208
I will heat the boiler.

1:10:47.291 --> 1:10:50.208
The steam will flow through the pipes
to the piston valves,

1:10:50.291 --> 1:10:52.416
pressing them to move up and down,

1:10:52.500 --> 1:10:54.500
rotating the axle
that is attached to the paddle.

1:10:56.041 --> 1:11:01.708
And this is how the pressure used
to move the ship happens.

1:11:11.416 --> 1:11:12.958
Why is the paddle moving so fast?

1:11:14.916 --> 1:11:16.291
It's nothing.

1:11:16.916 --> 1:11:20.416
My machine is just that powerful.

1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:38.958
Watch out!

1:12:04.791 --> 1:12:06.250
Are the two of you all right?

1:12:32.333 --> 1:12:34.416
You don't have to get the doctor.

1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:36.583
I can ask one of the helps
to dress my wound.

1:12:39.916 --> 1:12:40.750
Hi.

1:12:41.375 --> 1:12:42.416
The doctor is here.

1:12:49.458 --> 1:12:50.875
It's gone in quite deep.

1:12:51.625 --> 1:12:53.125
It will need to be stitched up.

1:12:53.208 --> 1:12:54.041
Emelie.

1:13:00.583 --> 1:13:01.541
Chief.

1:13:01.625 --> 1:13:03.375
You don’t have to be afraid.

1:13:03.458 --> 1:13:06.375
In my time, Dr. Bradley is very famous.

1:13:06.458 --> 1:13:09.833
He's acclaimed
as the father of Thai printing.

1:13:10.416 --> 1:13:13.625
And what does it have to do
with my treatment?

1:13:15.250 --> 1:13:16.458
Doctor.

1:13:17.375 --> 1:13:20.041
Your newspaper
is called <i>Bangkok Recorder</i>, right?

1:13:24.541 --> 1:13:27.083
I've been looking for a name
for the newspaper.

1:13:27.166 --> 1:13:29.916
Good
but, please stitch up the wound first.

1:13:34.208 --> 1:13:35.791
If you fell the other way,

1:13:35.875 --> 1:13:39.583
your butt wouldn't have been stabbed
like this.

1:13:39.666 --> 1:13:40.875
It's good

1:13:41.708 --> 1:13:42.541
that I…

1:13:44.625 --> 1:13:45.791
covered you two.

1:13:45.875 --> 1:13:48.583
If not the pole…

1:13:50.166 --> 1:13:53.875
The pole might have stabbed you.

1:13:54.875 --> 1:13:55.916
Instead of going home…

1:13:58.333 --> 1:14:01.291
You might have been a ghost haunting

1:14:02.458 --> 1:14:03.833
the church here.

1:14:07.083 --> 1:14:07.916
Doctor.

1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:09.000
Can you take it easy?

1:14:09.541 --> 1:14:10.500
Just one more.

1:14:10.583 --> 1:14:12.208
Oh, he's detailed.

1:14:13.916 --> 1:14:15.250
You are unharmed.

1:14:16.708 --> 1:14:19.708
And Gaysorn is safe.

1:14:20.916 --> 1:14:22.916
It's my blessing.

1:14:35.166 --> 1:14:36.666
You really are a rare item.

1:14:37.833 --> 1:14:38.666
Rare…

1:14:40.291 --> 1:14:41.250
Rare what?

1:14:41.333 --> 1:14:43.708
Ouch!

1:14:43.791 --> 1:14:46.083
Oh, he's pulling no punches.

1:14:56.166 --> 1:14:57.875
Is it painful?

1:15:01.375 --> 1:15:02.333
Bhop.

1:15:12.666 --> 1:15:14.000
"Bhop."

1:15:36.041 --> 1:15:36.875
Ouch!

1:15:38.750 --> 1:15:39.583
Ouch.

1:15:42.500 --> 1:15:43.333
Bhop.

1:15:44.083 --> 1:15:45.333
What's wrong with your hands?

1:15:45.416 --> 1:15:46.958
Does it hurt?

1:15:47.041 --> 1:15:48.291
May I take a look?

1:16:00.916 --> 1:16:01.958
Red ginger lily.

1:16:02.625 --> 1:16:06.916
People in the old days said
it means unchanging love.

1:16:09.583 --> 1:16:13.166
If it's the old saying,
then it might not be true now.

1:16:18.500 --> 1:16:20.000
But at this moment,

1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:25.625
thy cheeks are as red as the lily.

1:16:33.958 --> 1:16:37.916
And your face
is now so big that the lily can't hide it.

1:16:47.791 --> 1:16:49.000
They're flirting.

1:17:04.125 --> 1:17:06.041
Art thou using

1:17:06.125 --> 1:17:08.916
the "take care and take my heart" method
with me?

1:17:32.625 --> 1:17:34.625
Oh, he just planted an entire tree.

1:17:39.125 --> 1:17:41.125
This time it's orchids.

1:17:42.250 --> 1:17:43.791
What does it mean?

1:17:46.250 --> 1:17:47.333
It means

1:17:48.166 --> 1:17:52.666
a man's blooming love
towards a woman who is dear to him,

1:17:53.458 --> 1:17:55.083
but won't accept him yet.

1:17:56.000 --> 1:17:59.458
Did people in the old days
clearly state that?

1:18:01.375 --> 1:18:02.708
It is my own saying.

1:18:03.750 --> 1:18:05.333
No one from the old days said it.

1:18:41.666 --> 1:18:45.166
Chief is infatuated with you already.

1:18:45.250 --> 1:18:49.250
If he has a taste of your dessert,
he'll be head over heels in love

1:18:49.333 --> 1:18:51.041
as if he drinks a love potion.

1:18:52.500 --> 1:18:54.500
I only know how to make this.

1:18:56.583 --> 1:18:57.750
Take it.

1:18:57.833 --> 1:18:58.708
Yes, miss.

1:19:01.250 --> 1:19:02.625
Oh, really?

1:19:03.500 --> 1:19:04.583
Is it too fast?

1:19:05.166 --> 1:19:06.958
I think it's too late even.

1:19:07.625 --> 1:19:13.166
I've wanted to marry Gaysorn
since we first met.

1:19:17.125 --> 1:19:19.250
Don't be too obvious, miss.

1:19:20.416 --> 1:19:21.500
Can I ask you something?

1:19:22.458 --> 1:19:25.833
What makes you sure
Gaysorn is the right one?

1:19:32.916 --> 1:19:33.791
I have

1:19:35.916 --> 1:19:38.500
dreamed of her for over ten years.

1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:41.958
I've only dreamed of her.

1:19:44.208 --> 1:19:46.125
How could it not be?

1:19:46.833 --> 1:19:50.041
So you like her

1:19:50.125 --> 1:19:52.083
just because she reminds you of your ex?

1:19:54.541 --> 1:19:56.125
It's not just that they look alike.

1:19:57.333 --> 1:19:59.666
It's as if they're the same person!

1:20:00.833 --> 1:20:02.375
If this is your answer,

1:20:02.458 --> 1:20:04.625
I, as a bridesmaid,
won't allow this to pass.

1:20:05.375 --> 1:20:07.125
I'd tell you to go daydreaming.

1:20:14.375 --> 1:20:16.500
What book do you want me to translate?

1:20:16.583 --> 1:20:18.291
I'm in a rush to go home.
It's already late.

1:20:19.166 --> 1:20:21.458
There are some
Westerners' alphabet letters.

1:20:21.541 --> 1:20:22.875
I can't read it.

1:20:24.083 --> 1:20:26.208
I'd like for thou to translate it for me.

1:20:55.583 --> 1:20:56.708
Kneel on one knee.

1:21:03.916 --> 1:21:05.625
This magnolia garland…

1:21:06.125 --> 1:21:10.458
I grew the plant
and made the garland myself.

1:21:12.708 --> 1:21:17.541
I remember in our past life,
thou liked to tuck one behind thy hair.

1:21:21.375 --> 1:21:23.375
Will thou marry me?

1:21:28.250 --> 1:21:31.000
What is the reason
that you want to marry me?

1:21:36.541 --> 1:21:39.958
If your answer is because
we're a destined couple,

1:21:40.500 --> 1:21:41.875
you don't need to answer me.

1:21:42.500 --> 1:21:43.958
That's not the only reason.

1:21:45.666 --> 1:21:46.875
I just think that…

1:21:48.958 --> 1:21:49.791
I…

1:21:51.208 --> 1:21:53.208
I've been getting hurt lately.

1:21:54.875 --> 1:21:57.500
It might be because
we haven't been married as promised.

1:21:59.500 --> 1:22:05.083
I'm very worried that one day
the person who gets hurt is thee.

1:22:08.791 --> 1:22:12.833
So if we weren't betrothed
because our lives depend on it,

1:22:14.083 --> 1:22:16.083
if you had never dreamed of me,

1:22:16.791 --> 1:22:19.041
if we were someone who had just met,

1:22:20.958 --> 1:22:23.416
would you still want to marry me?

1:22:28.708 --> 1:22:31.208
Will thou stop coming up
with things that aren't real?

1:22:32.958 --> 1:22:34.416
Will you stop calling me thou?

1:22:35.166 --> 1:22:38.208
I feel like you're talking
to someone else, not me.

1:23:40.416 --> 1:23:42.333
What are you worried about, Chief?

1:23:43.291 --> 1:23:45.458
The Prince will surely be satisfied

1:23:46.750 --> 1:23:49.291
<i>with the miniature ship you made.</i>

1:24:03.375 --> 1:24:05.916
I thought
you wouldn't be able to complete it.

1:24:07.791 --> 1:24:09.708
But the miniature ship
is able to work perfectly.

1:24:09.791 --> 1:24:11.666
Chief, you truly do have
the skills it takes.

1:24:12.583 --> 1:24:14.041
I'm very impressed.

1:24:15.333 --> 1:24:16.208
This being the situation,

1:24:16.291 --> 1:24:20.750
shall I continue on
with purchasing the ship, sir?

1:24:24.875 --> 1:24:29.250
If our Siamese engineers are so skilled,
they can make their own ship themselves.

1:24:30.125 --> 1:24:34.416
I don't think there is any reason
to waste money on buying a ship

1:24:34.500 --> 1:24:35.916
from the British at all.

1:24:40.541 --> 1:24:42.041
Are you saying

1:24:43.208 --> 1:24:45.916
that we won't buy the ship
from Mr. Hunter, sir?

1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:48.375
What if he reports this
to the British Army?

1:24:50.083 --> 1:24:51.916
Don't you use this to threaten me.

1:24:53.625 --> 1:24:55.208
I'm not afraid of those Westerners.

1:25:39.916 --> 1:25:43.750
THE BRITISH FACTORY
ROYAL TREASURY PIER

1:25:43.833 --> 1:25:47.791
THE PRINCE'S PALACE

1:26:38.083 --> 1:26:39.500
You're here, Pi?

1:26:39.583 --> 1:26:42.708
Come in. I'm almost done reading my book.

1:26:55.083 --> 1:26:56.541
Is Father Pallegoix here or not?

1:26:58.208 --> 1:26:59.166
He's not in.

1:26:59.958 --> 1:27:01.000
What business do you have?

1:27:03.500 --> 1:27:05.916
There's something suspicious
about the steamboat.

1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:10.291
I want to know if Lady Karaket
recorded this in her journal.

1:27:16.375 --> 1:27:19.875
Bhop, I think we should ask
for Pallegoix's permission first.

1:27:20.458 --> 1:27:22.583
He wouldn't allow it anyway.

1:27:23.291 --> 1:27:25.125
I just want to take a quick look.

1:27:40.958 --> 1:27:42.166
This is strange.

1:27:42.250 --> 1:27:44.250
Pallegoix shouldn't have
taken the chest elsewhere.

1:27:53.125 --> 1:27:54.083
Thou.

1:27:58.250 --> 1:27:59.083
Bhop!

1:28:25.291 --> 1:28:26.500
You can't be trusted.

1:28:27.208 --> 1:28:29.375
Wait.

1:28:29.458 --> 1:28:31.708
Hold on. Please listen to me first.

1:28:32.291 --> 1:28:35.125
I just want to know something
from the Lady's journal.

1:28:40.458 --> 1:28:43.041
Once Mr. Hunter found out
that Siam wouldn't buy the ship,

1:28:44.083 --> 1:28:45.375
he was furious.

1:28:51.541 --> 1:28:52.458
Just you wait!

1:28:53.083 --> 1:28:54.125
If they don't buy my ship,

1:28:54.208 --> 1:28:56.708
I'll sell it to their enemy.

1:28:56.791 --> 1:29:00.708
Siam will lose to Cochinchina
because of this ship!

1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:03.333
<i>So, I'd like to know…</i>

1:29:04.125 --> 1:29:06.333
what will happen with the steamboat.

1:29:11.958 --> 1:29:15.583
Well then, please let me take a look.

1:29:20.833 --> 1:29:23.500
I think we should
let it take its own course,

1:29:23.583 --> 1:29:25.666
just like Pallegoix said.

1:29:26.375 --> 1:29:27.208
But…

1:29:28.666 --> 1:29:29.791
How about this?

1:29:30.333 --> 1:29:31.208
Let's take a vote.

1:29:32.375 --> 1:29:33.416
Volt?

1:29:33.500 --> 1:29:34.416
Vote.

1:29:36.250 --> 1:29:37.083
How?

1:29:39.583 --> 1:29:40.791
Do what I say.

1:29:42.375 --> 1:29:46.000
Who thinks we should read the journal?

1:29:46.083 --> 1:29:47.000
Raise your hand.

1:29:55.291 --> 1:29:58.500
Next, who thinks we shouldn't read it?

1:29:58.583 --> 1:29:59.583
Raise your hand.

1:30:06.083 --> 1:30:08.083
All right. Open it.

1:30:08.166 --> 1:30:09.166
Hey!

1:30:09.708 --> 1:30:11.083
But I don't agree.

1:30:11.916 --> 1:30:15.833
The principle of voting is you have
to respect the majority's decision.

1:30:16.416 --> 1:30:21.208
And here, Chief and I, we have two votes.

1:30:21.291 --> 1:30:23.500
You have only one.

1:30:24.750 --> 1:30:27.208
Oh, this is how it works.

1:30:28.875 --> 1:30:33.458
But if I still don't want you to read it,
what do I need to do?

1:30:33.541 --> 1:30:35.791
You just accept it.

1:30:51.833 --> 1:30:52.750
I found Hunter.

1:30:54.000 --> 1:30:57.708
"Hunter brought the Express steamboat
to sell to Siam,

1:30:57.791 --> 1:30:59.625
but Siam turned down the purchase."

1:30:59.708 --> 1:31:02.541
"He then threatened
to sell the ship to Cochinchina,

1:31:03.125 --> 1:31:04.750
which is Vietnam in the future."

1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:13.666
"After that,
Hunter was exiled from the country."

1:31:14.541 --> 1:31:17.708
Just a threat resulted in exile?

1:31:28.750 --> 1:31:29.833
What else did the Lady say?

1:31:33.541 --> 1:31:34.416
She…

1:31:58.958 --> 1:32:00.083
What did you say?

1:32:00.833 --> 1:32:03.791
The thunder was so loud
I couldn't hear you.

1:32:05.000 --> 1:32:09.541
I said
that was all the Lady wrote about Hunter.

1:32:10.375 --> 1:32:12.708
And did she write about the Prince?

1:32:14.500 --> 1:32:15.791
The Prince?

1:32:17.833 --> 1:32:19.125
Yesterday

1:32:19.208 --> 1:32:24.208
I saw some smuggling going on with crates
being brought from Hunter's steamboat

1:32:24.291 --> 1:32:26.541
and stored in the Prince's theater.

1:32:27.833 --> 1:32:29.750
Even though these two hate each other.

1:32:29.833 --> 1:32:31.791
Do you know anything about this?

1:32:34.833 --> 1:32:35.666
I have no idea.

1:32:37.500 --> 1:32:40.083
I have a way to get into the theater.

1:32:41.333 --> 1:32:42.625
Mathus.

1:32:42.708 --> 1:32:45.625
Could you look through
Mr. Hunter's office?

1:32:45.708 --> 1:32:49.958
There might be evidence
that you could bring to me.

1:33:04.250 --> 1:33:06.083
Do not worry.

1:33:07.666 --> 1:33:09.166
Tomorrow when the sun is swallowed,

1:33:11.041 --> 1:33:13.166
we'll send off Mathus together.

1:34:12.416 --> 1:34:15.291
When will the person
from the theater bring the keys?

1:34:15.375 --> 1:34:16.833
No one is coming.

1:34:17.458 --> 1:34:18.833
We'll break in.

1:34:21.750 --> 1:34:26.583
I'll take a look to see
if anyone is guarding that area.

1:34:26.666 --> 1:34:27.916
Whoa.

1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:29.291
It's pitch dark.

1:34:34.750 --> 1:34:36.666
That's your windpipe.

1:34:53.708 --> 1:34:54.541
Bhop.

1:35:23.875 --> 1:35:25.875
Phu, what are you doing, sir?

1:35:28.666 --> 1:35:32.083
I brought a performer
for the master to consider.

1:35:38.250 --> 1:35:42.083
He's famous in Klang city.

1:35:42.666 --> 1:35:46.166
The master asked him to try on the outfit.

1:35:46.250 --> 1:35:50.791
But the room is locked.

1:35:50.875 --> 1:35:54.208
I'm going to go get the key to unlock it.

1:35:54.291 --> 1:35:55.291
Hold on.

1:35:57.500 --> 1:36:01.666
Today is my shift to guard the store room.

1:36:07.250 --> 1:36:09.666
Are you really a famous performer?

1:36:12.875 --> 1:36:14.166
Show me.

1:36:22.958 --> 1:36:24.625
Your moves are awkward.

1:36:25.125 --> 1:36:27.333
How can the people of Klang like you?

1:36:32.833 --> 1:36:33.958
What is that?

1:36:36.208 --> 1:36:38.083
I don't think you're a performer.

1:36:38.166 --> 1:36:39.083
Who is he, sir?

1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:46.500
Phu, why did you hit me?

1:36:50.291 --> 1:36:51.500
So this is it.

1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:54.041
The magical windpipe
that makes people fall asleep.

1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:57.416
Khun Yutthamat.

1:38:03.416 --> 1:38:05.208
That's my butler.

1:38:05.291 --> 1:38:07.375
He gave me a ride here.

1:38:07.458 --> 1:38:08.750
He's trustworthy.

1:38:12.750 --> 1:38:15.333
I already told you.

1:38:15.416 --> 1:38:17.541
Do not bring anyone with you.

1:38:25.625 --> 1:38:26.875
What's in the chest?

1:38:28.625 --> 1:38:29.625
Let's open it.

1:38:37.375 --> 1:38:39.041
It's just curtains for the backdrop.

1:38:39.125 --> 1:38:43.083
I knew it. It's just all in your head.

1:39:00.666 --> 1:39:02.416
With all these muskets,

1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:06.666
the Prince and Hunter
are definitely planning a coup.

1:39:13.041 --> 1:39:13.875
You.

1:39:13.958 --> 1:39:15.583
What did you hear?

1:39:17.041 --> 1:39:18.500
I didn't really hear anything.

1:39:31.958 --> 1:39:33.083
Sir.

1:39:33.708 --> 1:39:36.333
Why did you follow me then?

1:39:40.416 --> 1:39:43.083
Who are you really? Tell me.

1:39:50.500 --> 1:39:53.416
LUANG AWUTWISET

1:39:54.375 --> 1:39:58.416
This pistol has been kept over a century
as a family heirloom.

1:39:59.541 --> 1:40:01.291
I'm your descendant.

1:40:03.291 --> 1:40:04.625
I came from the future.

1:40:05.833 --> 1:40:08.625
I mean, I came from the time ahead.

1:40:11.666 --> 1:40:13.791
What are you talking about?

1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:19.041
Sir.

1:40:21.625 --> 1:40:23.833
Don't follow the Prince's plan.

1:40:25.666 --> 1:40:29.708
<i>Otherwise, you'll be exiled from Siam.</i>

1:40:33.208 --> 1:40:37.666
The Prince and I planned for Siam
to turn down the deal in the first place.

1:40:51.833 --> 1:40:54.625
I agreed to make the deal
because the Prince will make me

1:40:55.333 --> 1:41:00.791
the Minister of the Royal Treasury,
overseeing all the trades in Siam.

1:41:09.541 --> 1:41:10.375
Sir!

1:41:16.833 --> 1:41:18.000
Sir!

1:41:19.125 --> 1:41:20.250
Don’t do this, sir!

1:41:21.541 --> 1:41:24.791
Tomorrow, when I'm done with my business,

1:41:25.500 --> 1:41:27.666
I will send you off to be a slave
in Singapore.

1:41:31.750 --> 1:41:32.750
Sir!

1:41:34.416 --> 1:41:35.708
I'm begging you.

1:41:35.791 --> 1:41:37.208
I have to return home tomorrow!

1:41:40.041 --> 1:41:40.916
Sir!

1:41:52.625 --> 1:41:54.833
Go to bed first, miss.

1:41:55.833 --> 1:41:57.875
The Chief will come soon.

1:42:01.041 --> 1:42:02.208
I can't fall asleep.

1:42:37.833 --> 1:42:39.083
Is this an ominous sign?

1:42:42.666 --> 1:42:43.583
What sign, miss?

1:42:44.375 --> 1:42:45.750
I couldn't hear you.

1:43:24.958 --> 1:43:26.458
What's with the chair?

1:43:27.708 --> 1:43:29.125
Are you tidying up the room?

1:43:29.208 --> 1:43:30.458
Chief.

1:43:32.333 --> 1:43:33.166
Let go.

1:43:35.666 --> 1:43:36.916
I didn't see you coming.

1:43:37.750 --> 1:43:40.291
Just what I thought.
Something bad happened.

1:43:43.541 --> 1:43:45.125
Mr. Hunter locked me up

1:43:46.541 --> 1:43:48.416
because I knew his secret.

1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:50.125
What evidence did you find?

1:44:02.250 --> 1:44:04.125
<i>In the Lady Karaket's journal,</i>

1:44:04.833 --> 1:44:08.625
<i>it said the reason Mr. Hunter was exiled </i>

1:44:08.708 --> 1:44:12.958
<i>was because he put cannons
aboard the steamboat</i>

1:44:14.041 --> 1:44:15.541
<i>and fired them at the city wall.</i>

1:44:25.791 --> 1:44:27.083
And now Mr. Hunter…

1:44:30.625 --> 1:44:32.750
He's heading to the steamboat.

1:44:50.458 --> 1:44:52.000
Didn't Chief come with you?

1:44:57.125 --> 1:44:58.708
Mr. Hunter is preparing a coup.

1:45:00.125 --> 1:45:01.541
They're planning to hand Siam
to the British

1:45:03.500 --> 1:45:04.708
according to the order from the Prince.

1:45:06.708 --> 1:45:10.416
You don't know this because I tore
the page out from the journal.

1:45:10.500 --> 1:45:13.000
What is the reason
for hiding this from me?

1:45:13.958 --> 1:45:17.750
I was afraid that if you knew,

1:45:19.291 --> 1:45:21.291
you would arrest Mr. Hunter

1:45:23.666 --> 1:45:25.666
even though he hasn't done anything yet.

1:45:25.750 --> 1:45:27.791
You really are selfish.

1:45:28.500 --> 1:45:30.375
You're just worried for your ancestor.

1:45:30.916 --> 1:45:32.750
Have you forgotten
about the people of this country?

1:45:35.041 --> 1:45:36.333
No wonder why the Prince

1:45:36.416 --> 1:45:39.125
took the Minister of the Royal Treasury
and my father

1:45:39.208 --> 1:45:40.875
away for urgent work at Pak Nam.

1:45:45.833 --> 1:45:47.375
I'll go home to send an express horse

1:45:47.458 --> 1:45:48.916
to tell Father to return quickly.

1:45:49.750 --> 1:45:50.583
Gaysorn.

1:45:52.875 --> 1:45:53.708
This is for you.

1:45:56.041 --> 1:45:56.958
Miss.

1:46:14.125 --> 1:46:16.416
TO MATHUS, WE WISH FOR YOUR HAPPINESS

1:46:16.500 --> 1:46:18.208
IN 177 YEARS INTO THE FUTURE.

1:46:18.291 --> 1:46:19.791
WE WILL MISS YOU.

1:47:30.291 --> 1:47:33.625
Pi, give this letter to the express horse
and send it to Father.

1:47:34.375 --> 1:47:35.708
Where are you going, miss?

1:47:36.541 --> 1:47:38.166
Are you going after the Chief?

1:47:38.250 --> 1:47:39.458
Don't worry about me.

1:47:39.541 --> 1:47:40.875
Pi, go right now.

1:47:41.375 --> 1:47:43.750
Miss, please don't go.

1:47:43.833 --> 1:47:45.041
It's dangerous.

1:47:46.125 --> 1:47:47.750
Miss, please don't go.

1:47:47.833 --> 1:47:49.375
-Pi!
-Miss!

1:47:49.458 --> 1:47:50.583
Quickly go now.

1:47:50.666 --> 1:47:54.208
Your lifeline might be reaching its end.

1:47:55.333 --> 1:47:58.958
No matter what, I can't let you go.

1:47:59.041 --> 1:47:59.916
No!

1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:02.458
-Let go of me!
-Please don't go, miss!

1:48:02.541 --> 1:48:03.416
Pi!

1:48:03.500 --> 1:48:04.333
Pi!

1:48:22.166 --> 1:48:24.583
Pi, I'm begging you.

1:48:25.416 --> 1:48:28.875
Send this letter to Father right now.

1:48:30.875 --> 1:48:32.041
Miss.

1:49:10.375 --> 1:49:11.708
Stop, Mr. Hunter.

1:49:14.208 --> 1:49:17.541
The Police Colonel is bringing
the soldiers and police here.

1:49:17.625 --> 1:49:19.666
Stop what you're doing.

1:49:23.625 --> 1:49:24.541
Miss.

1:49:25.458 --> 1:49:29.583
What is the Police Colonel
going to arrest me for?

1:49:30.208 --> 1:49:32.416
It just happens
that today is Captain Brown's birthday.

1:49:32.500 --> 1:49:35.208
He's the captain of this steamboat.

1:49:35.291 --> 1:49:37.041
According to our traditions,

1:49:37.125 --> 1:49:40.708
we have to take the ship out
to fire a celebratory salute.

1:49:41.791 --> 1:49:44.333
I know you're planning
to do some bad things.

1:49:58.625 --> 1:49:59.916
-How did you get here?
-Who is there?

1:50:00.583 --> 1:50:01.500
Help!

1:50:01.583 --> 1:50:02.750
Help me.

1:50:02.833 --> 1:50:03.791
Help me.

1:50:13.916 --> 1:50:15.208
Help!

1:50:15.291 --> 1:50:17.333
Help me.

1:52:15.041 --> 1:52:16.541
Sir, what are you doing?

1:52:17.041 --> 1:52:19.583
Aren't we just going to fire up
into the sky?

1:52:19.666 --> 1:52:22.833
Aiming in that direction
is firing at the city wall.

1:52:23.416 --> 1:52:24.791
That's right.

1:52:25.583 --> 1:52:27.500
Won't we all lose our heads?

1:52:28.041 --> 1:52:29.750
Not all of us.

1:52:30.541 --> 1:52:31.375
Just you.

1:52:32.083 --> 1:52:33.875
And your cronies.

1:53:54.791 --> 1:53:59.000
You can sweet talk the Prince into buying…

1:54:00.250 --> 1:54:05.375
I believe that if we purchase
this steamboat,

1:54:05.458 --> 1:54:09.041
Siam will be a feared armed force
in the region.

1:54:09.125 --> 1:54:11.458
<i>…or not buying this steamboat.</i>

1:54:11.541 --> 1:54:13.625
The decision is yours to make.

1:54:14.166 --> 1:54:16.750
The ship is not in an ideal state.

1:54:16.833 --> 1:54:21.000
Siam has the capability
to build our own ship.

1:54:21.083 --> 1:54:25.958
I don't think that we need
to buy the ship from those Westerners.

1:54:35.958 --> 1:54:37.541
<i>"Pao Hoo."</i>

1:54:37.625 --> 1:54:40.250
<i>Pao Hoo! Pao Hoo.</i>

1:58:46.500 --> 1:58:47.791
Bhop.

1:58:49.333 --> 1:58:50.791
Are you all right?

1:58:52.958 --> 1:58:55.250
A moment ago, was I

1:58:57.541 --> 1:58:58.750
cool?

1:59:03.458 --> 1:59:06.416
Freakin' cool, Mr. Sailor!

1:59:08.041 --> 1:59:10.916
But right now, please free me.

1:59:15.625 --> 1:59:18.041
Thou and Mathus
quickly find a hiding place.

1:59:18.541 --> 1:59:19.458
I’ll try to stall them

1:59:20.041 --> 1:59:21.666
while we're waiting
for the troops to come.

1:59:28.083 --> 1:59:29.625
In the time ahead,

1:59:30.458 --> 1:59:32.791
will Siam be a colony under the British?

1:59:33.708 --> 1:59:34.833
Never.

1:59:34.916 --> 1:59:36.083
If so…

1:59:37.166 --> 1:59:41.250
I will make your history

1:59:42.208 --> 1:59:43.541
the same.

1:59:48.666 --> 1:59:50.500
You really are a good ancestor.

2:00:00.125 --> 2:00:00.958
Bhop.

2:00:01.666 --> 2:00:02.875
What about Mr. Hunter?

2:00:18.666 --> 2:00:20.000
Bhop, watch out!

2:00:20.833 --> 2:00:22.125
Hey!

2:00:34.833 --> 2:00:35.708
Mathus.

2:00:52.750 --> 2:00:53.625
Run!

2:01:07.958 --> 2:01:09.000
Wait.

2:01:23.041 --> 2:01:23.916
Go after them!

2:01:28.833 --> 2:01:29.916
You go in first. I'll stall them.

2:01:31.625 --> 2:01:32.583
Don't worry.

2:01:33.916 --> 2:01:34.750
Oops.

2:01:43.875 --> 2:01:45.833
Damn, is that The Hulk?

2:01:46.583 --> 2:01:47.750
SLOW

2:01:51.791 --> 2:01:54.958
Crocodile is on the left,
steer the ship to the right.

2:01:56.500 --> 2:01:59.750
The city wall is on the right,
turn the wheel to the left!

2:02:30.333 --> 2:02:31.208
It's nothing.

2:02:31.875 --> 2:02:33.083
I can take it.

2:02:35.250 --> 2:02:37.833
The masseuse I know
has heavier elbows than you!

2:02:41.708 --> 2:02:45.208
Wait. Chill, man.

2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:51.250
Barn owl!

2:03:37.208 --> 2:03:38.166
Help me.

2:04:14.041 --> 2:04:14.875
Shoot, damn it!

2:05:05.958 --> 2:05:08.375
Aim towards the city wall.
Don't miss it again.

2:05:39.125 --> 2:05:41.333
Hold on. Take it easy.

2:06:13.125 --> 2:06:14.000
Whoa!

2:06:14.083 --> 2:06:16.125
What the hell is wrong with you guys?

2:06:16.208 --> 2:06:17.875
My ears are about to burst!

2:06:41.541 --> 2:06:42.666
Are you a British spy?

2:06:57.875 --> 2:06:58.916
It takes

2:06:59.708 --> 2:07:01.375
a lot of effort and time

2:07:01.458 --> 2:07:02.750
to load the bullets.

2:07:02.833 --> 2:07:05.333
Don't you get that?

2:09:02.750 --> 2:09:05.291
What kind of ominous day is this?

2:10:15.833 --> 2:10:16.833
Don't shoot!

2:10:17.708 --> 2:10:19.250
It might take you forward in time.

2:10:49.041 --> 2:10:50.208
I forgot the bullet.

2:11:15.375 --> 2:11:17.750
Wherever this pistol will take thee,

2:11:19.500 --> 2:11:21.375
I'm going with thee too.

2:12:30.916 --> 2:12:31.750
Bhop!

2:12:32.416 --> 2:12:33.250
Gaysorn!

2:13:30.833 --> 2:13:31.875
Your lady is awake.

2:13:32.958 --> 2:13:35.958
Bring some water for her
to get freshen up right now.

2:13:36.041 --> 2:13:38.250
Yes, sir. Khun Sriwisarnwaja.

2:13:47.625 --> 2:13:49.208
How art thou, my dear Karaket?

2:13:50.500 --> 2:13:52.208
Thou were dead asleep.

2:15:04.291 --> 2:15:07.958
THIS JOURNAL IS MADE AS A RECORD
OF EVENTS IN AYUTTHAYA ERA.

2:15:11.583 --> 2:15:15.916
MY NAME IS KETSURANG.
I'M A FOURTH-YEAR ARCHEOLOGY STUDENT.

2:15:46.791 --> 2:15:49.666
Thou have filled up all the pages
in thy journal, correct?

2:15:51.583 --> 2:15:52.791
It's all right.

2:15:53.458 --> 2:15:57.583
I'll have someone make new ones for thee,
just like this one.

2:16:34.541 --> 2:16:35.833
Found them!

2:16:35.916 --> 2:16:36.916
Found them!

2:16:40.708 --> 2:16:41.541
<i>Gaysorn.</i>

2:16:41.625 --> 2:16:43.333
Do you hear me?

2:16:43.416 --> 2:16:44.250
Gaysorn!

2:16:45.875 --> 2:16:47.000
She's not breathing.

2:16:47.083 --> 2:16:48.833
We have to give her CPR.

2:16:49.625 --> 2:16:50.750
Put your right hand over your left.

2:16:51.375 --> 2:16:53.291
Press into the middle
of her chest real hard.

2:16:56.208 --> 2:16:57.041
Harder!

2:16:58.958 --> 2:16:59.791
Gaysorn.

2:17:00.375 --> 2:17:01.458
Gaysorn.

2:17:01.541 --> 2:17:02.375
Next.

2:17:02.458 --> 2:17:05.416
Pinch her nose
and blow air into her mouth twice.

2:17:08.666 --> 2:17:09.541
Blow…

2:17:11.291 --> 2:17:13.916
Blow air into her mouth by using my mouth?

2:17:15.791 --> 2:17:16.625
I can't.

2:17:16.708 --> 2:17:17.750
There's no time.

2:17:17.833 --> 2:17:18.958
I'll do it then.

2:17:51.375 --> 2:17:53.416
…if you had never dreamed of me,

2:17:54.083 --> 2:17:56.416
if we were someone who had just met,

2:17:58.583 --> 2:18:01.500
<i>would you still want to marry me?</i>

2:18:43.375 --> 2:18:44.250
Gaysorn.

2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:46.916
Gaysorn.

2:18:53.250 --> 2:18:54.083
Gaysorn.

2:18:54.833 --> 2:18:55.791
Gaysorn.

2:18:57.333 --> 2:18:58.166
Gaysorn.

2:19:26.000 --> 2:19:26.833
Bhop.

2:19:59.500 --> 2:20:00.416
What a waste…

2:20:03.416 --> 2:20:04.666
of the respect

2:20:06.750 --> 2:20:08.416
and trust I had in you.

2:20:10.458 --> 2:20:13.625
Why did you use my name

2:20:14.208 --> 2:20:15.916
to start a coup?

2:20:23.166 --> 2:20:28.875
All that I did was for you, sir.

2:21:40.833 --> 2:21:41.666
Let's go.

2:22:12.875 --> 2:22:16.416
In the name of Siam,
we need to arrest you.

2:22:18.208 --> 2:22:19.750
Please do not resist.

2:22:54.791 --> 2:22:57.208
That pistol probably took you here
for this reason.

2:22:59.541 --> 2:23:00.375
But

2:23:00.958 --> 2:23:04.416
I'm sorry that I lost your pistol.

2:23:11.750 --> 2:23:14.583
God or other sacred beings

2:23:15.666 --> 2:23:17.333
must have wanted the pistol here.

2:23:17.958 --> 2:23:20.541
But the pistol couldn't come on its own.

2:23:21.291 --> 2:23:22.833
So I had to come with it too.

2:23:45.375 --> 2:23:47.250
You really are a good descendant.

2:24:28.541 --> 2:24:34.333
<i>The news from abroad states that
when Mr. Hunter was exiled,</i>

2:24:34.416 --> 2:24:38.833
<i>he sold the steamboat to Cochinchina</i>

2:24:38.916 --> 2:24:41.875
<i>for 67,000 dollars.</i>

2:24:57.416 --> 2:24:58.458
I know

2:24:59.208 --> 2:25:01.250
that you all secretly read the journal.

2:25:02.583 --> 2:25:03.416
But

2:25:04.416 --> 2:25:07.791
I also know
the journal used to belong to you.

2:25:08.750 --> 2:25:09.791
You keep it.

2:25:23.208 --> 2:25:27.333
I probably won't read
Lady Karaket's journal anymore.

2:25:30.375 --> 2:25:32.583
I'm determined to record

2:25:32.666 --> 2:25:35.750
the events of the world
I am living in now.

2:25:35.833 --> 2:25:37.291
In my own way.

2:25:45.625 --> 2:25:48.958
I will record the events of Siam
in my own way as well.

2:25:50.666 --> 2:25:54.041
This is how history is.

2:25:54.125 --> 2:25:55.666
The same event,

2:25:56.750 --> 2:26:00.000
different people recording,
different perspectives.

2:27:44.041 --> 2:27:48.833
LUANG AWUTWISET

2:28:51.166 --> 2:28:52.125
Mathus.

2:28:53.041 --> 2:28:54.333
Mathus.

2:28:54.416 --> 2:28:55.541
Mathus!

2:28:59.500 --> 2:29:00.500
Pei.

2:29:49.916 --> 2:29:52.125
Did Chief Sombatbordi come to our house?

2:29:53.125 --> 2:29:55.583
Yes, but I chased him away.

2:29:55.666 --> 2:29:59.916
He came to confess to me
that he has taken liberties with you.

2:30:00.500 --> 2:30:05.791
He would like to take responsibility
and marry you.

2:30:08.291 --> 2:30:09.125
What?

2:30:19.041 --> 2:30:19.916
Oh, no.

2:30:33.333 --> 2:30:34.375
Hi there!

2:30:35.958 --> 2:30:36.791
Hey!

2:30:42.041 --> 2:30:42.958
Miss.

2:30:44.000 --> 2:30:46.041
May I hitch a ride on your boat?

2:31:00.750 --> 2:31:04.000
Can you please row faster? I'm in a rush.

2:31:13.541 --> 2:31:14.375
Miss.

2:31:14.958 --> 2:31:16.000
Please let me.

2:31:36.791 --> 2:31:38.041
Bhop!

2:31:39.416 --> 2:31:40.791
Bhop.

2:31:41.708 --> 2:31:43.083
Bhop!

2:31:46.833 --> 2:31:47.666
Bhop!

2:31:48.500 --> 2:31:49.416
Bhop!

2:31:50.916 --> 2:31:52.458
Bhop!

2:31:56.500 --> 2:31:57.833
Bhop!

2:32:00.666 --> 2:32:02.000
Bhop!

2:32:17.250 --> 2:32:18.208
Don't you

2:32:18.833 --> 2:32:20.916
have any flowers for me today?

2:32:34.000 --> 2:32:35.250
A kafferboom.

2:32:36.916 --> 2:32:38.166
I collected from thy house.

2:32:48.833 --> 2:32:50.416
Did you know?

2:32:51.416 --> 2:32:53.125
People in the old days said

2:32:54.583 --> 2:32:58.791
whoever smells the kafferboom
will remember their past life.

2:33:01.875 --> 2:33:02.708
I know.

2:33:05.708 --> 2:33:08.041
Which is why I've never given thee one.

2:33:15.416 --> 2:33:19.750
That day I drowned, I dreamed and saw

2:33:21.625 --> 2:33:24.416
that our past lives together was real.

2:33:28.583 --> 2:33:30.416
I was Lady Karaket.

2:33:32.125 --> 2:33:34.333
You were Khun Sriwisarnwaja.

2:33:47.041 --> 2:33:48.041
All right.

2:33:48.708 --> 2:33:50.458
Us two will leave now.

2:34:06.125 --> 2:34:08.166
Do you believe what I said?

2:34:10.166 --> 2:34:13.583
Whether I believe it or not,
it's not important anymore.

2:34:16.708 --> 2:34:18.333
Because ever since I've met thee,

2:34:20.250 --> 2:34:22.666
I've never dreamed of Lady Karaket again.

2:34:27.541 --> 2:34:31.125
Because the person I think of is thee.

2:34:34.666 --> 2:34:36.958
The person who I love in this life.

2:35:05.916 --> 2:35:10.125
The photograph will be evidence
we can leave for our children

2:35:10.208 --> 2:35:14.541
that the times we were together are real.

2:35:15.250 --> 2:35:18.500
But the locals are saying

2:35:19.083 --> 2:35:20.958
this box pulls souls into it.

2:35:21.875 --> 2:35:27.125
How about I draw ten pictures of thee
to make up for it?

2:35:29.125 --> 2:35:31.291
You don't have to be afraid.

2:35:31.916 --> 2:35:34.041
If this box pulls souls into it…

2:35:39.583 --> 2:35:41.291
I will go with you.

2:35:49.416 --> 2:35:50.916
Stand still.

2:35:53.083 --> 2:35:55.500
<i>One, two, three.</i>

2:35:57.916 --> 2:35:59.541
My dej-ti-ny.

2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:39.958
Right here, uncle.

2:37:40.458 --> 2:37:41.291
I remember.

2:37:42.041 --> 2:37:44.416
In my last life,
I buried it with my own hands.

2:37:46.375 --> 2:37:48.750
An angel told me in my dream.

2:37:49.916 --> 2:37:53.208
I wasn't worthy of protecting it.

2:37:54.541 --> 2:37:57.958
It should be kept
underneath Ayutthaya soil.

2:38:00.166 --> 2:38:01.458
For the future.

2:38:15.208 --> 2:38:17.291
2022

2:38:21.333 --> 2:38:23.291
PUTTARN_PT

2:38:25.166 --> 2:38:26.000
Miss Puttarn.

2:38:27.166 --> 2:38:28.125
Will you come take a look over here?
