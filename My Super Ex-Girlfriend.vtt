01:36.603 --> 01:38.980
- Move!
- Let's go, let's go!

01:58.375 --> 02:01.086
We did it, right?

02:02.879 --> 02:04.965
Whoa! What the hell are you doing?

02:16.809 --> 02:20.521
- G-Girl!
- It's G-Girl!

02:24.108 --> 02:26.068
Gun!

02:38.497 --> 02:42.960
G-Girl! G-Girl! G-Girl! G-Girl!

02:55.054 --> 03:01.436
Wow. If you could have any superpower,
what would it be?

03:01.519 --> 03:04.522
The ability to blow myself.

03:05.690 --> 03:07.483
That's quite a visual.

03:07.567 --> 03:10.445
- But wouldn't it seem a little...
- Gay?

03:10.528 --> 03:15.116
- No, not at all. Think about it.
- Yeah, really? It seems that way.

03:15.199 --> 03:17.452
Oh, dude. Check her out.

03:17.535 --> 03:19.120
Ooh. Wow.

03:19.203 --> 03:23.249
What do we have here?
Kind of uptight librarian on the outside,

03:23.333 --> 03:25.542
ready to rumble on the inside.

03:25.626 --> 03:28.462
- Go ask her out.
- No. I'm not ready yet. I can't.

03:28.545 --> 03:30.589
Oh, Matt. You're killing me.

03:30.672 --> 03:34.801
Your last insane girlfriend dumped you,
like, six months ago.

03:34.885 --> 03:37.971
I would have ploughed my way
through half of SoHo by now.

03:38.055 --> 03:40.849
That's cos you're soulless and shallow.

03:40.933 --> 03:42.935
It is a blessing.

03:43.018 --> 03:45.729
Go over there. Talk to her. Do it.

03:45.812 --> 03:49.233
- Matt, say hi. Give me your bag. Come on.
- OK, OK.

03:49.316 --> 03:51.318
Yes.

03:51.401 --> 03:54.029
All out. Be strong. Breathe.

03:55.113 --> 03:57.199
Eye of the tiger.

04:01.077 --> 04:02.495
Hi.

04:02.578 --> 04:07.792
Excuse me. I know I don't really know you,
but you look like a very interesting person,

04:07.875 --> 04:10.545
so at the risk of totally
humiliating myself,

04:10.628 --> 04:13.548
I thought perhaps sometime
I might buy you a cup...

04:13.631 --> 04:15.716
No!

04:25.851 --> 04:30.356
It doesn't have to be a cup of coffee. It could
be whatever you want. A cup of anything.

04:30.439 --> 04:32.775
Juice? Hey!

04:34.402 --> 04:36.486
Hey!

04:39.990 --> 04:42.075
Hey!

04:55.046 --> 04:56.172
Hey!

04:56.256 --> 04:58.717
Somebody stop that guy!

05:08.643 --> 05:11.688
That's right. You better run, asshole!

05:11.771 --> 05:17.192
Keep running, my man!
You don't want any of this. Keep running.

05:18.444 --> 05:20.696
Yeah!

05:22.114 --> 05:24.450
- What did you call me?
- Oh, shit!

05:24.533 --> 05:26.619
What did you call me?

05:39.590 --> 05:41.675
Idiot.

05:42.927 --> 05:45.638
Come on! Get out of there.

05:45.721 --> 05:50.141
Let's go! I know you're in there.
Get out of there!

05:50.808 --> 05:52.894
Whoa!

06:01.527 --> 06:03.613
Hey. How about it, huh?

06:04.614 --> 06:09.827
So how about that cup of coffee?
Or it could be something more substantial.

06:09.911 --> 06:13.164
- Like dinner?
- Yeah. That'd be great.

06:13.248 --> 06:15.250
- Matt Saunders.
- Jenny Johnson.

06:15.333 --> 06:19.837
Jenny Johnson. Wonderful name.
You got the whole alliteration thing going.

06:19.921 --> 06:22.549
I grew up with a guy named
Francis Freddie Friedman.

06:22.632 --> 06:27.511
A bit of a klepto, not the kind of guy you'd
want over if you had spare cash laying out.

06:27.594 --> 06:29.304
Yeah, right. Right.

06:29.388 --> 06:32.224
So, um... May I get your number?

06:32.307 --> 06:37.145
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't give it out.
Privacy issues. I'll take yours, though.

06:37.229 --> 06:39.773
- OK. Actually, I don't think I have a pen.
- I do.

06:39.856 --> 06:43.402
Thanks. Isn't this something women do
just to blow off losers?

06:43.485 --> 06:45.737
Yes, women do do that.

06:45.821 --> 06:48.949
But that's not how I blow off losers.

07:03.671 --> 07:05.840
Hey, Saunders, heads up.

07:06.841 --> 07:10.887
- Oh, you have bad reflexes.
- You know, you're a danger in the workplace.

07:10.970 --> 07:14.390
Do you have the bathroom layouts
for the Beijing presentation?

07:14.473 --> 07:19.228
- I'll take a look at those.
- I finished them up last night.

07:20.813 --> 07:23.316
- Hey, Hannah.
- Hey, Vaughn.

07:27.528 --> 07:29.363
- Looks good.
- Thank you.

07:29.447 --> 07:31.657
What about... Is this OK?

07:31.741 --> 07:35.161
It's a bit tight,
but I talked to the structural engineer...

07:35.244 --> 07:38.788
- How's your boyfriend? Isn't his name Rick?
- Steve. He's good.

07:38.872 --> 07:41.499
He just got back from Milan. Look at this.

07:41.583 --> 07:45.879
- Milan?
- Yes, his new Joe Boxer ad campaign.

07:45.962 --> 07:49.674
Wow. He's buff. Are you into that?

07:49.758 --> 07:54.054
I would think this is more your style.
What do you think?

07:54.137 --> 07:59.434
Two months in a gym, a personal trainer and the
right steroids, I look like that or better.

08:00.518 --> 08:02.687
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

08:05.273 --> 08:07.609
- What are you doing?!
- Huh?

08:07.692 --> 08:12.489
Hey, Carla. Nothing. Just reshelving some
reference material, trying to stay ahead.

08:12.572 --> 08:15.991
- You were staring at her butt.
- He was?

08:16.075 --> 08:19.119
- No. No, I was not.
- Yes, he was.

08:19.203 --> 08:23.290
Hannah, as you know, we have
a zero-tolerance policy for this behavior.

08:23.374 --> 08:26.627
I actually read that memo twice. I got it.

08:26.710 --> 08:28.879
You should be familiar with this part.

08:28.963 --> 08:31.590
Would you like to file a grievance
at this time?

08:31.674 --> 08:35.719
Um... I don't think so, Carla.

08:35.803 --> 08:40.599
Because, as your supervisor, I am officially
giving you that opportunity right now.

08:40.683 --> 08:45.896
And I thank you for that, but I think
I'm just gonna let this one slide.

08:45.980 --> 08:48.607
That's completely your decision.

08:48.691 --> 08:53.361
- Will you sign a statement to that effect?
- Sure. Yes.

08:54.696 --> 09:00.451
You are lucky this time, Mr.
Bottom Watcher.

09:00.535 --> 09:04.539
- Hello?
- Matt? Hey. It's Jenny Johnson.

09:04.622 --> 09:09.127
- Hey, Jenny. I wasn't sure I'd hear from you.
- So are we still on for dinner?

09:09.210 --> 09:13.381
- Dinner? Absolutely. That sounds great.
- Is that a girl? A real, live girl?

09:13.464 --> 09:17.552
A great new Indian place on Madison
just opened up. Eight o'clock?

09:17.635 --> 09:20.638
Indian? Love it. I'll
see you tomorrow night.

09:20.722 --> 09:22.765
OK. Great. See you. Bye.

09:23.725 --> 09:26.310
Saunders! Do you have a date?

09:26.393 --> 09:29.313
Got a date. And it's a hot one.

09:32.524 --> 09:35.986
So the assistant curator job's
really perfect for me.

09:36.320 --> 09:40.657
I was an art history major in college.
It's the only thing I'm good at.

09:40.741 --> 09:45.495
At least, the only thing I'm good at
I can make any money off.

09:45.579 --> 09:49.875
- That sounded like I was talking about sex.
- No. No, it didn't.

09:49.958 --> 09:52.252
Believe me, I didn't mean sex.

09:52.336 --> 09:55.547
- I mean, I am good at sex.
- I'm sure you are.

09:55.631 --> 09:57.966
- Now it sounds like I'm bragging.
- No, no.

09:58.050 --> 10:03.346
I think I'm good at sex.
I don't know, you decide.

10:04.222 --> 10:05.973
Me?

10:06.057 --> 10:08.893
But not tonight. It's our first date.

10:10.895 --> 10:12.980
Yeah.

10:14.065 --> 10:16.442
So what do you do?

10:16.525 --> 10:20.112
I'm a project manager at a design firm.

10:20.196 --> 10:25.076
We design and build private estates,
libraries, hotels, that sort of thing.

10:25.159 --> 10:30.039
Yeah, right now, we're...

10:41.049 --> 10:44.719
- I'm sorry. Am I bothering you?
- What?

10:44.803 --> 10:47.389
No. No. Um...

10:48.223 --> 10:51.768
I was just trying to listen to something.

10:53.061 --> 10:55.438
I don't hear anything.

10:55.522 --> 10:58.358
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
I have to go to the bathroom.

10:58.441 --> 11:00.527
Sure.

11:20.296 --> 11:25.426
- Yo, how's it going?
- Well, she's a talker, yeah.

11:25.509 --> 11:29.889
- Only question is, will you sleep with her?
- That's the only question, huh?

11:29.972 --> 11:34.560
Yes. I'm not just talking about your date
tonight. I am talking about life in general.

11:34.643 --> 11:39.315
- That is the only question.
- What's going on there?

11:39.398 --> 11:43.986
Uh, some big fire at 73rd and Broadway.
Everything's burning.

11:44.069 --> 11:46.363
- Is anyone hurt?
- I don't know. Probably.

11:46.447 --> 11:48.574
It's blocking my way to the gym.

11:48.657 --> 11:51.451
My thoughts are with you
in this time of crisis.

11:54.162 --> 11:56.706
Wow! Oh, man!

11:57.540 --> 12:02.086
- What's going on?
- It's G-Girl! She's doing her thing.

12:02.962 --> 12:06.758
Are you serious? You lucky SOB.
I've never even seen her in person.

12:06.841 --> 12:08.927
How does she look?

12:10.053 --> 12:12.138
She looks...

12:13.056 --> 12:17.060
- What?
- Blurry. But still pretty hot.

12:17.143 --> 12:20.188
Yeah? What's she doing now?

12:20.271 --> 12:25.693
She's spinning around
like one of those things that spins.

12:25.777 --> 12:28.654
Amazing. That's unbelievable.

12:28.737 --> 12:30.822
Yeah. It's so cool.

12:38.330 --> 12:40.499
Oh!

12:40.582 --> 12:45.003
Yes. That's it, show's over.
She put the fire out. Fantastic.

12:45.087 --> 12:50.259
G-Girl! G-Girl!
G-Girl! G-Girl! G-Girl!

12:50.342 --> 12:52.511
Oh! OK.

12:52.594 --> 12:56.473
And she's gone.
Flew off into the sunset. Amazing.

12:56.557 --> 13:00.394
Unbelievable. Hey, why do you think
they call her G-Girl?

13:00.477 --> 13:05.815
I don't know, like, "gorgeous" or
"G-force"? I'm not really sure.

13:05.898 --> 13:08.234
What do you think about "good kisser"?

13:08.317 --> 13:11.153
I can't believe I missed that.
I'm eating Indian food.

13:11.237 --> 13:14.115
Oh, wait, no, no. "Goddess woman".

13:14.198 --> 13:17.201
- What about "G-spot"?
- I gotta go. Bye.

13:18.369 --> 13:20.288
Whoo!

13:20.371 --> 13:25.334
Huge line. Sorry.
It was a really, really long line.

13:25.418 --> 13:29.964
- You got a little something on your chin.
- What? Oh. Oh.

13:30.047 --> 13:34.343
- I hate when that happens.
- When what happens?

13:34.427 --> 13:36.512
Mystery smudges.

13:36.596 --> 13:41.391
- Gotta go to the bathroom.
- Um... You didn't just go to the bathroom?

13:43.226 --> 13:47.439
Are you keeping track?
That's kind of creepy.

13:47.772 --> 13:51.735
- She sounds like a nutcase.
- So you're saying she's perfect for me?

13:51.818 --> 13:54.112
Crazy women are attracted to you.

13:54.446 --> 13:56.281
It's like you give off a scent.

13:56.364 --> 13:58.450
You should do a background check on her.

13:58.533 --> 14:02.204
What do you think? Shall we
keep these walls brick or make it stucco?

14:02.287 --> 14:05.498
- Did you kick the plug?
- I don't know.

14:06.958 --> 14:09.669
- Let me handle this one.
- All right.

14:10.629 --> 14:13.715
- Don't do that.
- Don't do what? What are you talking about?

14:13.798 --> 14:15.383
You mean this?

14:15.467 --> 14:16.800
Hey!

14:16.884 --> 14:21.805
Sexual harassment's a two-way street. Don't
think cos I'm a guy you can manhandle me.

14:21.889 --> 14:24.683
Hey! What the hell's going on here?

14:24.767 --> 14:27.186
- Oh, no. Sorry, her...
- Steve.

14:27.269 --> 14:30.064
Her computer had gone down.
I was plugging it back in.

14:30.147 --> 14:34.318
- I'm screwing with you. I'm not worried.
- Oh. None taken.

14:34.401 --> 14:37.488
- I missed you.
- I missed you too.

14:37.571 --> 14:39.949
- Not here!
- Sorry.

14:40.950 --> 14:46.539
See, Saunders? You need to be with someone
who appreciates you, like Steve here.

14:46.622 --> 14:51.168
Yeah. I'm looking for Mr. Right. Haven't
found him yet, though. Not given up.

14:51.252 --> 14:57.799
- Steve Ballard. Nice to meet you.
- This is Matt. You've met him, like, five times.

14:57.882 --> 15:02.512
- Oh, right, right. Sorry.
- It's OK. I'm a very forgettable person.

15:02.595 --> 15:06.599
When I was growing up, I'd come down
to breakfast and Mom would scream,

15:06.683 --> 15:08.810
call the cops on me.

15:08.893 --> 15:11.855
- It's a joke, right? Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:11.938 --> 15:16.442
- It's a good one. Got me back.
- Hey, baby, we should be going to lunch.

15:16.526 --> 15:21.698
Hey, Saunders, that woman is trouble.
Do not call her.

15:27.620 --> 15:30.455
- OK, we're done.
- What happened? We just started.

15:30.539 --> 15:33.083
That's it. No. I got a twinge.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.586
Dude, you should definitely call her back.

15:35.669 --> 15:38.881
- Yeah? You think I should?
- Oh, yeah.

15:39.965 --> 15:42.301
Cos she's good to go.

15:42.384 --> 15:45.762
And you haven't gone in six months.

15:48.765 --> 15:51.602
Oh, yes. Plus, what's the downside?

15:51.685 --> 15:58.609
I don't know. She seems a little, uh...
She's neurotic, you know. And distant.

15:58.692 --> 16:03.113
That's good. That's a good thing.
Neurotic and distant is a very good thing.

16:03.197 --> 16:06.657
Yeah, neurotic women are hellcats in bed.

16:08.534 --> 16:11.829
Plus, if she's distant,
you're both in it for the same thing.

16:11.913 --> 16:14.207
Coitus maximus.

16:15.124 --> 16:20.796
There's no, "Could she be the one? I'm falling
hard for her" kind of crap to get in the way.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.591
It's just pure carnal nirvana.

16:23.674 --> 16:27.887
- Your argument's repugnant and intriguing.
- That's kind of my thing.

16:43.652 --> 16:46.947
- Oh, hey.
- Hi. Oh, wow. Thank you.

16:47.030 --> 16:48.823
- You're welcome.
- A rose.

16:48.907 --> 16:51.618
Different color roses
mean different things.

16:51.701 --> 16:55.872
Red ones mean passion or love,
so this is great.

16:55.956 --> 16:59.209
But I'm not saying I think
you're telling me that you love me.

16:59.292 --> 17:01.586
I mean, it's absurdly early for that.

17:01.670 --> 17:04.506
But you never know. Maybe someday.

17:04.589 --> 17:07.425
Or never. No pressure.

17:08.760 --> 17:11.179
Let me get us a cab. Taxi.

17:12.222 --> 17:14.307
Taxi!

17:20.145 --> 17:22.231
Hey, it's stopping.

17:26.402 --> 17:28.988
Here we go.

17:29.071 --> 17:31.240
You OK?

17:31.323 --> 17:34.076
At least we got a ride.

17:34.159 --> 17:36.787
Can we stop by the gallery?
We opened a new show.

17:36.871 --> 17:40.583
Sounds great.
Hey, thanks for stopping. Appreciate it.

17:45.629 --> 17:47.715
Wow.

17:50.759 --> 17:53.344
Wonder what she's looking at.

17:58.516 --> 18:01.019
Ouch! That's gotta hurt.

18:03.271 --> 18:05.356
So what do you think?

18:05.440 --> 18:09.527
It's interesting. And a little disturbing.

18:10.778 --> 18:16.618
I know. It's surprising
how frightening things attract us.

18:16.701 --> 18:22.957
Matt, I have to help people every day,
and nobody's ever helped me except you.

18:24.375 --> 18:26.461
You're my hero.

18:40.849 --> 18:44.353
I'm sorry. What is it? Tell me.

18:44.436 --> 18:48.273
It's your tongue. You're
using it all wrong.

18:49.942 --> 18:54.029
- What are you talking about?
- You shouldn't stick it out like a dead fish.

18:54.112 --> 18:57.032
You're supposed to flick it a little.

18:57.115 --> 19:00.452
I think that I was flicking it, wasn't I?
I was doing that.

19:00.536 --> 19:03.163
- No. Not enough.
- Really?

19:03.247 --> 19:06.666
I'm not used to having my tongue skills
critiqued like this, OK?

19:06.749 --> 19:09.043
Maybe not to your face.

19:09.794 --> 19:11.879
Oh, man.

19:12.838 --> 19:14.924
Let me help you.

19:16.509 --> 19:19.136
Close your eyes.

19:20.763 --> 19:22.849
Now do what I do.

19:38.072 --> 19:43.118
So, uh... this is my place.
I redesigned the space when I bought it.

19:43.201 --> 19:44.995
- It's nice.
- Thank you.

19:45.078 --> 19:47.956
This is the dining room.
Doesn't get a lot of use.

19:48.039 --> 19:50.709
- Well, I could help with that.
- OK.

19:50.792 --> 19:54.170
This is my fish. That's Biggie Smalls.

19:54.254 --> 19:56.423
Hi, Biggie.

19:56.506 --> 20:00.051
He's... he's never met a woman before.

20:01.052 --> 20:03.847
Well, he's about to get an eyeful.

20:11.188 --> 20:14.441
- Will you show me the rest of your place?
- OK.

20:14.524 --> 20:17.194
I'll take you over to the kitchen.

20:17.277 --> 20:23.282
That's the refrigerator.
I can get you a juice, a beer.

20:23.365 --> 20:25.993
I'll make you anything. Yeah.

20:30.831 --> 20:32.917
I'm not thirsty either.

20:35.211 --> 20:38.797
- And this is the, uh...
- Bed.

20:43.177 --> 20:45.471
Oh, that's a great sweater. Wow.

20:45.554 --> 20:50.017
What a blouse.
Let me help with those buttons.

20:53.437 --> 20:59.567
- I'm sorry. I need the, um...
- Oh, yeah. The bathroom? It's right there.

21:00.777 --> 21:03.238
She goes to the bathroom a lot.

21:21.548 --> 21:23.967
I'm ready.

21:24.050 --> 21:27.971
That's what I call structural integrity.

21:28.054 --> 21:32.474
All right! You should have
been dressed like that all night.

21:32.558 --> 21:34.810
You look great.

21:36.103 --> 21:38.689
Let me help you with this.

21:38.772 --> 21:40.858
Ooh.

21:41.775 --> 21:44.987
- I must be a little nervous.
- It's OK.

21:45.070 --> 21:48.198
I got a closet full of 'em.
Let me handle this one, though.

21:48.282 --> 21:50.659
- Let's take care of these.
- OK.

21:54.538 --> 21:56.623
Thanks.

22:01.044 --> 22:05.257
Who'd have thought we'd have ended up
like this after that day on the subway?

22:05.340 --> 22:07.800
Ain't life grand?

22:10.303 --> 22:12.388
- Matt?
- Yeah?

22:13.222 --> 22:15.725
Do you mind if I get on top?

22:15.808 --> 22:18.686
Trust me, it's better that way.

22:18.769 --> 22:20.855
10-4.

22:26.485 --> 22:28.279
Are you ready?

22:29.488 --> 22:32.283
- OK.
- OK.

22:32.366 --> 22:34.660
Here we go.

22:41.125 --> 22:43.210
Wow.

22:50.133 --> 22:52.552
OK, I get it.

22:53.345 --> 22:55.597
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:59.768 --> 23:01.853
Whoo! Whoo!

23:03.855 --> 23:05.941
Oh, goddamn!

23:08.068 --> 23:10.403
OK, now I need a break.

23:13.490 --> 23:15.575
Agh!

23:21.539 --> 23:24.750
I'm sorry. I'll get you a new one.

23:24.833 --> 23:28.712
- A bed or a penis?
- Both.

23:39.932 --> 23:43.435
♪ Some people call me the space cowboy

23:45.563 --> 23:49.108
♪ Some people call me the gangster of love

23:49.817 --> 23:50.943
♪ Yeah

23:51.026 --> 23:54.572
♪ Some people walking around
calling me Maurice

23:54.655 --> 23:59.951
There are three moments
I will remember until the day I die.

24:00.034 --> 24:05.415
One, the look on my father's face
when I graduated from Harvard Law School.

24:05.498 --> 24:10.712
Two, helping a beached
mother whale give birth.

24:11.838 --> 24:14.507
And three,

24:15.466 --> 24:19.846
you and me together, here, tonight.

24:20.722 --> 24:23.725
Don't speak to me again, ever.

24:25.393 --> 24:27.478
Uh-oh. Oh, no.

24:27.562 --> 24:29.689
Water, please. Got a big night.

24:29.772 --> 24:31.481
No, no, no.

24:31.565 --> 24:36.236
Don't tell me. You have invaded the
female nation and spread your democracy.

24:36.320 --> 24:39.823
What can I say? She's completely
different than I thought she was.

24:39.907 --> 24:43.035
- Hot, though, right?
- Unbelievably hot.

24:43.118 --> 24:47.289
I don't even know if I should tell you
this. I don't know if you can handle it.

24:47.372 --> 24:50.209
I can handle it. Please?

24:50.292 --> 24:53.921
- She broke my bed.
- Wow.

24:54.004 --> 24:56.298
Busted it to pieces.

24:56.381 --> 24:59.551
- And that's a good thing, right?
- Yeah. That's a good thing.

24:59.635 --> 25:03.055
- I'm gonna see her again today.
- What are you talking about?

25:03.138 --> 25:05.766
No! You have sex with her once
and then you move on.

25:05.849 --> 25:10.520
Not if you get on the greatest ever roller
coaster, you don't. You get back in that line.

25:10.603 --> 25:14.774
Get in line, ride two or three more times,
throw your hands in the air and scream.

25:14.857 --> 25:17.026
But soon you're gonna end up nauseous.

25:17.109 --> 25:19.111
Hey, guys.

25:19.195 --> 25:23.407
- How are you guys doing?
- Keep that safety bar clamped down.

25:23.491 --> 25:27.787
OK, I think you are gonna like this.
I have a little present for you, Saunders.

25:27.870 --> 25:31.582
- Anything for me there?
- No. No, Vaughn.

25:31.666 --> 25:33.584
- You have nice ears.
- Thank you.

25:33.668 --> 25:36.462
- No lobes, though.
- An imperfection. We all got 'em.

25:36.546 --> 25:42.635
Not me. Hey, so I downloaded some Chinese
phrases for you, for the presentation.

25:42.718 --> 25:45.762
- What do you think? Thought it might help.
- That's great.

25:45.846 --> 25:48.890
- I thought it would help.
- You're the best, you know that?

25:48.974 --> 25:50.475
I know. I am.

25:50.559 --> 25:53.353
Well, I gotta get going.
I'm going to see Jenny.

25:53.436 --> 25:56.356
- You're seeing Jenny? Again?
- Yeah. Yeah.

25:56.439 --> 26:00.569
- Oh. Things must really be going well.
- She broke his bed.

26:00.652 --> 26:03.405
Thanks. That was really thoughtful of you.

26:03.488 --> 26:06.324
- Oh, no problem.
- I'll see you two later.

26:06.408 --> 26:08.451
- See you, Matt.
- Look after her, OK?

26:08.535 --> 26:10.453
I will.

26:10.537 --> 26:15.083
- Man, he's seeing Jenny again?
- Just a few more times.

26:23.090 --> 26:28.929
- Matt Saunders? We're gonna take a ride.
- Wait a second! Hey! Wait!

26:32.975 --> 26:37.855
Hey, now, look.
I don't appreciate being manhandled...

26:37.938 --> 26:40.232
What's going on?

26:41.192 --> 26:46.322
- Mr. Saunders, thank you for your time.
- OK. Now, who are you?

26:46.405 --> 26:50.743
Who am I? Do you watch television,
Mr. Saunders? Read the papers?

26:50.826 --> 26:54.163
- Use the net for anything other than porn?
- You're that Bedlam guy.

26:54.246 --> 26:57.207
- Professor Bedlam.
- The "supervillain".

26:57.290 --> 27:01.461
Please, I am not super, I am not a villain.
I'm just a regular man, like yourself,

27:01.544 --> 27:06.007
with 10,000 times more money,
intelligence and taste.

27:06.925 --> 27:09.969
OK, so what do you want from me?

27:10.053 --> 27:12.972
Are you seeing anyone, Mr. Saunders?

27:13.806 --> 27:16.935
Are you asking me out? Ow!

27:17.018 --> 27:22.482
I want you to tell me everything you know
about your new girlfriend.

27:22.565 --> 27:25.902
- Jenny?
- Yes. Jenny.

27:25.985 --> 27:28.780
Where does she like to go?
What does she like to do?

27:28.863 --> 27:31.866
What music does she listen to?
Is she afraid of bugs?

27:31.950 --> 27:34.284
Is she a dog person or a cat person?

27:34.368 --> 27:37.955
- Does she wear panties...
- OK, now, look. Hold on just a goddamn...

27:38.038 --> 27:42.584
Now, look. It's gotta stop
with the slapping, all right?!

27:42.668 --> 27:49.800
I just don't feel real comfortable telling you,
a total stranger, someone's private habits.

27:49.883 --> 27:52.594
You gotta understand that, right?

27:52.678 --> 27:54.513
Of course.

28:00.394 --> 28:03.480
Please, someone! Help! Help!

28:03.564 --> 28:05.107
Save me! Please!

28:17.785 --> 28:19.871
Weasel!

28:29.589 --> 28:32.758
Hey! Help! Yeah, you! You!

28:32.842 --> 28:35.136
Get somebody from the Park Service!

28:35.219 --> 28:37.180
Oh, jeez!

28:37.263 --> 28:40.266
No! Help me! Oh, no!

28:41.642 --> 28:43.686
Oh, my God!

28:51.776 --> 28:55.322
- G-Girl! G-Girl, you saved me. Thank you!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:55.405 --> 28:57.991
- Whoa! Hold me! Hold me!
- Don't look at me!

28:58.074 --> 29:00.285
- But I just wanted to...
- Don't look at me!

29:00.368 --> 29:03.079
OK, yeah. No looking. Got you. Roger.

29:10.754 --> 29:12.797
Wow.

29:13.632 --> 29:19.513
Looks like little Jenny's
been cashing in on her superpowers.

29:19.596 --> 29:23.557
Idiot! We don't want her to know
we dropped by.

29:25.935 --> 29:28.020
Ah.

29:37.238 --> 29:39.114
Perfect.

29:42.368 --> 29:45.412
So I'm falling,
I mean, hurdling through the sky.

29:45.496 --> 29:48.624
And just as I'm about to bite it,
and I mean out of nowhere,

29:48.707 --> 29:52.211
she just catches me
and sets me right on the ground.

29:52.294 --> 29:55.130
It was unbelievable.
The weird thing is, though,

29:55.214 --> 29:57.924
that Bedlam guy,
he kept asking me about you.

29:58.007 --> 30:00.677
- Do you know him?
- No, how could I know him?

30:00.760 --> 30:03.638
- That's what I was thinking.
- So what was she like?

30:03.721 --> 30:05.014
G-Girl?

30:06.015 --> 30:09.727
I didn't really get a good look at her,
but to tell you the truth,

30:09.811 --> 30:13.106
- she wasn't really what I expected, you know.
- In what way?

30:13.189 --> 30:16.359
- I don't know. She just seemed a little...
- Brainy?

30:16.442 --> 30:19.529
- Not really.
- Exotic? Effervescent?

30:19.612 --> 30:22.157
No, I kind of got this vibe
she was a little nuts.

30:22.240 --> 30:26.035
Nuts?! Maybe she was a
little bit preoccupied,

30:26.119 --> 30:28.580
having searched the entire city to save you

30:28.663 --> 30:32.876
from being squished like a bug
on a windshield!

30:32.959 --> 30:36.211
You girls all really stick
together, don't you?

30:36.295 --> 30:38.797
I like it. You're like one big gang.

30:47.681 --> 30:51.602
- Rule number one about crossing the street?
- Look both ways.

30:51.685 --> 30:54.563
That's right.

30:54.646 --> 30:56.773
Jenny!

30:59.776 --> 31:04.698
- One of you call 911!
- I'm fine. I'm fine. That was close.

31:04.781 --> 31:06.492
I'm fine, I'm fine.

31:06.575 --> 31:10.703
- You're not fine. How can you be fine?
- Look, Matt, I can walk.

31:10.786 --> 31:14.457
Don't move. You probably have
internal bleeding and don't know it.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.834
- No, not even a scratch.
- You are in shock.

31:16.918 --> 31:21.380
Did anyone see this? It's like a miracle.
Truly, it's like a miracle.

31:23.674 --> 31:28.471
I mean, are you sure that you're OK?
I mean, you seem to be walking fine.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.515
Yeah.

31:31.349 --> 31:34.852
This is the first time
that I've ever brought anybody here.

31:34.936 --> 31:37.063
- Ever.
- Really? Wow.

31:37.396 --> 31:41.400
Yeah, it seems like a really great place.

31:41.484 --> 31:45.279
I'm still just kind of wondering
what the hell happened out there.

31:45.363 --> 31:47.280
I know.

31:47.364 --> 31:52.285
I didn't expect to do this.
At least, not yet anyway.

31:52.369 --> 31:56.540
- But it's good. It's good.
- OK.

31:56.623 --> 32:00.710
Cos what we have is so very, very special.

32:01.878 --> 32:03.964
- I trust you.
- OK.

32:04.047 --> 32:07.008
There should be nothing hanging between us.

32:07.092 --> 32:10.136
Especially not this, don't you think?

32:11.137 --> 32:14.307
I don't know what you're talking about.

32:14.391 --> 32:17.561
I'll have to show you.

32:30.447 --> 32:35.703
You look nice without your glasses.
You look good with them too.

32:36.871 --> 32:39.206
I'll hold them for you.

32:40.708 --> 32:41.625
OK...

32:41.709 --> 32:45.880
I don't know what the explanation is,
but I like it already.

32:45.963 --> 32:52.052
Unless it's one of those Crying Game things?
It's not that, is it? I mean, I'm from Denver.

32:52.136 --> 32:54.597
Just wait.

32:56.765 --> 33:01.102
You got a G-Girl costume on.
That's...

33:01.186 --> 33:03.980
Kind of went all out, didn't you?

33:07.484 --> 33:09.652
And you even dyed your...

33:13.406 --> 33:15.700
Oh.

33:15.783 --> 33:17.869
Wow!

33:19.954 --> 33:22.040
Are you kidding me?

33:23.583 --> 33:27.962
Oh, man. This is incredible.

33:28.046 --> 33:31.174
- But you can't tell anyone!
- Yeah, nobody except Vaughn.

33:31.257 --> 33:34.885
He slept with a Victoria's Secret model,
I've never heard the end of it.

33:34.968 --> 33:37.638
- This will blow that out of the water.
- No! Nobody.

33:37.721 --> 33:40.974
Matt, you have to promise me
you'll never, ever tell anyone.

33:41.058 --> 33:46.104
- Fine, you got it.
- No matter what, you will never tell anyone.

33:46.188 --> 33:48.315
Hey, I swear.

33:48.398 --> 33:52.611
Say you'd rather have a chain saw
shoved up your ass than tell.

33:52.694 --> 33:55.030
- Is that actually a possibility?
- Say it!

33:55.113 --> 33:59.201
I'd rather have a chain saw
shoved up my ass than tell.

33:59.284 --> 34:00.911
OK.

34:00.994 --> 34:04.414
So this Bedlam guy, he's like
your arch nemesis or something?

34:04.498 --> 34:09.293
Uh-huh. He's been a pain in the butt ever
since we had this falling out in high school.

34:09.378 --> 34:11.712
- You guys went to school together?
- Mm-hm.

34:11.795 --> 34:13.255
Wow.

34:13.339 --> 34:16.300
By the way, his name's not really Bedlam.

34:16.384 --> 34:21.179
It's Barry. Barry Edward Lambert.
Bedlam, get it?

34:23.266 --> 34:27.395
Back then, we were both kind of outcasts.
Everybody else hated us.

34:27.478 --> 34:30.481
Nerd alert! Here come the geeks.

34:32.733 --> 34:36.404
So we looked out for each other.

34:36.487 --> 34:41.159
It's only natural
that we spent a lot of time together.

34:46.371 --> 34:48.540
We really liked each other.

34:49.081 --> 34:51.251
It was close to the end of our junior year

34:51.333 --> 34:55.172
when I decided it was about time
to get the virginity thing over with.

34:55.255 --> 34:58.008
I mean, Barry was harmless enough.

34:59.009 --> 35:02.179
I figured it might as well be him, right?

35:03.138 --> 35:06.474
He was having some trouble
getting his pants off.

35:06.558 --> 35:09.060
And that's when it happened.

35:10.395 --> 35:11.897
Jenny!

35:18.236 --> 35:22.032
Come on!

35:22.782 --> 35:25.576
This is not how I planned this evening.

35:25.659 --> 35:27.995
Oh, my God. Look at that.

35:34.543 --> 35:37.129
It's so cool.

35:38.422 --> 35:42.760
- What are you doing?
- Isn't it amazing?

35:42.843 --> 35:44.970
Don't. It could be dangerous.

36:54.246 --> 36:57.082
When I got back to school,
even with a wig,

36:57.166 --> 37:00.294
people noticed
there was something different about me.

37:00.377 --> 37:02.921
Hi, girls. Ooh, my glasses.

37:03.005 --> 37:05.507
And it worked for me.

37:07.634 --> 37:09.845
Hey.

37:09.928 --> 37:11.471
Ugh!

37:12.847 --> 37:16.934
Unfortunately, Barry and I grew apart.

37:17.018 --> 37:19.312
He stopped talking to me.

37:19.395 --> 37:21.898
And then ignored me totally.

37:22.857 --> 37:26.360
Anyway, things got worse between us
after I graduated.

37:26.444 --> 37:28.738
I committed to being a full-time superhero

37:28.821 --> 37:32.909
and he fell into the evil mastermind
business, yada-yada-yada. That's my story.

37:32.992 --> 37:34.368
Wow.

37:34.452 --> 37:38.122
And this whole time,
I just had this weird feeling

37:38.206 --> 37:42.919
that there was just something
a little off about you.

37:43.002 --> 37:47.715
- Really?
- You just had a secret, that's all.

37:47.798 --> 37:51.801
- A supersecret.
- Now we both do.

37:51.885 --> 37:55.222
- May I ask you something?
- What?

37:57.224 --> 38:01.353
I just think it could
maybe be a fun thing to try.

38:01.436 --> 38:04.064
It's kind of a request.

38:09.945 --> 38:12.030
Sure.

38:14.950 --> 38:17.661
- Be right back.
- OK.

38:28.170 --> 38:30.589
Is this what you had in mind?

38:30.673 --> 38:34.009
Oh, yeah. That's it.

38:40.224 --> 38:45.104
Matt Saunders,
you've been a very, very evil boy.

38:47.815 --> 38:50.651
I think you need to be brought to justice.

38:50.734 --> 38:55.489
Yeah. I have been known
to bend a rule here and there.

38:55.573 --> 39:00.785
Total unrelenting justice.

39:03.580 --> 39:06.374
Hey! Wow! Shit!

39:08.168 --> 39:11.004
- Don't let go, all right?
- Oh, no.

39:11.087 --> 39:13.965
Oh, yeah, you got me.

39:14.048 --> 39:16.134
Scared you.

39:20.221 --> 39:21.764
Wow.

39:21.848 --> 39:24.392
Wow, we are high.

39:24.476 --> 39:27.520
- We are really, really high.
- Oh, yeah!

39:27.604 --> 39:33.026
Jenny, you know, as fun as this is, I'm
feeling just a little bit emasculated here,

39:33.109 --> 39:37.321
with you kind of carrying me around
like a toy poodle. But don't let go.

39:37.404 --> 39:41.617
Careful. Where are you going?
Careful. Come on. Fly right.

39:41.700 --> 39:43.785
Be careful.

39:44.745 --> 39:48.665
- I've always wanted to try this.
- Try what?

39:51.084 --> 39:55.631
That? Wow.
I'm not sure that's gonna work up here.

39:55.714 --> 39:57.799
It's draughty too.

39:58.550 --> 40:01.136
What if I do this?

40:04.431 --> 40:09.186
- You're not wearing any underwear.
- Yeah. I thought it might be easier that way.

40:14.190 --> 40:17.777
- Isn't this fun?
- It is fun. Yeah.

40:17.860 --> 40:21.322
Puts a whole new twist
on the mile-high club.

40:21.405 --> 40:23.449
Ready?

40:23.533 --> 40:25.827
Whoa. Not ready!

40:26.911 --> 40:29.288
- No!
- Just go with it.

40:29.372 --> 40:32.208
- Yeah, but...
- I know, I know! Don't stop! Yes.

40:32.291 --> 40:33.417
- No!
- Yes!

40:33.501 --> 40:35.586
- Oh, god, no!
- Yeah!

40:36.838 --> 40:38.923
Jenny!

40:40.299 --> 40:41.801
Yes!

40:42.635 --> 40:44.220
Yes!

40:45.513 --> 40:48.224
Don't ever do that again!

40:51.017 --> 40:54.563
G-Girl's hair before.

40:59.109 --> 41:01.653
Watch and learn.

41:16.459 --> 41:20.589
Her body is made
of the toughest substance known to man.

41:22.299 --> 41:24.384
But I know your secret.

41:43.777 --> 41:47.114
All right, now. G-Girl's hair after.

41:52.244 --> 41:54.455
Yes! Yes!

42:03.129 --> 42:06.257
- Saunders, what's wrong?
- I got a splinter in my finger.

42:06.341 --> 42:09.844
- Let me see.
- It's no big deal. I can get it out, I just need...

42:09.928 --> 42:12.680
- Come here. I'm good at this.
- What are you gonna do?

42:12.764 --> 42:14.849
Hold on.

42:22.357 --> 42:24.818
Hey, how did you do that?

42:24.901 --> 42:26.986
Well, I have my ways.

42:28.071 --> 42:30.448
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

42:33.409 --> 42:35.370
Jenny, what...

42:35.453 --> 42:37.705
What are you doing in New Jersey?

42:37.788 --> 42:40.666
I called your office
and found out where you were.

42:40.749 --> 42:43.460
I thought I would surprise you.

42:44.628 --> 42:49.091
- Are you surprised?
- I am surprised. I wanted to...

42:53.262 --> 42:56.598
Thanks. Good to see you.
Let me introduce you to Hannah Lewis.

42:56.682 --> 43:00.394
- This is Jenny Johnson.
- Hi. It's really nice to finally meet you.

43:00.477 --> 43:03.063
- Saunders talks about you all the time.
- I do.

43:03.147 --> 43:05.607
- I feel like I already know you.
- Really?

43:05.691 --> 43:08.652
Cos I feel like I'm just
getting to know you.

43:08.735 --> 43:12.072
OK. Hey, um... Got an idea.

43:12.156 --> 43:16.242
Hannah and her boyfriend Steve, I was
thinking, maybe we go out this weekend,

43:16.325 --> 43:20.746
just the two couples, two happy couples,
hit the town? What do you say?

43:20.830 --> 43:22.540
- Great.
- Great.

43:22.623 --> 43:23.749
Great.

43:29.547 --> 43:31.632
Oh, OK.

43:32.884 --> 43:34.969
Bye.

43:38.473 --> 43:42.810
I'm sorry, guys. I have some bad news.

43:42.894 --> 43:47.773
- You got a little something right there.
- Oh, thank you.

43:47.857 --> 43:51.276
Steve can't make it.
He had an emergency thong shoot.

43:51.359 --> 43:54.613
- A thong shoot emergency?
- Yeah, well, you know,

43:54.696 --> 43:56.740
one bad wedgie can be fatal.

43:56.823 --> 43:58.200
Yeah.

44:01.369 --> 44:04.164
Where's our stupid waiter? Sir!

44:05.123 --> 44:07.209
Hold on. Something's going on.

44:07.292 --> 44:10.003
The Pentagon has confirmed
an errant test missile

44:10.086 --> 44:13.298
is in fact on a direct course
for the tristate area.

44:13.381 --> 44:17.761
So far, all attempts to detonate or intercept
the missile have been unsuccessful.

44:17.844 --> 44:19.638
Great. Perfect.

44:19.721 --> 44:25.268
If it strikes within the city, the death
toll could reach into the thousands.

44:25.352 --> 44:28.145
- That does not sound good.
- Yeah, it sounds serious.

44:28.229 --> 44:31.482
Maybe somebody should do something.

44:31.565 --> 44:35.778
Mm-hm, yeah, like the air force.
It's their job, right?

44:35.861 --> 44:39.990
So, Hannah, how long
have you and Matty known each other?

44:40.074 --> 44:44.829
Well, we started working together
at Cockrum about three years ago.

44:44.912 --> 44:48.833
We're getting reports of sporadic
looting from the Bronx to Staten Island.

44:48.916 --> 44:53.045
The government has urged people
not to panic and to stay in their homes.

44:56.006 --> 45:01.345
Mmm, gnocchi. Gnocchi sounds good.
Anyone want to share a gnocchi?

45:01.428 --> 45:04.514
I'm sorry, but what if
the air force can't stop it?

45:04.597 --> 45:07.809
Somebody else might need to step in.

45:07.892 --> 45:10.937
Maybe somebody deserves one night out

45:11.020 --> 45:13.773
without having to deal
with some impending disaster.

45:13.857 --> 45:16.025
I think someone has earned it. Don't you?

45:21.614 --> 45:23.992
Are you on a diet?
What are you gonna order?

45:24.075 --> 45:28.580
I don't know. I mean, shouldn't
we be leaving? Is this safe here?

45:28.663 --> 45:32.250
Sir! Can we get some service here?
I mean, I'm filling up on baguette.

45:32.333 --> 45:35.545
I think everybody's preoccupied
with what's happening.

45:35.628 --> 45:38.631
Maybe if someone
could just take care of the problem,

45:38.715 --> 45:42.468
everyone can have a better night,
a smoother night, know what I mean?

45:42.551 --> 45:45.846
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Yeah, I'd appreciate it.

45:45.929 --> 45:49.099
In fact, I'd superappreciate it.

45:54.480 --> 45:56.565
All right. Fine!

46:06.492 --> 46:08.577
Is she OK? Where is she going?

46:08.660 --> 46:12.122
She's fine. She gets stressed.
I have her looping around the block.

46:12.206 --> 46:17.627
Too late for a mass evacuation, the situation
is dangerous and potentially catastrophic.

46:17.710 --> 46:24.091
But all the citizens of New York can do
is sit, wait and pray for a miracle.

46:24.175 --> 46:30.515
We're now getting a live picture of the
missile as it approaches the city.

46:31.766 --> 46:35.269
It appears certain that...
Wait, what is that?

46:37.146 --> 46:38.606
It is G-Girl!

46:40.566 --> 46:45.446
- She is approaching the errant missile.
- Love that girl!

46:46.697 --> 46:48.241
My God!

46:48.324 --> 46:50.827
She just kicked it.

46:50.910 --> 46:55.288
She just deflected the missile
away from the city.

46:57.290 --> 46:59.751
We're safe! We are safe!

47:11.638 --> 47:14.641
G-Girl! G-Girl! G-Girl!

47:28.487 --> 47:34.618
You know, Matt, there are some things
I don't need infravision to see through.

47:35.911 --> 47:38.747
Sorry, what are you talking about?

47:38.831 --> 47:42.376
You and that slut from your office
- Hannah.

47:42.460 --> 47:46.922
She is not a slut.
That is a terrible thing to say, Jenny.

47:48.924 --> 47:53.721
- You want to screw her, don't you?
- No. No, I do not.

47:53.804 --> 47:55.639
I don't believe you.

47:55.723 --> 47:57.808
Can I say something?

47:57.892 --> 48:00.978
Her boyfriend's a male model, OK? A model.

48:01.061 --> 48:03.980
I don't think she'd be very interested
in a guy like me.

48:04.063 --> 48:05.857
I see your point.

48:05.940 --> 48:10.570
So you want to screw her, you just can't,
because she's got a boyfriend.

48:10.653 --> 48:15.158
No, I'm just saying that we're friends
who work together. We're work friends.

48:15.241 --> 48:18.119
Don't lie to me!

48:21.790 --> 48:26.586
- What the hell did you do that for?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

48:26.669 --> 48:29.756
I'll pay for that, I swear.

48:32.801 --> 48:36.262
OK, don't... d-don't do that.

48:36.346 --> 48:39.307
Don't cry, OK? It'll be OK.

48:40.307 --> 48:43.936
I know I get a little crazy sometimes.

48:44.019 --> 48:46.104
It's just...

48:47.898 --> 48:50.400
I love you so much.

48:55.405 --> 48:57.699
OK... OK...

49:11.505 --> 49:14.925
- Hey.
- Hey. How's it going?

49:15.926 --> 49:17.927
Oh, sorry.

49:18.010 --> 49:22.014
Look at her. She's like a cheerleader
from Spank Me University.

49:24.100 --> 49:28.020
Dude, what's wrong?
You look like shit.

49:28.104 --> 49:32.108
Let's go with the lighter weight today,
shall we?

49:32.191 --> 49:36.946
I'm actually thinking that
my first impression of Jenny was accurate.

49:37.029 --> 49:41.742
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, complete emotional basket case.

49:42.785 --> 49:45.329
- Needy, jealous...
- Mm-hm. Jealous.

49:45.413 --> 49:48.624
Control...
- Controlling. A trifecta. Perfect.

49:48.708 --> 49:51.627
The truth is, I don't even love her.

49:54.087 --> 49:56.715
I'm in love with somebody else.

49:56.798 --> 49:59.050
You're in love with somebody else? Who?

49:59.134 --> 50:01.553
Is it me? Oh, my God, it's me, isn't it?

50:01.636 --> 50:04.431
I feel the same way. I totally...

50:06.475 --> 50:09.352
That's not a good sign, is it?

50:09.436 --> 50:13.190
- Who are you talking about?
- I don't wanna say. Not until I've told her.

50:13.273 --> 50:15.942
But, I mean, first I have
to break it off with Jenny.

50:16.026 --> 50:19.654
- God knows how I'm gonna do that.
- OK, come with me. Listen.

50:19.738 --> 50:23.867
There are only two ways to successfully
break it off with a woman.

50:23.950 --> 50:26.620
You can either be a jerk or a weenie.

50:26.703 --> 50:32.333
Now, the jerk route is simple. You're like,
"Hey, babe, listen up. I'm dumping your ass."

50:32.416 --> 50:35.377
Just like that. It's quick,
it's easy, it's painless.

50:35.461 --> 50:39.548
- I don't think you have the balls for it.
- Well, what's the weenie route?

50:39.632 --> 50:42.760
OK, good. Weenie route. Let's go with that.

50:42.843 --> 50:46.305
Sit real close, keep it romantic, OK?

50:46.388 --> 50:52.102
Keep a kind of a sparkle in the eye,
take her hand. Give me your hand.

50:52.186 --> 50:54.688
You say, "Sweetheart",

50:54.772 --> 51:00.361
I think we need to take a little time off
from the relationship to re-evaluate things."

51:00.444 --> 51:03.030
Don't return any of her calls
for a year and a half.

51:03.114 --> 51:06.324
Pretty soon she'll give up
and you'll be in the clear.

51:06.407 --> 51:08.660
I can't believe I actually listen to you.

51:08.743 --> 51:12.163
Another thing. Make sure you do it
after you've had sex with her.

51:12.247 --> 51:14.999
It's really difficult the other way around.

51:26.469 --> 51:31.141
I was thinking, maybe we should
take a little time to...

51:31.224 --> 51:33.935
re-examine where this is going.

51:38.439 --> 51:40.525
My God.

51:41.733 --> 51:44.361
Are you breaking up with me?

51:45.612 --> 51:48.532
No. No. Not at all.

51:50.284 --> 51:57.499
I mean, I just... I think it would be wise
to try and evaluate where we stand,

51:58.667 --> 52:01.503
just to make sure we're on the same page.

52:03.464 --> 52:09.136
So you're not saying that we should
start seeing other people or anything?

52:09.219 --> 52:11.722
No. No.

52:11.805 --> 52:14.391
No, I'm not saying that.

52:14.475 --> 52:18.144
OK, good. You scared me there for a second.

52:18.227 --> 52:25.401
Although seeing other people might eventually
be a part of the evaluation process.

52:31.616 --> 52:33.701
Oh, my God.

52:35.077 --> 52:36.913
You are breaking up with me.

52:36.996 --> 52:41.000
- Jenny, it's not you, OK?
- Shut up!

52:46.339 --> 52:50.343
I know exactly what it is.
It's that slut from your office, Hannah.

52:50.426 --> 52:52.929
- You're sleeping with her.
- I am not sleep...

52:53.012 --> 52:56.807
- But you want to!
- Jenny, now, hold on a second, OK?

52:56.890 --> 52:59.559
You're such a liar!

52:59.643 --> 53:05.190
Look, I am not a liar, all right? You wanna
know the truth? It's not Hannah, OK? It's you.

53:05.273 --> 53:08.985
You're needy, jealous, manipulative.
I can't take it anymore.

53:09.069 --> 53:12.197
- It's crazy.
- Don't call me crazy!

53:16.118 --> 53:21.206
See? That's the kind of thing I'm talking
about. I can't handle that on a daily basis.

53:21.289 --> 53:23.458
Well, handle this.

53:25.877 --> 53:28.880
What are you doing?!

53:35.803 --> 53:38.848
You are so gonna regret this.

53:44.395 --> 53:46.480
Oh, man.

53:54.071 --> 53:55.948
- Wednesday? Thursday?
- No. No.

53:56.031 --> 53:59.285
Friday? Saturday? Sunday?
Brunch? In the day?

53:59.368 --> 54:01.454
Don't speak to me.

54:05.249 --> 54:07.959
Oh, well. Look at it this way.

54:08.042 --> 54:10.378
The hard part is over.

54:10.462 --> 54:12.755
I don't know. She said I'd regret it.

54:13.381 --> 54:15.842
Don't worry about that.
They always say that.

54:15.925 --> 54:17.760
Yeah?

54:17.844 --> 54:19.929
I guess you're right.

54:20.847 --> 54:26.811
You know, there's something that I've been
dying to tell you ever since I found it out.

54:26.895 --> 54:29.689
- Found out what?
- I just need you to promise me...

54:29.773 --> 54:32.817
- I promise.
- Hold on, let me finish, this is serious.

54:32.901 --> 54:39.157
- I need you to promise me that you're not...
- I promise. I won't tell anybody. Tell me.

54:40.241 --> 54:42.826
You know Jenny?

54:44.995 --> 54:47.080
Yeah.

54:49.917 --> 54:52.002
She's G-Girl.

54:59.343 --> 55:01.428
Bullshit.

55:02.179 --> 55:03.388
Bullshit.

55:03.472 --> 55:06.642
Apparently, this old dog
still has a few tricks left.

55:06.725 --> 55:09.853
Oh, my God, you have been doing G-Girl!

55:09.937 --> 55:12.689
- I know! It's unbelievable. Me.
- Incredible.

55:12.773 --> 55:14.566
- I can't believe it.
- Knuckles.

55:14.650 --> 55:17.694
Imagine the heat I'll have
with the women when they find out.

55:17.778 --> 55:21.823
Wait. Whoa. Isn't she gonna mind
you revealing her secret identity?

55:21.906 --> 55:24.867
I warned you, Matt Saunders!

55:25.660 --> 55:27.411
No!

55:36.587 --> 55:39.632
♪ She hates me

55:39.715 --> 55:42.885
♪ Trust, she fucking hates me

55:42.969 --> 55:45.179
♪ La la la la

55:45.263 --> 55:48.432
♪ She hates me

55:48.516 --> 55:50.309
♪ Trust, she fucking hates me

55:50.393 --> 55:52.895
Watch it, dumb-ass!

56:07.909 --> 56:09.661
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

56:09.744 --> 56:12.914
What could be wrong?
Everything's great. Never better.

56:12.998 --> 56:15.041
Tell me.

56:15.959 --> 56:20.255
OK. I, uh... I broke up with Jenny.

56:20.338 --> 56:25.093
You were right. I mean, she is
totally deranged, off-her-rocker crazy.

56:25.177 --> 56:28.472
I should have listened to you
from the beginning.

56:28.555 --> 56:31.682
Why don't you lay off
the crazy women for a while, huh?

56:31.765 --> 56:34.477
Come here. I'm sorry.

56:34.560 --> 56:36.645
Hey, Hannah.

56:37.521 --> 56:41.358
There's been something that I've been
meaning to tell you for a long time.

56:41.442 --> 56:43.527
Yes?

56:43.611 --> 56:45.571
It's about you and...

56:50.326 --> 56:52.411
- Sorry. Are you OK?
- Out. Now.

56:52.495 --> 56:54.705
I'm going through a weird phase.

56:54.789 --> 56:57.249
- I saw that!
- What? No, it was nothing, Carla.

56:57.333 --> 56:59.960
Nothing? You knocked her down! You hit her!

57:00.044 --> 57:04.298
- Was there groping? Did he grope you?
- No, it was an accident.

57:04.381 --> 57:06.467
An accident? OK, like a fender-bender?

57:06.550 --> 57:09.344
Here, we need to talk. Come here.

57:10.553 --> 57:15.183
Listen, my friend.
You are headed for some serious trouble.

57:15.266 --> 57:18.353
- Don't make excuses. That's the first mistake.
- OK.

57:18.436 --> 57:22.857
You have got to get your mind out of the
gutter long enough to nail this presentation.

57:22.941 --> 57:27.570
- I hear you, homegirl. I got it.
- What? What did you just call me?!

57:27.654 --> 57:28.905
What? I don't know.

57:28.988 --> 57:33.785
If the company doesn't get this project,
we're going to take a major hit.

57:33.868 --> 57:36.913
You really have a problem.
Call my therapist.

57:36.996 --> 57:38.873
OK, I'll call him... her.

57:38.957 --> 57:40.750
- Matt.
- What?

57:40.834 --> 57:43.335
- Phone call.
- Oh, man.

57:45.546 --> 57:48.715
That boy has a major case of the hornies.

57:51.260 --> 57:52.803
Yeah?

57:52.886 --> 57:56.390
There's the young kid that zooms around
in here. Did he do something?

57:56.473 --> 58:00.310
- It's just up here.
- Looks like they broke in, fried the camera

58:00.394 --> 58:02.688
and then blew a huge hole
through the wall.

58:02.771 --> 58:06.150
- I've never seen nothing like it.
- Don't make no sense.

58:06.233 --> 58:09.153
We got a lot of nice cars -
his is the only one they took.

58:09.236 --> 58:10.946
Bitch.

58:11.029 --> 58:16.994
Somebody went to a lot of trouble.
You know who could have done this?

58:17.077 --> 58:19.495
No. No, I don't.

58:19.579 --> 58:23.749
- Somebody with a grudge against you?
- Grudge? Against me?

58:25.209 --> 58:27.753
No. No, I don't. I'm sorry.

58:27.837 --> 58:30.131
- We'll let you know if it turns up.
- OK.

58:30.214 --> 58:34.135
- Let's get to the paperwork.
- I wouldn't hold my breath on that, sir.

58:36.179 --> 58:39.766
Gentlemen...

58:39.849 --> 58:43.269
If you look closely, our model here...

58:43.352 --> 58:45.438
What the hell...?

58:48.065 --> 58:50.234
Oh, that's just great.

58:53.613 --> 58:56.531
Oh, shit! I just got that fixed.

58:56.615 --> 59:02.329
Sorry, just came to use your telescope.
Nice and dark, isn't it?

59:02.412 --> 59:05.248
Wait a second. Is this all because of you?

59:05.332 --> 59:10.253
Yep, that'd be me. Ah, yes.

59:10.337 --> 59:12.672
There we go.

59:12.756 --> 59:15.300
Come and have a look-see.

59:21.348 --> 59:22.432
I don't see any...

59:29.189 --> 59:32.942
- That's real mature.
- Save you a fortune in parking.

59:33.025 --> 59:37.279
Why are you doing this to me?
I mean, you're supposed to be the good guy.

59:37.363 --> 59:41.367
I am the good guy. You are the bad guy.

59:41.450 --> 59:45.329
It's been a pleasure seeing you,
but I got a big day at the office tomorrow.

59:45.412 --> 59:49.416
I've got an important presentation to make,
so I need to get some sleep.

59:49.500 --> 59:54.713
I'm gonna have to say good night. You might
be the hottest girl I've ever gone out with,

59:54.797 --> 59:58.801
but you wanna know something?
You're the craziest, hands down!

59:58.884 --> 01:00:01.178
- Really?
- Aargh!

01:00:21.322 --> 01:00:23.658
Dick?!

01:00:27.704 --> 01:00:29.414
Will we begin soon?

01:00:29.497 --> 01:00:33.168
I'm so sorry you've been kept waiting.
I apologize. It's very rude.

01:00:33.251 --> 01:00:36.588
Just a few more minutes, please.

01:00:36.671 --> 01:00:40.133
- Hi. Excuse me, hi.
- Glad you could join us.

01:00:40.216 --> 01:00:42.927
Can you tell me why you're wearing a hat?

01:00:43.011 --> 01:00:46.513
- No.
- Why am I not surprised?

01:00:46.847 --> 01:00:49.266
- Hi. How are you?
- We can finally begin.

01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:51.935
- Gentlemen, I give you Matt Saunders.
- You OK?

01:00:52.019 --> 01:00:54.563
I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:00:54.646 --> 01:00:57.357
OK, gentlemen...

01:01:00.611 --> 01:01:04.948
OK. Our design integrates
classic architectural ideas

01:01:05.032 --> 01:01:07.075
from the history of Chinese culture

01:01:07.159 --> 01:01:11.914
and transforms them
into a contemporary 21st century esthetic.

01:01:11.997 --> 01:01:16.168
But you can see clearly
that functionality has not been sac...

01:01:19.755 --> 01:01:22.006
Sac...

01:01:23.424 --> 01:01:29.055
Sacrificed, as you can see here
by the multiple entrances to the central

01:01:29.138 --> 01:01:31.766
multipurpose courtyard area.

01:01:31.849 --> 01:01:34.268
Exactly. Exactly. Right.

01:01:34.352 --> 01:01:37.105
And with a total capacity for...

01:01:55.706 --> 01:01:59.167
You are one sick bastard!

01:02:03.839 --> 01:02:07.759
Oh, man. I am so, so sorry.

01:02:07.843 --> 01:02:09.928
Thanks.

01:02:10.887 --> 01:02:14.057
- You gotta laugh to keep from crying, right?
- Vaughn, shh!

01:02:14.141 --> 01:02:15.600
Sorry.

01:02:15.684 --> 01:02:19.438
Man, no woman's ever done that to me,
and I actually am a dick.

01:02:19.521 --> 01:02:24.818
OK, all done.
I am so sorry that you got fired.

01:02:24.901 --> 01:02:27.320
What happened in there?
Why did you...

01:02:27.404 --> 01:02:31.491
It's hard to explain. Let's just say
it's a good time for me to leave.

01:02:31.575 --> 01:02:35.828
- Where are you going?
- Don't know. Don't care.

01:02:35.911 --> 01:02:41.041
Look, if there's something wrong,
I'd like to help.

01:02:41.125 --> 01:02:48.048
Look, Hannah. Please just stay
as far away from me as possible, OK?

01:02:48.132 --> 01:02:51.427
If something were to happen to you
because of me,

01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:54.430
I wouldn't be able to live with myself.

01:03:13.448 --> 01:03:15.575
Oh, damn!

01:03:19.162 --> 01:03:21.414
May we come in?

01:03:21.498 --> 01:03:23.583
Nice place.

01:03:28.713 --> 01:03:31.341
You broke her heart, didn't you?

01:03:31.424 --> 01:03:34.803
What do you need? Why are you here?
I'm in the middle of a project.

01:03:34.886 --> 01:03:38.598
The same as you -
to get her out of my life for good.

01:03:38.681 --> 01:03:41.059
I want you to help me neutralize her.

01:03:41.142 --> 01:03:46.480
Hey, whatever she's done to me,
I'm not gonna help you kill her.

01:03:46.563 --> 01:03:49.233
I didn't say "kill", I said "neutralize".

01:03:49.316 --> 01:03:52.653
It's a neutral word.
"Kill" is "kill". This is Switzerland.

01:03:52.736 --> 01:03:58.659
I have developed the means
of permanently stripping her of her powers.

01:03:59.827 --> 01:04:01.411
No powers?

01:04:01.495 --> 01:04:06.917
So she'd just be another average, everyday,
run-of-the-mill, crazy ex-girlfriend?

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.420
Yeah. That's gotta be better.

01:04:10.129 --> 01:04:14.800
- So what would you want me to do?
- Draw her out into the open.

01:04:14.883 --> 01:04:18.137
Help me get her when her guard is down,
when she's vulnerable.

01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:22.974
Look, I don't mean to offend you,
but you have a reputation for doing things

01:04:23.057 --> 01:04:25.518
that most people would consider to be...

01:04:25.601 --> 01:04:27.353
No-nos?

01:04:27.437 --> 01:04:28.646
Yes.

01:04:28.729 --> 01:04:32.984
Yeah. Nothing to worry about. I'm retiring.

01:04:33.067 --> 01:04:35.319
- From supervillainy?
- Yeah.

01:04:35.403 --> 01:04:39.740
That's good. Look, if you're going to
retire, why not just forget about her?

01:04:39.824 --> 01:04:42.410
That's what I'm gonna do.
I'm leaving town.

01:04:42.493 --> 01:04:49.125
Because that woman, she just won't
leave me alone. She's obsessed with me.

01:04:49.208 --> 01:04:53.212
She has harassed me at every turn
and she never, ever stops.

01:04:53.296 --> 01:04:59.718
So when you finally realize that she is not the
woman who is ever going to forget about you,

01:05:00.635 --> 01:05:03.555
- then you give me a call.
- OK.

01:05:03.638 --> 01:05:05.724
All right?

01:05:09.269 --> 01:05:12.606
Or you can email me
at "professorbedlam.com".

01:05:12.689 --> 01:05:14.775
It's all one word.

01:05:17.778 --> 01:05:22.365
I think I'll just, uh...
give running away a try.

01:05:28.914 --> 01:05:32.292
It's Matt.
Please leave a message.

01:05:32.375 --> 01:05:36.796
Matt, it's Hannah.
Are you there? Please pick up.

01:05:36.879 --> 01:05:41.550
I... I need your help.
Something really bad's happened.

01:05:42.426 --> 01:05:46.472
- Oh, God, I guess you're not there. Bye.

Hannah. Are you OK?
What did she do to you? Is she here?

- Is who here?

01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:24.926
G-Girl? Like the superhero?

01:06:25.009 --> 01:06:27.303
Yeah, G-Girl the super...

01:06:28.513 --> 01:06:30.598
Why did you call me?

01:06:32.434 --> 01:06:35.520
- Steve was cheating on me.
- Oh, thank God.

01:06:35.603 --> 01:06:37.939
What?

01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:43.236

sooner rather than later.

01:06:43.319 --> 01:06:45.071
I am sorry.

01:06:45.155 --> 01:06:49.032
Yeah, I caught him in bed
with another woman.

01:06:49.116 --> 01:06:51.785
Actually, two other women.

01:06:51.869 --> 01:06:56.373
Maybe three. I don't know - I
didn't really get a good look.

01:06:56.457 --> 01:06:58.751
- Three?
- Yeah.

01:06:59.752 --> 01:07:00.544
Wow.

01:07:00.627 --> 01:07:06.091
Steve was so good-looking
and he loved jazz and rock-climbing.

01:07:06.175 --> 01:07:08.635
He took me to nice places
and gave me multiple...

01:07:08.719 --> 01:07:11.513
I don't really need to hear that.

01:07:16.977 --> 01:07:21.565
The thing is,
I never really had any fun with him.

01:07:23.024 --> 01:07:25.943
Not like I have with you.

01:07:26.027 --> 01:07:30.281
You've been
a really good friend to me, Saunders.

01:07:32.909 --> 01:07:34.994
Hannah, the thing is,

01:07:36.454 --> 01:07:39.624
I don't wanna be just a friend any more.

01:07:39.707 --> 01:07:42.001
- You don't?
- No.

01:07:43.252 --> 01:07:45.296
Look...

01:07:46.214 --> 01:07:50.760
Hannah, my life has been
really crazy lately.

01:07:50.843 --> 01:07:53.930
But it has made me realize
what's most important to me.

01:07:54.013 --> 01:07:59.768
Seeing you at work every day, that was always
the thing I looked forward to the most.

01:07:59.851 --> 01:08:05.148
You're the smartest,
most beautiful girl that I've ever met.

01:08:07.109 --> 01:08:10.529
And I'm completely
and totally in love with you.

01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:13.406
Oh.

01:08:32.759 --> 01:08:38.096
Oh, that was great. Didn't hurt at all.

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:45.104
I probably shouldn't tell you this, but
this might be the best moment of my life.

01:08:45.187 --> 01:08:48.064
That's not fair. I was gonna say that.

01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:49.649
Oh.

01:08:49.733 --> 01:08:51.819
Hey! Sweetie!

01:08:56.282 --> 01:08:57.658
Matt?

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:01.912
I hate you, Matt Saunders!

01:09:04.165 --> 01:09:06.041
Get down!

01:09:43.368 --> 01:09:46.622
Why did G-Girl throw a shark at us?

01:09:49.917 --> 01:09:52.377
I can't tell you.

01:09:52.461 --> 01:09:55.631
And she was so pissed off.
Have you done something?

01:09:55.714 --> 01:09:58.258
- Are you in trouble?
- No. Well, yeah.

01:09:58.342 --> 01:10:00.636
And as long as I'm here, so are you.

01:10:00.719 --> 01:10:03.514
You gotta get outside the city.
Go someplace and hide.

01:10:03.597 --> 01:10:06.558
San Diego. Tahiti. Utah.

01:10:06.642 --> 01:10:09.186
No, not Utah, Utah sucks. Anywhere else.

01:10:09.269 --> 01:10:11.980
But you gotta go someplace,
lay low for a while.

01:10:12.064 --> 01:10:14.691
- I don't understand.
- Look.

01:10:14.775 --> 01:10:19.321
If I ever see you again,
this will all be over, OK?

01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:22.533
If?

01:10:22.616 --> 01:10:24.700
Matt, wait.

01:10:57.567 --> 01:11:00.360
- Oh, it's you.
- Come in. Wait here.

01:11:01.736 --> 01:11:04.406
- Right here? Where?
- What? Right here.

01:11:04.489 --> 01:11:07.409
- OK.
- Over there.

01:11:22.132 --> 01:11:24.217
Wow.

01:11:33.393 --> 01:11:39.106
Look, I'm here cos I need your help, OK? I
just need to know how we're gonna stop her.

01:11:39.190 --> 01:11:45.071
I have spent the past ten years trying
to analyze the source of G-Girl's power.

01:11:45.154 --> 01:11:48.574
It is a unique type of radiation
that permeates every cell of her body.

01:11:48.657 --> 01:11:53.662
Yeah, I know about the meteor in
high school. She told me. I know.

01:11:53.746 --> 01:11:55.831
- She told you that?
- Yeah.

01:11:56.874 --> 01:11:59.376
Did she talk about me?

01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:03.047
I mean, she said you guys were friends,
you had a falling out.

01:12:03.130 --> 01:12:07.551
Bullshit! That meteorite
changed everything between us.

01:12:07.635 --> 01:12:12.931
But now, I've got something
that will totally level the playing field.

01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:19.437
That?

01:12:19.521 --> 01:12:21.231
The rock?

01:12:21.314 --> 01:12:24.275
No, the ham. Yes, the rock.

01:12:26.027 --> 01:12:30.740
A special rock.
It was a rock that gave off the radiation.

01:12:30.824 --> 01:12:34.327
I now have a rock
that will absorb the radiation.

01:12:35.662 --> 01:12:38.289
So if you got Jenny
close enough to this thing...

01:12:38.373 --> 01:12:42.585
It'll draw the radiation from her body,
sucking it out of her like a sponge.

01:12:42.669 --> 01:12:46.256
Draining her of her powers permanently.

01:12:46.339 --> 01:12:50.592
OK, so what do you need me for?
Why can't you just get her close to it?

01:12:50.676 --> 01:12:53.429
With that superhearing of hers?

01:12:53.512 --> 01:12:57.057
No, I need someone who can lure her to it.

01:12:57.141 --> 01:12:59.852
Someone who she has no cause to fear.

01:12:59.935 --> 01:13:02.938
A weak and powerless simpleton.

01:13:03.021 --> 01:13:05.107
An idiot.

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:25.793
No, all of these invoices were
returned. None of them have been paid.

01:13:25.877 --> 01:13:28.337
Call back.

01:13:29.964 --> 01:13:33.509
And these two are supposed to be...

01:13:38.514 --> 01:13:40.600
Hi.

01:13:44.353 --> 01:13:45.354
Hi.

01:13:45.438 --> 01:13:46.773
What's this?

01:13:46.856 --> 01:13:49.734
It's just a little something
I thought I'd bring by...

01:13:49.817 --> 01:13:51.569
- Flowers?
- Yeah.

01:13:51.652 --> 01:13:55.615
You think flowers
are going to make me forgive you?

01:13:55.698 --> 01:13:59.619
No. No, I do not think that.
I don't think that at all.

01:13:59.702 --> 01:14:03.038
Then what the hell are you doing here?

01:14:03.121 --> 01:14:10.003
OK, look. To be honest, I realize that
I've made the biggest mistake of my life.

01:14:10.087 --> 01:14:16.551
I'm desperately in love with you and I'd
do anything for us to be together again.

01:14:22.182 --> 01:14:24.267
I would.

01:14:33.068 --> 01:14:35.070
Oh, God.

01:14:35.153 --> 01:14:37.238
They're beautiful.

01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:39.949
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

01:14:40.032 --> 01:14:43.119
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:14:43.202 --> 01:14:49.041
What do you think about today after work
you come by my place around seven

01:14:49.125 --> 01:14:55.256
- and I'll make us a nice dinner?
- Seven? I'd love to.

01:15:22.782 --> 01:15:24.868
Matt?

01:15:25.869 --> 01:15:27.954
Matt?

01:15:31.374 --> 01:15:33.877
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, Jenny.

01:15:35.170 --> 01:15:37.380
Matt, it's beautiful.

01:15:37.464 --> 01:15:40.550
Oh, what is that? Is that for me?

01:15:40.633 --> 01:15:44.262
It is. It's a little
something I got you cos...

01:15:44.345 --> 01:15:47.849
I wanna apologize
for the terrible way that I've treated you.

01:15:47.932 --> 01:15:51.435
- It just wasn't right.
- You're so sweet. You didn't have to.

01:15:51.518 --> 01:15:53.896
- It's true, I'm sorry.
- What is it?

01:15:53.979 --> 01:15:58.567
No peeking, OK? I want it
to be a surprise. Let's have a toast.

01:15:58.650 --> 01:16:01.320
You are amazing.

01:16:01.403 --> 01:16:04.406
To second chances.

01:16:05.449 --> 01:16:07.826
To second chances.

01:16:09.453 --> 01:16:14.041
The man's not bad.
He might have a future in our business.

01:16:14.583 --> 01:16:16.877
You know, deep down,

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:21.673
I had a feeling that you'd realize
your mistake and come back to me.

01:16:21.757 --> 01:16:23.842
You are wise.

01:16:25.761 --> 01:16:28.763
- Do you wanna know a secret?
- Sure.

01:16:32.475 --> 01:16:35.103
That's why I didn't kill you.

01:16:59.752 --> 01:17:01.045
Matt?

01:17:01.129 --> 01:17:03.880
You are the sweetest guy I've ever met.

01:17:03.964 --> 01:17:07.008
- Oh, no, no, I'm not.
- Yes, yes, you are.

01:17:07.968 --> 01:17:10.595
You're sweet.

01:17:10.679 --> 01:17:12.764
Yummy.

01:17:14.057 --> 01:17:16.351
Matt?!

01:17:16.435 --> 01:17:18.311
What are you doing here?

01:17:18.395 --> 01:17:20.981
Me?! What are you doing here?

01:17:21.064 --> 01:17:24.443
You said your life was in danger.
And what's she doing here?

01:17:24.526 --> 01:17:27.571
- Who's that? Do we know her?
- I don't know her.

01:17:27.654 --> 01:17:28.864
I don't know her.

01:17:28.947 --> 01:17:34.202
You know how you tried to steal my
boyfriend by being such a big, fat whore?

01:17:34.286 --> 01:17:36.913
- It didn't work.
- Jenny, stop. Let me handle this.

01:17:36.997 --> 01:17:38.456
- Are you back with her?
- No.

01:17:38.539 --> 01:17:40.624
- What?
- Yeah.

01:17:40.708 --> 01:17:43.794
Look, it's very complicated, OK?

01:17:43.878 --> 01:17:46.714
How could you do this?
You told me you loved me.

01:17:46.797 --> 01:17:49.759
Hannah, please, just do me a favor, OK?
Just leave.

01:17:49.842 --> 01:17:54.054
I mean, just try to have a little self-respect.
You're starting to look pathetic.

01:17:54.138 --> 01:17:59.894
Matt! You are not... Oh, my God. There you
are. Thank God. I've been calling you all day.

01:17:59.977 --> 01:18:02.688
Playoff tickets. Amazing seats. You and me.

01:18:02.772 --> 01:18:05.483
- Not now.
- Tonight. Third base line. Yahoo!

01:18:05.566 --> 01:18:09.028
- Now is a terrible time, OK?
- Hey, what's in the box?

01:18:09.111 --> 01:18:13.783
- Stay away from that box.
- You know, Hannah,

01:18:13.866 --> 01:18:17.911
why don't you just run along before I have
to kick your ass back to Munchkin Land?

01:18:17.994 --> 01:18:21.039
- Stay away from it.
- It looks big, it might be a nice present.

01:18:21.122 --> 01:18:25.085
- Are you threatening me?
- Push me one more time and you'll find out.

01:18:25.168 --> 01:18:29.464
Oh, yeah? What are you going to do?
Squash me with your gigantic feet?

01:18:29.547 --> 01:18:32.383
- That's it!
- Don't touch me!

01:18:33.968 --> 01:18:38.264
Just do me a favor and leave
and take Hannah with you...

01:18:38.973 --> 01:18:42.435
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God! You're G-Girl.

01:18:43.019 --> 01:18:45.397
You have been doing G-Girl?

01:18:46.314 --> 01:18:50.402
- Vaughn, open the box!
- Go! Go! Go! Watch the van!

01:18:52.152 --> 01:18:54.321
Open the damn box!

01:18:56.615 --> 01:18:57.991
Aargh!

01:18:58.075 --> 01:19:01.537
- It's not much of a present.
- Agh!

01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:03.705
I'm sorry.

01:19:06.417 --> 01:19:08.502
You bastard!

01:19:17.511 --> 01:19:20.347
Matt, that's a weird rock.

01:19:20.431 --> 01:19:21.807
Ah.

01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:26.019
A happy ending for everybody.
Well done, Mr. Saunders.

01:19:26.103 --> 01:19:28.980
You did this? You helped him?

01:19:29.063 --> 01:19:33.568
I'm really sorry.
You did throw a shark at me, you know.

01:19:33.651 --> 01:19:37.488
Besides, Bedlam's gonna retire.
It'll be OK.

01:19:38.489 --> 01:19:40.158
You idiot!

01:19:42.201 --> 01:19:45.538
Looks like you're done, honey.

01:19:45.621 --> 01:19:50.418
You always thought
you were so much better than me.

01:19:50.501 --> 01:19:52.378
Now it's my turn.

01:19:52.462 --> 01:19:55.757
Now I'll be the one with the powers.

01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:59.051
You'll be just plain old Jenny Johnson.

01:20:00.011 --> 01:20:02.805
We're having a moment here.

01:20:04.473 --> 01:20:09.853
- Not so tough now, huh?!
- Hannah, don't let her touch the rock!

01:20:23.325 --> 01:20:25.660
Hannah!

01:20:28.497 --> 01:20:29.956
Oh, no! Hannah!

01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:34.336
I can't even see her. We
gotta get down there.

01:20:34.419 --> 01:20:36.505
Oh, man!

01:20:37.464 --> 01:20:39.507
I think she's dead, Matt.

01:20:39.590 --> 01:20:42.385
- I'm sorry. Let her go.
- We gotta dig her out!

01:20:42.468 --> 01:20:45.846
- We gotta start the grieving process.
- Are you crazy?

01:20:45.930 --> 01:20:48.516
- Come here. Give me a hug, bear cub.
- You!

01:20:50.518 --> 01:20:53.229
I thought you were just a jerk!

01:20:53.312 --> 01:20:55.689
Now I find out you're really stupid.

01:20:55.773 --> 01:20:58.025
Teaming up with Barry?!

01:21:04.657 --> 01:21:09.537
You broke my heart
and now I'm gonna break your everything.

01:21:13.332 --> 01:21:15.334
Hey!

01:21:15.418 --> 01:21:18.253
Let go of my boyfriend, you crazy bitch!

01:21:19.212 --> 01:21:21.840
Bring it!

01:21:27.011 --> 01:21:29.222
Oh, man!

01:21:29.305 --> 01:21:31.766
Yes, girl fight!

01:21:32.517 --> 01:21:34.394
Stupid!

01:21:35.478 --> 01:21:37.522
Matt!

01:21:44.946 --> 01:21:47.031
No!

01:21:47.657 --> 01:21:49.492
Hannah!

01:21:49.576 --> 01:21:51.202
Hannah, are you OK?

01:21:52.161 --> 01:21:53.787
Oh, no!

01:22:00.919 --> 01:22:03.088
You rat!

01:22:06.341 --> 01:22:10.929
Oh, Matt. Matt, Matt, are you OK?

01:22:14.391 --> 01:22:16.393
Uh-oh.

01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:37.955
Wow!

01:22:41.250 --> 01:22:43.628
Hannah, stop. Come on, stop.

01:22:43.711 --> 01:22:45.213
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

01:22:45.296 --> 01:22:48.508
I'm fine too. I thought I twinged my knee,
but I'm all right.

01:22:48.591 --> 01:22:52.345
Come on. Forget about them. Let's go.

01:22:52.428 --> 01:22:54.680
Come on.

01:22:56.891 --> 01:23:00.436
They're gonna kill each other. This way.

01:23:02.522 --> 01:23:05.732
- Hey, it's you.
- Are you with them?

01:23:05.816 --> 01:23:07.901
As a matter of fact, I am.

01:23:08.985 --> 01:23:11.363
They went down there.

01:23:29.673 --> 01:23:32.259
Stop!

01:23:32.759 --> 01:23:36.805
Look at yourself.
You're terrifying these people.

01:23:40.142 --> 01:23:44.729
Jenny... Jenny,
this has gotta stop right now, OK?

01:23:44.812 --> 01:23:46.313
Please.

01:23:46.397 --> 01:23:48.858
Just give me that, OK?

01:23:48.941 --> 01:23:51.485
There you go. Just give it to me.

01:23:51.569 --> 01:23:55.364
Wow. That was a lot heavier than I thought.

01:23:56.490 --> 01:23:58.617
Hi.

01:23:58.701 --> 01:24:03.539
Look, God knows
I don't want you mad at me, OK?

01:24:03.622 --> 01:24:06.167
And I'm sorry if I ever hurt you.

01:24:06.250 --> 01:24:10.337
And yeah, I know what we had
was something special.

01:24:10.421 --> 01:24:12.757
And at times it was great.

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:17.927
But it wasn't love, all right?
And deep down, you know that.

01:24:19.137 --> 01:24:24.559
You're a great girl.
And you deserve to be with the perfect guy.

01:24:24.642 --> 01:24:26.394
- You do.
- I do.

01:24:26.478 --> 01:24:31.900
And I know who the perfect guy for you is.
And he's here, right here, right now.

01:24:31.983 --> 01:24:34.069
Professor.

01:24:36.654 --> 01:24:38.990
- What?
- Barry?

01:24:39.866 --> 01:24:42.494
- Go on, Professor, tell her.
- Tell her what?

01:24:42.577 --> 01:24:45.455
She's my mortal enemy?
I want nothing but her destruction?

01:24:45.538 --> 01:24:50.710
- Come on, Barry, please.
- Please stop calling me Barry.

01:24:50.794 --> 01:24:54.588
It's true. This guy,
he's got a shrine to you in his house.

01:24:54.671 --> 01:24:58.425
There are pictures of you
all over the walls, just of you.

01:24:58.509 --> 01:25:02.012
This guy, he is hooked on you.
He really is.

01:25:02.971 --> 01:25:05.599
Is that true?

01:25:11.605 --> 01:25:16.985
Come on. You gotta open your heart to her.
It's now or never.

01:25:17.069 --> 01:25:19.947
It may be a little true.

01:25:22.032 --> 01:25:26.995
OK, OK, that's a good start.
Come on, Barry. Barry, come on.

01:25:27.079 --> 01:25:29.705
All right, all right!

01:25:29.789 --> 01:25:31.874
It's completely true.

01:25:33.418 --> 01:25:36.045
I love you.

01:25:36.129 --> 01:25:39.048
I've always loved you.

01:25:39.132 --> 01:25:43.720
But if you love me so much, then how come
you're always trying to hurt me?

01:25:43.803 --> 01:25:49.142
Because you hurt me. Because you
broke my heart into a billion pieces.

01:25:49.225 --> 01:25:52.103
You ignored me.

01:25:52.186 --> 01:25:54.272
You left me behind.

01:25:56.274 --> 01:26:02.113
So I thought if I had the powers,
you may learn to love me

01:26:02.196 --> 01:26:05.574
the way I have always loved you.

01:26:09.870 --> 01:26:11.955
Are you sure?

01:26:13.331 --> 01:26:15.542
Do you really love me?

01:26:19.671 --> 01:26:21.923
Oh, yeah.

01:26:33.894 --> 01:26:36.938
It's over. Can you believe it?
I'm free. You were great.

01:26:37.022 --> 01:26:38.565
I can't believe that fight.

01:26:38.648 --> 01:26:41.734
I still think she'd kick my butt,
but I got a few good punches in.

01:26:41.817 --> 01:26:44.904
You saved my ass in there.
You were wonderful.

01:26:44.987 --> 01:26:48.157
And I'm really sorry
I didn't explain things to you sooner,

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:52.828
- but I was just trying to protect you.
- I totally understand.

01:26:52.912 --> 01:26:54.038
Good.

01:26:54.121 --> 01:26:58.167
- Oh, my God, my hair.
- Oh, it doesn't look that bad. You can fix it.

01:26:58.250 --> 01:27:00.211
Here, try this on.

01:27:00.294 --> 01:27:02.171
Thanks.

01:27:03.547 --> 01:27:06.092
See? Adorable.

01:27:06.175 --> 01:27:08.469
- Yes, you are.
- No, not me.

01:27:08.552 --> 01:27:11.347
- Come here.
- Agh!

01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:13.182
- Tight.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:27:13.265 --> 01:27:16.977
- It's OK.
- I'm still getting used to all of this.

01:27:17.061 --> 01:27:23.066
You and me both. And you know, we're going
to have to talk about the relationship too.

01:27:23.149 --> 01:27:27.028
- Talk? You mean...
- Your powers.

01:27:27.112 --> 01:27:31.991
Just cos you have 'em doesn't mean
you have to use 'em, you know what I mean?

01:27:32.075 --> 01:27:35.203
You're a little scared of me.

01:27:35.286 --> 01:27:38.206
What? Scared?
No, come on, I'm not scared at all.

01:27:38.289 --> 01:27:40.375
Come here.

01:27:49.467 --> 01:27:51.344
Are you ready?

01:27:51.428 --> 01:27:55.723
Yeah! I am. I'm ready.

01:27:55.806 --> 01:27:58.434
OK. Here we go.

01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:05.274
OK, all right, I got it.

01:28:12.197 --> 01:28:16.827
- Hold on, I think I tweaked something.
- Oh, you poor baby.

01:28:27.046 --> 01:28:29.173
What the hell were you doing?!

01:28:31.340 --> 01:28:33.551
Sorry. Sorry.

01:28:45.855 --> 01:28:48.107
Oh.

01:28:48.191 --> 01:28:51.861
I brought it down for you.
Peace offering.

01:28:56.741 --> 01:28:59.827
You've done so much for us.
We couldn't be happier.

01:28:59.911 --> 01:29:02.497
- How...? How...?
- Asteroids.

01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:05.958
Most of that will just buff right out.

01:29:10.629 --> 01:29:13.340
- I'll fix that.
- I could trick it out for you.

01:29:13.423 --> 01:29:16.927
Rocket launchers, laser cannons,
voice-activated battle armor.

01:29:17.010 --> 01:29:19.262
Do you hear something?

01:29:19.346 --> 01:29:21.807
- No.
- There's a 747 in trouble.

01:29:21.890 --> 01:29:24.601
It's a 727. Time to go to work.

01:29:25.602 --> 01:29:28.105
You need a hand?

01:29:29.064 --> 01:29:31.566
- A hand?
- Yeah, any help?

01:29:32.609 --> 01:29:35.404
I never had any help.

01:29:35.487 --> 01:29:38.073
- Could be some heavy lifting.
- Yeah?

01:29:38.156 --> 01:29:40.033
- OK.
- Yeah? Really?

01:29:40.117 --> 01:29:43.911
- Yes.
