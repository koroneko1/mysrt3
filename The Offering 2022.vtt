No more.

03:49.533 --> 03:52.275
[Yosille] I will never feed you
again.

03:52.319 --> 03:53.711
Very well.

Hey...

05:52.177 --> 05:54.049
Means a lot that you came.

05:56.486 --> 05:57.574
Claire, you can say it.

05:58.445 --> 06:01.056
What?

06:01.099 --> 06:03.101
[in Yiddish accent] "Art may
love you, but you,

06:03.145 --> 06:05.408
you will neverbe family."

06:05.452 --> 06:07.062
He said that.

06:07.105 --> 06:08.716
Yeah he said a lot of crazy
shit.

06:09.847 --> 06:12.067
This time will be different.

06:12.110 --> 06:13.808
[Art] He's loosened the
Yarmulke.

06:13.851 --> 06:15.940
Trust me, he's changed.

06:15.984 --> 06:17.028
[Claire] I hope so.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.814
Just don't forget,

06:19.857 --> 06:21.903
you're carrying his only
grandkid.

06:21.946 --> 06:23.774
It'd be a bad idea to
piss you off.

06:23.818 --> 06:25.733
Hmm, that's right.

06:25.776 --> 06:28.083
Just give the old man a chance.

06:28.126 --> 06:30.259
I'm here, aren't I?

06:30.302 --> 06:31.956
Yes you are.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.044

06:34.481 --> 06:35.699

07:15.260 --> 07:17.393
[man] All the holy
books and scriptures

07:17.437 --> 07:20.048
does not always
prepares us

07:20.091 --> 07:22.442
for tragedies
such as this.

07:22.485 --> 07:24.531
Chazal teaches us,

07:24.574 --> 07:27.142
that in the beginning God spoke.

07:27.185 --> 07:29.623
and with these
holy letters

07:29.666 --> 07:33.148
created the Universe.

07:33.191 --> 07:35.542
From the blade of grass
to the burning stars

07:35.585 --> 07:37.369
that shine above us,

07:37.413 --> 07:40.111
all made of his holy letters

07:40.155 --> 07:42.723
spoken at the
beginning of time.

07:44.159 --> 07:46.291
A man of heavenly perspective

07:46.335 --> 07:49.773
restores the letters of
creation.

07:49.817 --> 07:52.907
[Rabbi] But in times of tragedy

07:52.950 --> 07:54.517
who can say that...

07:55.866 --> 07:57.825
How did you grow up like this?

07:57.868 --> 07:59.348
It was a laugh a minute.

07:59.391 --> 08:00.349
[shushes]

08:01.132 --> 08:02.525
Ah, I'm so sorry

08:02.569 --> 08:04.309
[Claire] I didn't mean to um...

08:04.353 --> 08:05.572
[door shutting]

08:05.615 --> 08:07.095
Great start.

08:07.138 --> 08:08.357
Yeah, very good.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.098
[male voice] Don't take it
to heart.

08:10.141 --> 08:13.667
Death can bring out
the worst in people.

08:13.710 --> 08:16.887
[footsteps]

08:16.931 --> 08:19.063
[man] Welcome home, son.

08:19.107 --> 08:20.282
It's good to see you dad.

08:23.894 --> 08:26.070
God, did I miss you.

08:29.857 --> 08:35.906
And you-- the famous
Claire. Britain's finest.

08:37.995 --> 08:38.996
[scoffs]

08:39.649 --> 08:40.868
It's fine.

08:40.911 --> 08:41.912
Oh!

08:43.087 --> 08:45.220
We're family, right?

08:47.875 --> 08:49.267
So, um...

08:50.660 --> 08:52.183
Come and see your room.

08:52.227 --> 08:57.014
[piano music]

08:57.058 --> 08:58.625
[cutlery clinking]

08:58.668 --> 09:00.801
[Claire] Mmm! Oh my God.

09:00.844 --> 09:02.019
[Dad] Good, no?

09:02.063 --> 09:03.673
[Claire] Good? This is
delicious!

09:03.717 --> 09:05.545
Did you make this?

09:05.588 --> 09:06.894
I've never had a
dumpling that's--

09:06.937 --> 09:08.548
No, no, no not dumpling.

09:08.591 --> 09:10.593
- Kreplach.
-Ah,kreplach.

09:10.637 --> 09:11.681
That's very good!

09:11.725 --> 09:13.944
So, um, tell me.

09:13.988 --> 09:15.293
Boy? Girl?

09:17.861 --> 09:19.254
Ah, it's a girl.

09:19.297 --> 09:20.690
Ah!

09:20.734 --> 09:23.998
Perhaps she can learn to
write like her mother.

09:24.041 --> 09:25.303
You read my articles?

09:25.347 --> 09:26.783
I did a little digging.

09:26.827 --> 09:29.220
Oh, it's just light
editorial work.

09:29.264 --> 09:30.787
She's being modest.

09:30.831 --> 09:32.572
Claire's a great writer.

09:32.615 --> 09:34.617
On her way to writing a
cookbook for the ages.

09:34.661 --> 09:35.705
[giggle]

09:35.749 --> 09:37.577
And she likes my kreplach?

09:37.620 --> 09:39.013
Y'know

09:39.056 --> 09:41.842
Food connects the body to
the soul so they say.

09:41.885 --> 09:42.625
[phone buzzing]

09:42.669 --> 09:43.844
[Claire] That's lovely.

09:43.887 --> 09:44.888
Hmm?

09:46.237 --> 09:47.891
Uh hmm.

09:47.935 --> 09:48.979
I'm just gonna uh...

09:49.023 --> 09:50.154
Excuse me.

09:52.026 --> 09:54.158
[footsteps]

09:57.945 --> 09:59.468
I should've gone to your
wedding.

10:01.818 --> 10:03.777
When you see the world a
certain way,

10:05.605 --> 10:07.519
it's not easy to accept change.

10:09.565 --> 10:11.523
I'm sorry.

10:11.567 --> 10:13.308
-It's alright.
-No.

10:14.135 --> 10:15.484
No, it's not.

10:18.443 --> 10:19.619
Well,

10:20.881 --> 10:22.056
We're here now.

10:22.752 --> 10:23.884
Yeah.

10:27.801 --> 10:29.237
Did you show them the contract?

10:29.280 --> 10:31.761
[male voice]What contract?
Until your Dad signs

10:31.805 --> 10:34.808
his house cannot be used as
collateral.

10:34.851 --> 10:37.462
Just, uh-- tell them his
lawyer's looking over

10:37.506 --> 10:39.813
the finer details as we speak.
We're closing soon.

10:39.856 --> 10:41.597
[male voice]Soon is not
gonna cut it.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.686
I know Claire's invitro
nearly wiped you out

10:43.730 --> 10:45.732
but the bank doesn't give a
shit.

10:45.775 --> 10:47.255
How long have I got?

10:47.298 --> 10:48.996
[male voice]Without your dad's
house on the line,

10:49.039 --> 10:50.693
you've got no leverage.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.652
At this point, Art,

10:52.695 --> 10:54.175
if you don't get his
signature by the end of the
week,

10:54.218 --> 10:57.439
rest assured, the bank
will take your home.

10:57.482 --> 10:59.049
Oh, and this, this is
our backyard.

10:59.093 --> 11:00.572
No.

11:00.616 --> 11:02.270
You would be amazed at
the size of the lemons we grow.

11:02.313 --> 11:06.404
That's beautiful. That's
just beautiful.

11:06.448 --> 11:08.885
You know, my father,
alav ha-shalom,

11:08.929 --> 11:12.106
always used to say, "the
home, is the heart."

11:12.149 --> 11:15.718
Open home, open heart.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.198
You're gonna have a
very lucky kid.

11:22.377 --> 11:23.378
[sighs]

11:24.205 --> 11:26.033
[eerie music]

11:26.076 --> 11:27.817
[Dad] I should probably
move that.

11:28.905 --> 11:30.124
What happened to her?

11:31.168 --> 11:32.604
[puffs]

11:32.648 --> 11:36.739
What can I say, her name
was Sarah Scheindal.

11:36.783 --> 11:40.743
We prayed, we hoped, we...
searched.

11:40.787 --> 11:42.789
And eventually we found her.

11:45.182 --> 11:47.097
Yeah, it was terrible.
Just terrible.

11:48.620 --> 11:50.492
You don't need to know.
That's enough of all this.

11:52.233 --> 11:53.669
Sorry, I was just um--

11:53.713 --> 11:56.933
Well your wife has
just been showing me pictures.

11:56.977 --> 12:00.676
Such a home. My son, the
real estate machor.

12:00.720 --> 12:01.764
[laughing]

12:04.201 --> 12:06.726
To new beginnings, hmm?

12:07.901 --> 12:09.206
L'chaim.

12:09.250 --> 12:10.251
- L'chaim.
-L'chaim.

12:10.817 --> 12:12.035
To life.

12:12.079 --> 12:13.428
To life.

12:14.777 --> 12:15.996
[buzzer sounding]

12:16.039 --> 12:19.042
Oh! That must be Heimish.

12:19.086 --> 12:21.262
No rest for the wicked!

12:21.305 --> 12:24.700
[buzzer sounding repeatedly]

12:24.744 --> 12:25.527
HEIMISH] [Heimish] Did the
schmuck arrive?

12:25.570 --> 12:27.181
It's open! It's open!

12:28.704 --> 12:31.272
Even the dead are impatient.

12:31.315 --> 12:32.490
[hangs up phone]

12:34.057 --> 12:35.363
[Dad] Now...

12:36.625 --> 12:38.061
You wanna do a mitzvah?

12:40.498 --> 12:42.500
[elevator door opens]

12:45.025 --> 12:47.027
[footsteps]

12:54.556 --> 12:55.775
[switch clicks]

12:57.515 --> 12:59.213
[doors creak open]

13:00.780 --> 13:02.651
[doors swinging shut]

13:02.694 --> 13:04.087
[doors bump]

13:06.481 --> 13:08.135
[wheels squeaking]

13:08.178 --> 13:10.485
HEIMISH] Well look who it is,
huh?

13:10.528 --> 13:12.182
HEIMISH] The prodigal son
returns.

13:13.836 --> 13:14.794
HEIMISH] How you
doin', boychik?

13:17.448 --> 13:19.015
Good to see you, Heimish.

13:19.059 --> 13:20.582
I heard you
piped a shiksa.

13:20.625 --> 13:22.802
Don't worry, we'll convert her.

13:22.845 --> 13:24.760
Heimish. Behave.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.501
[doors opening]

13:26.544 --> 13:28.372
[bag thumps]

13:28.416 --> 13:31.114
So, Reb'' Arthur, what
brings you to Brooklyn?

13:31.158 --> 13:33.160
You miss my kugel?

13:33.203 --> 13:34.683
Call my wife
a shiksaagain,

13:34.726 --> 13:37.338
I'll cock you
in the mouth.

13:37.381 --> 13:39.688
What? You come to make
peace before the baby's born?

13:41.385 --> 13:43.257
That's very wise.

13:43.300 --> 13:45.302
[Heimish] Look at you, the great
business machor

13:45.346 --> 13:47.130
helping us with the grunt work.

13:47.174 --> 13:48.915
Such humility, Arthur.

13:48.958 --> 13:50.046
[water running]

13:50.090 --> 13:51.221
You're an idiot.

13:52.570 --> 13:53.615
You smell that?

13:55.399 --> 13:57.053
It smells like chazer.

13:57.097 --> 13:58.185
[water stops running]

13:58.228 --> 14:00.187
You got a problem with my diet?

14:00.230 --> 14:03.581
I wasn't talking about
your diet, boychik.

14:03.625 --> 14:06.367
-[door opens]
-[Dad] Something wrong?

14:06.410 --> 14:09.109
Nothing at all. Right Arthur?

14:10.762 --> 14:11.981
[Art] Nothing.

14:12.025 --> 14:13.853
Just like old times.

14:16.116 --> 14:17.204
[body bag unzipping]

14:19.859 --> 14:21.425
Oi...

14:21.469 --> 14:23.210
What happened?

14:23.253 --> 14:24.167
Nebach.

14:24.211 --> 14:25.995
Sruli ruled it a suicide.

14:28.171 --> 14:29.564
You knew him?

14:29.607 --> 14:33.350
Yosille Fishbein.
Brilliant scholar.

14:33.394 --> 14:36.788
[Dad] After his wife
died, became a recluse.

14:36.832 --> 14:40.009
Last I heard, he got
lost in the esoteric.

14:40.053 --> 14:42.925
Desperate to contact
the wife on the other side.

14:45.101 --> 14:47.234
It was only a few months ago,

14:47.277 --> 14:49.497
that we did the funeral
for her.

14:49.540 --> 14:52.979
He tried everything
to save her life.

14:53.022 --> 14:54.545
What's a man without his wife?

14:57.766 --> 14:58.767
[Dad] A good man.

14:59.899 --> 15:00.856
[speaking Hebrew]

15:02.945 --> 15:04.773
[Dad] Such is life.

15:04.816 --> 15:06.079
What a riddle.

15:06.122 --> 15:07.689

15:15.958 --> 15:16.916

Sarah Scheindal's

15:21.311 --> 15:22.965
we're all good
on tomorrow.

15:23.009 --> 15:24.445
Good.

15:24.488 --> 15:25.925
You keep that
on your head.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.972
Some things never change.

15:30.016 --> 15:31.017

15:31.060 --> 15:33.106
Saul, can I have a quick word?

15:33.149 --> 15:34.498
[agreeable grunt]

15:34.542 --> 15:36.326
Go ahead. I''ll get it started.

15:37.893 --> 15:39.460
[Heimish] Don''t forget
tachrisim.

15:39.503 --> 15:41.288
[Saul] Ah, he knows, he knows.

15:41.331 --> 15:42.637
Ah, he's going to mess it up.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.552
He's not going to mess it up.

15:44.595 --> 15:46.032
Don't mess it up.

17:02.543 --> 17:04.066
You really don't find
it suspicious

17:04.110 --> 17:07.113
that he shows up
after all this time?

17:07.156 --> 17:09.245
You should've heard him on
the phone.

17:09.289 --> 17:11.334
He really wants to start again.

17:11.378 --> 17:14.294
It took a lot of growth
to come here.

17:14.337 --> 17:16.948
I know he's your son.

17:16.992 --> 17:19.734
But all is not butter
that comes from the cow.

17:19.777 --> 17:22.519
You don't have the heart of a
young man no more.

17:22.563 --> 17:23.607
Don't you love him?

17:23.651 --> 17:25.392
[groaning]

17:25.435 --> 17:27.785
Yeah, of course
I love him.

you alright?

18:31.632 --> 18:32.981
Yeah, everything's good.

18:33.024 --> 18:35.853
[Saul] You mess it up?

18:35.897 --> 18:39.205

Still scared of the dark?

18:49.432 --> 18:50.999
Boo!

Very funny--

18:52.174 --> 18:53.349
[Yosille gasps loudly]

Claire? Hmm?

19:24.728 --> 19:26.513
What? Did I do something wrong?

19:26.556 --> 19:27.949
No, no, no, no, no.

19:27.992 --> 19:31.648
I'll finish up here. We
can do the rest tomorrow.

19:32.823 --> 19:33.868
Go.

19:33.911 --> 19:35.043
Go and get some rest.

19:41.049 --> 19:42.746
Dad, can I ask you a question?

19:43.617 --> 19:44.661
Of course.

[somber music playing]

19:51.146 --> 19:52.234
I...

19:52.278 --> 19:53.366
Don't matter.
Another time.

19:55.194 --> 19:58.414
[Saul] Heimish takes good
care of me. You know?

19:58.458 --> 19:59.676
Try to get along.

20:01.548 --> 20:02.679
[Saul] Oh and Art...

27:01.663 --> 27:05.667
God asks Abraham to sacrifice

But we must ask,

27:06.799 --> 27:08.104
[phone ringing]

27:08.148 --> 27:10.150
[male voice]is this a God to
believe in?

27:10.193 --> 27:12.326
a God who plays cruel
mind games with his loyal
servants?

Hello, Reb Chayim?

27:23.250 --> 27:25.034
I-it's Saul.

27:25.078 --> 27:27.080
-[Chayim] Saul?
-Yes, I need a favor.

27:27.123 --> 27:28.298
Sure.

27:28.342 --> 27:29.473
[Saul]I may have found
something.

27:30.431 --> 27:34.130
Ayin, koof, dales.

27:34.174 --> 27:35.001
[Chayim] This is
on the knife?

27:35.044 --> 27:37.046
Yeah, this is
on the knife.

27:37.090 --> 27:38.787
Koof, dales,

27:38.831 --> 27:40.397
[Saul] and saf.

27:40.441 --> 27:41.747
It's an ancient warding
inscription.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.140
What, you know of this?

27:44.184 --> 27:49.189
It's a... one of God's
hidden names written backwords.

27:49.232 --> 27:51.365
[Chayim]It's for invoking
sheidim,

27:51.408 --> 27:52.975
and for sealing them.

27:53.019 --> 27:54.542
Sealing them?

27:54.585 --> 27:57.545
Yeah, often in a body, but uh...

27:57.588 --> 28:01.723
honestly Saul, I, I wouldn't pay
it too much attention.

28:01.767 --> 28:03.986
It's an old buba maisa.

28:04.030 --> 28:05.727
[Chayim] I mean,
today's world,

28:05.771 --> 28:07.816
[Chayim] who has the know-how
to seal a demon in a body?

28:07.860 --> 28:10.036
And what if someone did?

28:10.079 --> 28:11.167
Alright, look.

28:11.211 --> 28:13.169
Was there a pendant?

28:13.213 --> 28:14.257
[Saul] What?

28:14.301 --> 28:16.520
On the body.
Was there a pendant,

28:16.564 --> 28:19.567
an amulet of some sort,
preserving a holy letter?

28:19.610 --> 28:21.308
-No, no.
-You sure?

28:21.351 --> 28:23.702
Yes of course, just, just
the blade.

28:23.745 --> 28:25.660
So what's the drama?

28:25.704 --> 28:28.228
No pendant, no seal.

28:28.271 --> 28:29.708
Which means, there is
no way you picked up

28:29.751 --> 28:31.231
a body containing a demon.

28:31.274 --> 28:32.536
[Chayim] But say you did.

28:32.580 --> 28:34.669
[Chayim]the worst an
entity like this can do,

28:34.713 --> 28:35.844
is mess with your mind.

28:35.888 --> 28:38.107
It's powerless whilst
it's in a body.

28:38.151 --> 28:39.761
But honestly Saul,

28:39.805 --> 28:42.242
[Chayim]unless you're in the
business of burning bodies...

28:42.285 --> 28:43.591
I wouldn't
worry about it.

28:43.634 --> 28:45.071
Worse things have
happened to the Jews, Saul.

28:46.246 --> 28:47.595
[Chayim] OK?

28:47.638 --> 28:49.205
Have a good Shabbos.

28:49.249 --> 28:50.772
Have a good Shabbos.

28:50.816 --> 28:52.295
[Chayim] Alright, bye.

28:53.557 --> 28:55.211
[receptor down]

29:01.087 --> 29:02.566
Ah!

29:02.610 --> 29:04.177
Look who it is!

29:04.220 --> 29:05.265
What are you up to?

29:06.875 --> 29:08.398
Oh, just a little morning read.

29:10.705 --> 29:12.141
You haven't seen Art?

29:12.185 --> 29:14.709
Woke up early, offered to help.

29:15.275 --> 29:16.493
Really?

29:16.537 --> 29:18.234
Yeah, I don't know
what you've done with him.

29:18.278 --> 29:19.322
[Saul] Who knew?

29:20.802 --> 29:21.890
Hungry?

How are we holding?

33:58.645 --> 34:02.083

a message? I'm his assistant.

34:02.127 --> 34:03.519
[sigh]

34:03.563 --> 34:05.347
[Jake]Look, just let him
know that we met his terms,

34:05.391 --> 34:08.568
but the bank was clear.
He won't be getting a loan

34:08.611 --> 34:11.353
unless we have his father's
place as collateral.

34:11.397 --> 34:15.575
We need him to sign the
contracttonight or this deal
goes away.

34:15.618 --> 34:17.011
I'll be sure to tell him.

35:14.808 --> 35:15.852
Claire?

35:17.071 --> 35:18.159
[Saul] Look at you.

35:19.856 --> 35:22.250
[Saul] Every Friday night,

35:22.294 --> 35:24.905
the men sing to their
wives and...

35:24.948 --> 35:29.301
and tell them that beauty
is just a passing breath.

35:29.344 --> 35:32.565
But their kindness, their
humanity,

35:32.608 --> 35:35.437
that is what every soul
truly desires.

35:37.657 --> 35:39.659
We're a very misunderstood
people.

35:41.226 --> 35:43.402
It's the burden of investing so
much

35:43.445 --> 35:45.360
in internal meaning, it's...

35:46.666 --> 35:48.624
it's hard for outsiders to see.

35:49.973 --> 35:51.323
Y'know...

35:51.366 --> 35:53.238
comforting others didn't really,

35:57.764 --> 35:58.852
I...

35:58.895 --> 36:00.810
I should have...

36:00.854 --> 36:05.337

shouted less, I don't know.

36:05.380 --> 36:06.425
[inhales]

Sometimes,

36:08.078 --> 36:10.211
reflection comes too late.

36:10.255 --> 36:11.299
Hmm?

36:13.214 --> 36:14.346
Are you alright?

36:16.043 --> 36:19.220
Can I ask you something, Saul?

36:19.264 --> 36:20.656
Yeah, of course. Anything.

36:22.005 --> 36:23.920
Er...

36:23.964 --> 36:27.141
Do souls ever call out
to you for,

36:27.185 --> 36:28.186
for help?

36:30.100 --> 36:32.320
The dead are just like the
living, Claire.

36:33.278 --> 36:34.627
They still need love.

36:36.716 --> 36:37.978
[door slamming open]

36:38.021 --> 36:38.848
[Heimish] You know what
your son is up to Saul?

36:38.892 --> 36:40.241
[Art] Heimish!

36:40.285 --> 36:41.764
He things you're a
piece of toast to butter up.

36:41.808 --> 36:43.462
Go ahead, tell him!

36:43.505 --> 36:45.115
-Tell him!
-Tell me what?

36:45.159 --> 36:46.639
All this, it's
a game Saul!

36:47.466 --> 36:49.119
It's a game.

36:49.163 --> 36:50.164
He's a ganav.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.905
-What did you--
-A thief.

36:51.948 --> 36:53.341
That is not--

36:53.385 --> 36:54.255
They're selling this
whole place from under you--

36:54.299 --> 36:55.474
What? What you talking about--

36:55.517 --> 36:56.823
They didn't come here
to reconcile Saul.

36:56.866 --> 36:58.041
They came here to use you!

36:58.085 --> 37:00.130
That is not, that is not
true. Dad--

37:00.174 --> 37:02.611
He's committed your property to
some goyisheland
developer--

37:02.655 --> 37:03.830
That is not true!

37:03.873 --> 37:04.961
I'm sorry but th-that
is outrageous.

37:05.005 --> 37:06.528
That is not the case, ok Dad?

37:06.572 --> 37:07.573
-Yes it is!
-I can explain--

37:07.616 --> 37:08.661

37:21.021 --> 37:22.109

37:26.679 --> 37:28.115
-What was that?
-It doesn't matter.

37:28.158 --> 37:29.203
-Can you just--
-We're leaving.

37:29.247 --> 37:30.335
Can you just talk to me?

37:30.378 --> 37:32.293
Claire, can we do this later?

37:33.120 --> 37:35.209
No, we can't!

37:35.253 --> 37:36.863
[Claire closing suitcase shut]

37:36.906 --> 37:38.865
Everything's gonna be fine,
okay?

37:38.908 --> 37:40.258
Art, I want the truth.

37:52.661 --> 37:55.142
I haven't been able to
sell a house in two years.

37:59.277 --> 38:00.887
[scoff]

38:00.930 --> 38:03.324
It's okay, I talked to the bank,
refinanced the house--

38:03.368 --> 38:04.630
You refinanced the house?

38:07.720 --> 38:11.854
You told me that you had
everything under control.

38:11.898 --> 38:15.293
I-I left my job. I didn't have
to do that. You told me,

38:15.336 --> 38:16.990
that everything was okay.

38:17.033 --> 38:19.819
And then here I am, choosing
colours for the baby's room

38:19.862 --> 38:21.168
and picking furniture when we're
on the verge --

38:21.211 --> 38:22.387
We're not on the verge--

38:22.430 --> 38:24.302
You know, you were
lying to me for two years.

38:26.347 --> 38:29.611
We're supposed to be a
family. We're having a baby.

38:31.700 --> 38:34.442
What was your plan, Art?

38:34.486 --> 38:35.487
Huh?

38:35.530 --> 38:37.315
I mean, what were you thinking?

38:41.014 --> 38:43.321
Did you see his face downstairs?

38:49.109 --> 38:51.067
[Art] Let me tell you
about downstairs.

38:51.111 --> 38:54.593
That God, love and holiness.
That's a lie.

38:56.029 --> 38:58.553
I watched my mother rot
in that room,

38:58.597 --> 39:01.817
and when I needed him,
you know what he told me to do?

39:01.861 --> 39:04.080
He told me to go away
to synagogue and pray.

39:04.124 --> 39:05.691
So I prayed.

39:05.734 --> 39:08.781
I prayed and I prayed,
"God don't take her.

39:08.824 --> 39:12.088
God have mercy.
God don't hurt her!"

39:12.132 --> 39:13.394
I cried so much to God,

39:13.438 --> 39:15.396
there were no more words
left on the page.

39:16.092 --> 39:17.398
[weeping]

39:17.442 --> 39:20.053
[Claire] You need to go
down there and talk to him

39:20.096 --> 39:22.185
and make this right.

39:22.229 --> 39:24.362
If we leave now, you'll
always regret it.

39:26.494 --> 39:28.975
[sniffing]

39:29.018 --> 39:30.672
I didn't come here to
butter him up

39:30.716 --> 39:31.978
[Art] Okay? I-

39:32.021 --> 39:33.588
I wasn't going to sell
the house from under him.

39:33.632 --> 39:35.242
[sniffing]

39:35.285 --> 39:38.419
I just needed to find the right
moment to ask him face to face.

39:38.463 --> 39:40.116
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

39:42.902 --> 39:44.294
[Arthur] I'm sorry.

39:47.210 --> 39:48.386

1:04:17.810 --> 1:04:21.292

Why Yosille?

1:04:51.061 --> 1:04:53.454
[Aida] He should have listened.

1:04:53.498 --> 1:04:55.674
What have you done to me?

1:04:55.717 --> 1:04:58.851
Not me, your dream.

1:05:37.672 --> 1:05:40.327
From this, will
you suffer?

This, this thing...

1:12:41.444 --> 1:12:42.488
it's in the house?

1:12:44.185 --> 1:12:45.361
I think so.

1:12:48.059 --> 1:12:50.278

1:13:29.666 --> 1:13:32.625
[ominous music]

1:13:32.669 --> 1:13:36.412
An altar, a sacrificial
altar to those who enter it.

1:13:40.024 --> 1:13:41.417
Did you feed it?

1:13:42.374 --> 1:13:43.375
What?

1:13:43.419 --> 1:13:45.246
Did your wife go in this sigil?

1:13:55.561 --> 1:13:58.303
[haunting music]

1:13:58.346 --> 1:14:00.261
It's been freed.

1:14:00.305 --> 1:14:01.480
It's vessel's been shattered.

1:14:01.524 --> 1:14:02.916
What is this thing?

1:14:06.093 --> 1:14:07.443
Bringer of miscarriages.

1:14:09.967 --> 1:14:11.098
Taker of children.

1:14:11.142 --> 1:14:12.186
[light bulbs exploding]

1:14:16.103 --> 1:14:17.714
[hurried footsteps]

1:14:17.757 --> 1:14:21.195
I must finish, what
Yosille started!

1:14:21.239 --> 1:14:22.545
Where's the rest of it?

1:14:22.588 --> 1:14:24.460
-I--
-Where's the rest of it?

1:14:27.245 --> 1:14:30.770
Since before the era of
concealment,

1:14:30.814 --> 1:14:35.035
Abyzou has been inflicting
misery and miscarriage

1:14:35.079 --> 1:14:39.039
forcing the bereaved and
the desperate to feed it.

1:14:39.083 --> 1:14:40.432
Until God intervened,

1:14:41.868 --> 1:14:43.261
and called upon Abraham to...

1:14:44.131 --> 1:14:46.046
sacrifice his son.

1:14:46.090 --> 1:14:47.570
CHAYIM] [Chayim] Forever binding
Abyzou.

1:14:48.745 --> 1:14:50.703
Until Yosille brought it back.

1:14:52.009 --> 1:14:54.402
It'll make you see things.

1:14:54.446 --> 1:14:56.535
Feel things that aren't real.

1:14:56.579 --> 1:14:58.842
Whatever it takes to get what it
wants.

1:14:58.885 --> 1:15:01.105
A child inside that sigil.

1:15:01.148 --> 1:15:02.280
[ashes scattering]

1:15:02.323 --> 1:15:05.501
But with this pendant, we can
bind it,

1:15:05.544 --> 1:15:08.155
and our prayers will force it
inside.

1:15:10.157 --> 1:15:12.812
Only we determine how much good,

1:15:12.856 --> 1:15:14.858
and evil enter our realm.

1:15:16.207 --> 1:15:17.600
So how do I kill it?

1:15:17.643 --> 1:15:18.992
[footsteps]

1:15:19.036 --> 1:15:20.211
There is no kill.

1:15:20.254 --> 1:15:22.430
[haunting music]

1:15:23.388 --> 1:15:24.563
You trap it.

1:15:24.607 --> 1:15:25.956
