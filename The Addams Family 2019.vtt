00:38.329 --> 00:39.562
<i>There's no bell</i>

00:39.564 --> 00:42.330
<i>When you call for me</i>

00:42.332 --> 00:45.401
<i>You'll be falling for miles</i>

00:46.503 --> 00:49.908
<i>I'm bewitched by your misery</i>

00:51.408 --> 00:54.977
<i>But I love it when you smile</i>

00:54.979 --> 00:57.915
<i>Let me know
what you want from me</i>

00:59.082 --> 01:02.851
<i>Whisper "love" in my ears</i>

01:02.853 --> 01:05.790
<i>Before you try
to get your hooks in me</i>

01:07.591 --> 01:11.860
<i>I should warn you, my dear</i>

01:11.862 --> 01:15.263
<i>My heart is a haunted house</i>

01:15.265 --> 01:19.200
<i>Once you're in,
you ain't getting out</i>

01:19.202 --> 01:23.238
<i>It's the trap
you've been waiting for</i>

01:23.240 --> 01:26.974
<i>Ain't no windows,
ain't no doors</i>

01:26.976 --> 01:30.115
<i>No escaping the way you feel</i>

01:31.749 --> 01:35.283
<i>It's like a dream,
but you hope it's real</i>

01:35.285 --> 01:39.155
<i>My, my, my heart</i>

01:39.157 --> 01:45.093
- <i>M-m-m-my heart is a haunted</i>
- <i>Haunted house</i>

01:46.997 --> 01:50.800
<i>M-m-m-my heart is a haunted</i>

01:50.802 --> 01:53.171
<i>Haunted house</i>

02:12.022 --> 02:13.754
My love.

02:13.756 --> 02:15.991
<i>Cara mia.</i>

02:15.993 --> 02:18.862
The ring! The ring!
Oh, no! No, no, no!

02:27.004 --> 02:30.341
Oh, Thing!
Best hand always has the ring!

02:40.384 --> 02:42.717
Dearly be-loathed,

02:42.719 --> 02:46.721
it is indeed a rare privilege
to see our family

02:46.723 --> 02:50.358
gathered together
for this Addams tradition.

02:50.360 --> 02:52.661
To commence this ceremony

02:52.663 --> 02:54.196
and deliver these two

02:54.198 --> 02:58.234
into the yawning void
of matrimony,

02:58.236 --> 03:02.874
we put the lime in the coconut
and drink them both up.

03:10.313 --> 03:12.547
I now pronounce you...

03:12.549 --> 03:13.916
- Monsters!
- Freaks!

03:13.918 --> 03:15.016
Get out, Addams!

03:15.018 --> 03:16.184
You've been here
long enough!

03:16.186 --> 03:17.887
We've had
enough of your kind!

03:17.889 --> 03:19.354
Addams aren't wanted here!

03:19.356 --> 03:20.822
Leave already!

03:20.824 --> 03:22.557
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

03:22.559 --> 03:23.726
Quick, put the lime
in the coconut

03:23.728 --> 03:25.193
and drink 'em both up!

03:29.498 --> 03:31.432
Sorry, I couldn't help myself.

03:31.434 --> 03:32.836
This is our home!

03:33.871 --> 03:35.037
You're not wanted!

03:35.039 --> 03:36.238
We don't want you here!

03:36.240 --> 03:39.076
Everyone, to the bridge!

03:42.445 --> 03:43.611
Fire!

03:43.613 --> 03:44.782
Fire!

04:00.598 --> 04:02.764
You two love bats
better fly out of here!

04:02.766 --> 04:04.633
I'll hold them off!

04:04.635 --> 04:06.067
Mazurka!

04:09.606 --> 04:11.375
Grab onto my hairy hump!

04:16.813 --> 04:19.547
I think I can see
my house from here.

04:19.548 --> 04:22.217
Oh, no.
That's a women's prison.

04:22.219 --> 04:25.253
Oh, Gomez, why do hordes
of angry villagers

04:25.255 --> 04:26.821
follow us everywhere we go?

04:26.823 --> 04:30.424
We are safe, my love,
that is all that matters.

04:30.426 --> 04:32.260
I want to find a new home

04:32.262 --> 04:34.296
that is shrouded
from the world.

04:34.298 --> 04:37.299
Someplace that is truly us.

04:37.301 --> 04:41.001
Yes! Somewhere horrible!
Somewhere corrupt!

04:41.003 --> 04:43.237
Somewhere that no one
in their right mind

04:43.239 --> 04:45.008
would be caught dead in!

04:55.786 --> 04:57.518
Unhappy, darling?

04:57.520 --> 05:00.255
Yes, completely.

05:00.257 --> 05:03.592
Oh, Gomez,
you have torn down my walls

05:03.594 --> 05:06.294
and stabbed your name
onto my heart.

05:08.097 --> 05:10.131
My wan temptress,

05:10.133 --> 05:12.202
your hand is as cold
as a dead fish.

05:12.868 --> 05:15.804
My love, that is a dead fish.

05:15.806 --> 05:17.272
Mmm, mmm...

05:17.274 --> 05:18.543
So it is.

05:23.546 --> 05:25.046
Darling,

05:25.048 --> 05:28.850
is that a wrinkle
I see on your pallid brow?

05:28.852 --> 05:30.051
What's wrong?

05:30.053 --> 05:32.188
We can't run forever, my love.

05:32.190 --> 05:34.056
I want a home again.

05:34.058 --> 05:36.792
I want our children
to grow up in peace.

05:36.794 --> 05:39.294
I want to pick out
cemetery plots.

05:39.296 --> 05:43.231
Morticia, I swear on my life
I will find us a new home.

05:43.233 --> 05:45.503
And your every wish
shall be granted.

05:46.135 --> 05:47.736
<i>Mon amour.</i>

05:47.738 --> 05:52.073
French. You know
what that does to me.

05:53.544 --> 05:55.413
<i>Wild thing</i>

05:57.380 --> 05:58.648
<i>You make my heart...</i>

06:07.058 --> 06:08.926
We hit something!

06:16.666 --> 06:18.868
Is he all right?

06:18.870 --> 06:21.436
No, he seems
perfectly demented.

06:21.438 --> 06:25.407
"State Hospital for
the Criminally Insane."

06:25.409 --> 06:26.944
Gomez.

06:30.948 --> 06:32.679
That must be
the asylum.

06:32.681 --> 06:34.215
Oh, thank goodness.

06:34.217 --> 06:36.684
A decent place
to sleep for the night.

06:41.424 --> 06:42.426
Hmm?

06:43.294 --> 06:45.695
Thank you, old boy.
Lead the way.

07:03.479 --> 07:06.080
It's quiet. Too quiet.

07:06.082 --> 07:07.652
Must be the off-season.

07:16.661 --> 07:17.728
Hello?

07:21.799 --> 07:23.164
There's no one here.

07:23.166 --> 07:25.400
Could it be abandoned?

07:25.402 --> 07:28.135
It's creepy. Kooky.

07:28.137 --> 07:31.075
Mysterious. Spooky.

07:41.017 --> 07:42.486
Huh?

08:28.832 --> 08:33.037
<i>Get out!</i>

08:34.703 --> 08:36.071
It's hideous.

08:36.073 --> 08:37.573
It's horrible.

08:38.207 --> 08:40.307
It's home.

10:24.414 --> 10:27.351
What a lovely morning!

10:30.319 --> 10:31.485
Nice try.

10:31.487 --> 10:35.322
<i>Get out!</i>

10:35.324 --> 10:38.628
Oh, you're always so grumpy
before your morning coffee.

10:47.837 --> 10:48.970
Better?

11:06.856 --> 11:07.955
<i>Lurch,</i>

11:07.957 --> 11:09.125
<i>it's time for breakfast.</i>

11:27.812 --> 11:29.844
Thing.

11:29.846 --> 11:32.650
Have Ichabod
wake the children.

11:35.752 --> 11:38.552
Lurch, would you mind
dusting the house?

11:38.554 --> 11:39.856
Mmm.

11:47.930 --> 11:49.830
Slowly, Cleopatra.

11:49.832 --> 11:52.736
I wouldn't want my favorite
African Strangler to choke.

12:34.712 --> 12:37.778
All right, Ichabod. I'm awake.

12:37.780 --> 12:39.717
Not for long.

12:40.951 --> 12:42.749
Real mature, Pugsley.

12:42.751 --> 12:44.119
Oh, please.

12:44.121 --> 12:46.321
You never threw an axe
when you were my age?

12:46.323 --> 12:50.093
Of course I did.
I never missed.

12:52.563 --> 12:54.262
How I wish something
would liven up

12:54.264 --> 12:56.064
this already tedious day.

13:00.236 --> 13:01.771
Thanks for trying, Ichabod.

13:22.525 --> 13:23.760
Hmm.

13:49.653 --> 13:50.784
<i>Pugsley?</i>

13:50.786 --> 13:54.321
Pugsley! It's time
for sword practice.

13:54.323 --> 13:55.956
Pugsley!

13:55.958 --> 13:57.627
Let the games begin.

14:25.154 --> 14:28.058
Here's Pugsley!

14:44.874 --> 14:47.378
All right, son.
That's enough.

14:48.944 --> 14:51.748
They blow up
so fast these days.

15:02.458 --> 15:04.627
Don't make me come up there!

15:11.068 --> 15:12.803
This is your last warning!

15:25.215 --> 15:27.983
My head. Ow, ow, ow.

15:27.985 --> 15:31.418
Pugsley, we're supposed to be
working on your swordplay.

15:31.420 --> 15:33.622
Your Sabre Mazurka
is two weeks away,

15:33.624 --> 15:35.623
and you've barely
practiced at all.

15:35.625 --> 15:37.825
So I missed one practice.
What's the big deal?

15:37.827 --> 15:39.761
The big deal?

15:39.763 --> 15:42.397
The Sabre Mazurka
is the most important day

15:42.399 --> 15:43.663
in a young man's life.

15:43.665 --> 15:45.167
It's what makes you an Addams.

15:45.169 --> 15:48.268
It's the day your entire
family gathers around you

15:48.270 --> 15:51.772
and passes judgment on
your worth as a human being.

15:51.774 --> 15:53.273
I hear it's like Thanksgiving.

15:53.275 --> 15:56.243
But swords
are so old-fashioned.

15:56.245 --> 15:58.113
I'm more of a demolitions man.

15:58.115 --> 16:02.653
Explosives have no place
in a Mazurka. Hand them over.

16:06.122 --> 16:08.156
All of them.

16:08.158 --> 16:10.157
And the TNT.

16:10.159 --> 16:11.960
And the M-80s.

16:11.962 --> 16:15.363
Roman candles. Bang snaps.
Holy Hand Grenades.

16:16.832 --> 16:21.536
Son, our family hasn't been
all together in 13 years.

16:21.538 --> 16:23.638
They are coming
from all over the world

16:23.640 --> 16:25.974
to see you
on your special day.

16:25.976 --> 16:28.011
I just want it
to go perfectly.

16:28.977 --> 16:30.979
All right, Pop.
I'll practice.

16:30.981 --> 16:32.513
That's my boy.

16:38.054 --> 16:40.287
Putrid.

16:40.289 --> 16:41.690
Mmm. Horrifying.

16:41.692 --> 16:43.060
I call spleen.

16:45.495 --> 16:46.694
Mmm...

16:46.696 --> 16:48.162
- Ah, ow...
- Wednesday.

16:48.164 --> 16:49.830
Please, no ink stains
on the table.

16:49.832 --> 16:51.733
Yes, Mother.

16:55.471 --> 16:57.205
Gomez, everyone we've invited

16:57.207 --> 16:58.906
to the Mazurka
has threatened to come.

16:58.908 --> 17:01.808
I know. Isn't it wonderful?

17:02.913 --> 17:06.146
All Addamses
under one roof again.

17:06.148 --> 17:07.915
Yes, but where will
everyone sleep?

17:07.917 --> 17:10.349
We'll have Lurch fix up
the mausoleum.

17:10.352 --> 17:11.852
It'll be like
sleepaway camp.

17:13.122 --> 17:15.388
Very well, darling.

17:18.896 --> 17:20.194
Uncle Fester!

17:20.195 --> 17:21.862
Brother!

17:24.935 --> 17:26.233
Don't worry, I'm okay.

17:26.236 --> 17:28.336
The plate glass window
broke my fall.

17:28.338 --> 17:30.737
Ha! Ha!

17:30.739 --> 17:32.573
<i>Rick'em,
rack'em, roar'em, buzz</i>

17:32.575 --> 17:34.542
<i>Addams is as Addams does</i>

17:37.080 --> 17:39.214
I am thrilled you're here!

17:40.551 --> 17:41.949
I'm not late, am I?

17:41.951 --> 17:44.651
Actually, we weren't expecting
you for another two weeks.

17:44.653 --> 17:46.521
Huh. So, not late.

17:46.523 --> 17:48.055
I apologize, darling.

17:48.057 --> 17:50.124
You see,
I asked Fester to come early

17:50.126 --> 17:52.627
to help Pugsley
with his Mazurka practice.

17:52.629 --> 17:54.395
Hey!

17:54.397 --> 17:55.463
No! No!

17:55.465 --> 17:57.764
Bad Kitty!
That's a bad Kitty!

17:57.766 --> 17:59.032
If I'd known you were coming,

17:59.034 --> 18:00.801
I would have prepared
the dungeon.

18:00.803 --> 18:03.704
Please, don't worry.
I'll sleep in the attic.

18:03.706 --> 18:05.438
You won't even know I'm here.

18:05.440 --> 18:09.744
I've practiced that move
in a lot of people's homes.

18:09.746 --> 18:12.213
Uncle,

18:12.215 --> 18:14.682
can you tell us
what's beyond the gate?

18:17.586 --> 18:20.054
Why ever would you
ask that, dear?

18:20.056 --> 18:22.523
I heard a strange noise
in the fog earlier,

18:22.525 --> 18:24.157
and I should like
to investigate.

18:24.159 --> 18:26.327
There's nothing out there
but boring marshland.

18:26.329 --> 18:29.597
There must be something.
We never go anywhere.

18:29.599 --> 18:32.332
Who knows the untold horrors
we're missing out on.

18:32.334 --> 18:34.269
Darling,
we have all the horror

18:34.271 --> 18:35.436
we need, right here.

18:35.438 --> 18:38.472
Uncle Fester can go
wherever he likes.

18:38.474 --> 18:40.375
Now, now,
there are some restrictions.

18:40.377 --> 18:42.444
You know,
I can't go to the mall,

18:42.446 --> 18:44.512
or a zoo, or a building...

18:44.514 --> 18:45.612
When you're older,

18:45.614 --> 18:47.314
you can travel
to your heart's content.

18:47.316 --> 18:50.120
But for now,
it's safer for you here.

18:52.022 --> 18:53.524
Socrates, come.

18:55.191 --> 18:57.657
...South America,
Europe, China,

18:57.659 --> 19:00.360
Asia, most parts of Africa.

19:00.362 --> 19:02.332
I'm allowed in Antarctica!

19:15.445 --> 19:16.677
<i>You're watching</i>

19:16.679 --> 19:18.948
<i>Home, Art
and Garden television.</i>

19:20.850 --> 19:23.818
The world's a big place,
full of poor souls

19:23.820 --> 19:26.853
who don't know the difference
between shiplap and Shinola.

19:26.855 --> 19:28.455
Well, I'm here to help.

19:29.959 --> 19:33.060
<i>I take your
uninspired living space</i>

19:33.062 --> 19:36.129
<i>and turn it into the perfect
palace of your dreams.</i>

19:36.131 --> 19:39.902
No matter how outdated your
design sense, I can help you.

19:40.669 --> 19:42.203
<i>My only flaw?</i>

19:42.205 --> 19:44.171
<i>Sometimes I care too much.</i>

19:45.342 --> 19:47.308
I'm Margaux Needler,

19:47.310 --> 19:51.212
and I'm about to stage
a <i>Design Intervention!</i>

19:51.214 --> 19:53.580
You're welcome in advance.

19:53.582 --> 19:55.550
Today, we're putting
the finishing touches

19:55.552 --> 19:57.718
on our biggest project yet.

19:57.720 --> 19:59.387
Assimilation.

19:59.389 --> 20:01.421
We didn't just
make over a house.

20:01.423 --> 20:04.360
We made over a whole town!

20:05.428 --> 20:07.895
And in just two weeks,
on our live season finale,

20:07.897 --> 20:09.030
you will be able to buy

20:09.032 --> 20:10.599
your very own
piece of Assimilation.

20:10.601 --> 20:11.698
That's right!

20:11.700 --> 20:13.734
In a <i>Design Intervention</i>
first,

20:13.736 --> 20:17.204
we are putting a whole
neighborhood up for sale.

20:17.206 --> 20:19.005
This will be
your chance to purchase

20:19.007 --> 20:20.140
the house of your dreams

20:20.142 --> 20:22.275
in the town of your dreams!

20:22.277 --> 20:24.512
Sounds good?
I thought so.

20:24.514 --> 20:27.014
Welcome to Assimilation,
neighbor.

20:28.217 --> 20:29.550
<i>This program
brought to you</i>

20:29.552 --> 20:30.618
<i>by Neighborhood Peeps.</i>

20:30.620 --> 20:33.023
<i>Your neighbors are watching!</i>

20:33.922 --> 20:35.191
And, we're out!

20:36.191 --> 20:37.625
Love it. Perfect.

20:37.627 --> 20:39.494
Let's set up
for the walk-through.

20:39.496 --> 20:40.828
Margaux,
did that feel good to you?

20:40.830 --> 20:41.928
No, Glenn.

20:41.930 --> 20:44.299
We need more balloons,
more confetti.

20:44.301 --> 20:46.367
- Roger that.
- What are we selling here?

20:46.369 --> 20:49.436
Big dreams. You know
how you get big dreams?

20:49.438 --> 20:50.804
- Uh...
- With big ratings.

20:50.806 --> 20:52.072
- Got it.
- Double the balloons.

20:52.074 --> 20:53.907
And I want
a blizzard of confetti.

20:53.909 --> 20:55.475
I want so much confetti
that we need

20:55.477 --> 20:57.611
snow patrols
to find lost children.

20:57.613 --> 20:59.914
I bet my home improvement
empire on this town.

20:59.916 --> 21:01.381
Every house must sell

21:01.383 --> 21:02.715
or we're out of business!

21:02.717 --> 21:04.918
- It's got to be perfect!
- Mom!

21:04.920 --> 21:06.654
You're never
gonna believe this.

21:06.656 --> 21:07.754
What is it, Parker?

21:07.756 --> 21:10.558
I found a creepy mansion
up on the hill!

21:10.560 --> 21:11.992
I'm so glad you're exploring,
Parker,

21:11.994 --> 21:13.962
but I don't have time
to talk right now, sweetheart.

21:13.964 --> 21:15.596
Mama needs to help people.

21:15.598 --> 21:18.064
I need help.
Aren't I people?

21:18.066 --> 21:19.833
Oh, you're cute.

21:19.835 --> 21:21.836
Don't you have Chipper 'N'
Cheer practice this afternoon?

21:21.838 --> 21:23.138
Run along, honey.

21:23.140 --> 21:24.938
Now, Glenn, what are
the numbers we're expecting?

21:24.940 --> 21:26.340
- Well, if you look here...
- Mom!

21:27.643 --> 21:28.644
Ugh!

21:38.254 --> 21:40.524
Left a bit. Up a bit.

21:40.957 --> 21:43.090
Now, down a bit.

21:43.092 --> 21:45.495
Perfect.

21:46.329 --> 21:50.130
And three, two, one...

21:55.037 --> 21:57.472
You made me miss!

21:57.474 --> 22:00.942
Do you know how long
it took for me to set this up?

22:00.944 --> 22:02.842
Look, Pugsley...

22:02.844 --> 22:06.847
Your Mazurka's coming up,
and, well, you're not ready.

22:06.849 --> 22:09.516
Even if I am the only one
who sees it.

22:09.518 --> 22:11.552
So, pay attention,

22:11.554 --> 22:13.021
and you might actually
get through this.

22:13.023 --> 22:14.024
Wait.

22:14.724 --> 22:17.226
You're going to help me?

22:17.893 --> 22:18.993
Why?

22:18.995 --> 22:21.628
Because you are my brother.

22:21.630 --> 22:26.032
And... I love you.

22:31.040 --> 22:33.206
All right.
How are you gonna help me?

22:33.208 --> 22:35.209
You see that hole over there?

22:35.211 --> 22:36.679
Go stand beside it.

22:37.813 --> 22:39.546
Uh... That hole?

22:39.548 --> 22:40.982
That hole.

22:40.984 --> 22:42.884
Mmm...
I don't get it.

22:46.555 --> 22:47.890
Whoa.

22:59.468 --> 23:01.702
Darling, not to criticize,

23:01.704 --> 23:04.038
but is that really
as tight as you can make it?

23:04.040 --> 23:05.872
I'm sorry, Gomez.

23:05.874 --> 23:08.908
I'm just a bit preoccupied
with the Mazurka preparations.

23:08.910 --> 23:11.512
Oh, I am as well!

23:11.514 --> 23:13.981
I fear Pugsley
is overconfident

23:13.983 --> 23:16.016
and doesn't truly understand

23:16.018 --> 23:18.619
the importance
of this tradition.

23:18.621 --> 23:20.620
Good news, everybody.
Pugsley's gone.

23:20.622 --> 23:22.889
Wednesday,
I know that tone of voice.

23:22.891 --> 23:25.091
Dig up your brother. At once.

23:25.093 --> 23:26.726
You're weakening
the gene pool.

23:26.728 --> 23:28.094
Hold on.

23:28.096 --> 23:29.263
What do you have there?

23:29.265 --> 23:32.466
I'm not sure.
I like it.

23:32.468 --> 23:36.803
It's so... What's the word?
The opposite of sad?

23:36.805 --> 23:38.607
Darling, bring that to me.

23:41.611 --> 23:44.978
Strange, there's usually
a murderous clown

23:44.980 --> 23:47.214
attached to the other
end of these.

23:47.216 --> 23:50.083
Wednesday, don't move!

23:50.085 --> 23:55.222
What, in the name of
all that is unholy, is that?

23:55.224 --> 23:58.391
It tastes like cotton candy.

23:58.393 --> 24:00.293
How do you know
what cotton candy tastes like?

24:00.295 --> 24:02.763
Tish, it was my youth.
I made mistakes.

24:02.765 --> 24:05.465
Wednesday, wherever did
this pink thing come from?

24:05.467 --> 24:06.833
Outside.

24:06.835 --> 24:09.139
They're everywhere.

24:15.945 --> 24:19.346
Strangest weather
system I've ever seen.

24:25.188 --> 24:28.356
What is that?
Where's it coming from?

24:28.358 --> 24:29.756
Wait, wait, wait.

24:29.758 --> 24:32.292
The fog, it's lifting.

24:32.294 --> 24:34.028
Well, that would
only happen if...

24:34.030 --> 24:37.701
Someone drained the marsh.
But who?

24:40.336 --> 24:43.137
A town.
This is not good.

24:43.139 --> 24:44.371
We must go down there

24:44.373 --> 24:46.273
and introduce ourselves
at once.

24:46.275 --> 24:50.045
This day is becoming
most wonderfully disruptive.

25:03.458 --> 25:05.792
Let's keep going
with the run-through, okay?

25:05.794 --> 25:06.894
Welcome back.

25:06.896 --> 25:08.696
I'm so delighted
to show you my house.

25:08.698 --> 25:11.732
You can own one just like it,
just less large.

25:11.734 --> 25:14.635
Blah, blah, blah.
Sconces, crown molding.

25:14.637 --> 25:17.871
Which leads us to what I call
the Salon de Grandé.

25:17.873 --> 25:20.774
Cross here, turn,
and then say something like,

25:20.776 --> 25:22.743
"Now, before I show you
this view,

25:22.745 --> 25:24.378
"go to an antique store,

25:24.380 --> 25:26.981
"buy a chair,
and reupholster it.

25:26.983 --> 25:28.919
"'Cause you're gonna
wanna sit down for this."

25:31.853 --> 25:33.454
What? What's the matter?

25:33.456 --> 25:35.222
For heaven's sake,
what's going on?

25:35.224 --> 25:37.994
Do I have something
in my teeth? What is it?

25:47.370 --> 25:48.569
Not a single gargoyle.

25:48.571 --> 25:50.772
Maybe this isn't
such a bad thing.

25:50.774 --> 25:52.874
We have been
isolated here for a while.

25:52.876 --> 25:55.512
I could really
see myself dying here.

25:57.714 --> 25:59.080
Play nice, Kitty.

26:00.216 --> 26:02.183
Well, no one is running at us

26:02.185 --> 26:05.619
with torches and pitchforks,
so that's a plus.

26:05.621 --> 26:08.156
You know, darling,
I don't think we'll need

26:08.158 --> 26:09.924
to put the family
in the mausoleum.

26:09.926 --> 26:11.457
They can stay here!

26:11.459 --> 26:13.695
The family
would never be comfortable.

26:13.697 --> 26:14.794
It will be years

26:14.796 --> 26:16.798
before rust and decay set in.

26:16.800 --> 26:18.031
How you doing?

26:18.033 --> 26:20.303
It's all so... different.

26:21.771 --> 26:23.937
Pugsley, don't drink it all.

26:23.939 --> 26:26.573
This gentleman
wants some, too.

26:26.575 --> 26:28.408
Sir, it's all right.

26:28.410 --> 26:30.311
He's had all his shots!

26:30.313 --> 26:31.811
What a nervous man.

26:31.813 --> 26:34.815
Come on, Tish, let's
explore the neighborhood.

26:34.817 --> 26:36.483
I'm gonna pop in here
for two minutes

26:36.485 --> 26:38.985
and I'll meet you in
the town square. Agreed?

26:38.987 --> 26:40.090
Very well, darling.

26:40.989 --> 26:43.224
Good day, all.

26:44.494 --> 26:47.060
Don't let me interrupt
your cup of joe

26:47.062 --> 26:49.464
or whoever you have in there.

26:49.466 --> 26:53.934
So, what's dark and bitter
here other than yours truly?

26:53.936 --> 26:57.605
We have the
Madagascar Emerald Peaberry,

26:57.607 --> 26:59.106
in a summer patchouli roast.

26:59.108 --> 27:03.343
It has notes of oak,
cherry, and yoga.

27:03.345 --> 27:08.182
Hmm. You know, I'm looking
for something a bit stronger.

27:08.184 --> 27:09.853
Ah! Let me try that.

27:14.489 --> 27:17.124
Mmm! Morticia, you have
to try these coffee grounds.

27:17.126 --> 27:18.658
They have a wonderful grit!

27:18.660 --> 27:21.028
Just a moment,
what am I hearing?

27:22.431 --> 27:23.863
<i>This is where
we all belong, yeah</i>

27:23.865 --> 27:25.432
<i>Everybody come together</i>

27:25.434 --> 27:28.770
<i>Sing our song, sing our song</i>

27:28.772 --> 27:32.673
<i>Life is really perfect
We are one big family, yeah</i>

27:32.675 --> 27:34.340
<i>Everything is so much better</i>

27:34.342 --> 27:36.446
<i>When I'm like you
and you're like me</i>

27:37.447 --> 27:41.282
<i>What's so great
about being yourself</i>

27:41.284 --> 27:44.151
<i>When you can be
like everyone else?</i>

27:44.153 --> 27:48.488
Wow, that is
absolutely horrible!

27:48.490 --> 27:52.326
<i>It's easy to be happy
when you have no choice</i>

27:52.328 --> 27:55.696
<i>Yes, it's easy to be happy
when you have no choice</i>

27:55.698 --> 27:57.798
Hold on,
unless I miss my guess here,

27:57.800 --> 28:00.701
I believe that is
supposed to be music.

28:00.703 --> 28:01.869
They're greeting us with

28:01.871 --> 28:03.303
one of their
traditional songs.

28:03.305 --> 28:04.870
Well, then,
we ought to do the same.

28:04.872 --> 28:07.140
Wonderful idea, Fester.

28:07.142 --> 28:09.243
<i>Isn't it great
when we are all together?</i>

28:09.245 --> 28:13.180
<i>Say it again
until you believe it</i>

28:13.182 --> 28:15.215
<i>I believe it</i>

28:15.217 --> 28:16.652
<i>We believe it</i>

28:20.823 --> 28:22.555
<i>I'd tip my hat to you</i>

28:22.557 --> 28:24.891
<i>I'd do just that</i>

28:24.893 --> 28:27.395
<i>Take it right off for you,
But I haven't got a hat</i>

28:28.931 --> 28:31.631
<i>I'm just a college boy,
even at that</i>

28:32.768 --> 28:35.502
<i>I'd tip my hat to you
But I haven't got a hat</i>

28:42.444 --> 28:44.276
What? What'd I do?

28:44.278 --> 28:45.579
How rude.

28:45.581 --> 28:47.880
Gomez, we should return home.

28:47.882 --> 28:50.951
Morticia,
this is not the old country.

28:50.953 --> 28:53.454
True, these people
are a little different.

28:53.456 --> 28:55.589
But deep down,
we're all the same.

28:56.758 --> 28:59.126
We have to give them a chance.
Get to know them.

28:59.128 --> 29:00.695
We have to win them over.

29:00.697 --> 29:02.398
"Win them over"?

29:03.131 --> 29:05.067
Well, good morning, neighbor!

29:05.567 --> 29:07.067
Margaux Needler.

29:07.069 --> 29:10.404
Gomez Addams.
At your service.

29:10.406 --> 29:11.772
My wife, Morticia.

29:11.774 --> 29:12.906
Charmed.

29:12.908 --> 29:16.109
Our children,
Wednesday, Pugsley.

29:16.111 --> 29:17.744
And my brother, Fester.

29:17.746 --> 29:18.878
Hey, neighbor!

29:18.880 --> 29:21.080
You know, we can see
right into your windows?

29:21.082 --> 29:24.417
Nice to, uh, meet you.

29:24.419 --> 29:27.119
As your neighbor,
I'd like to offer you

29:27.121 --> 29:29.223
the opportunity of a lifetime.

29:29.225 --> 29:31.492
How'd you like
a free home makeover

29:31.494 --> 29:34.160
from a world-renowned
interior designer?

29:34.162 --> 29:35.494
It will be a challenge,

29:35.496 --> 29:37.965
but I can beautify that
old house of yours so fast,

29:37.967 --> 29:39.199
it'll make your head spin.

29:39.201 --> 29:40.301
I don't wanna brag,

29:40.303 --> 29:41.935
but mine already does that.
Look.

29:44.473 --> 29:47.640
I should like to see what this
plastic woman has to offer.

29:47.642 --> 29:50.644
Yes, well... When is
a good time to stop by?

29:50.646 --> 29:53.446
Actually, Ms. Needler...

29:53.448 --> 29:55.448
Darling...

29:55.450 --> 29:58.285
Stop by anytime you'd like.

29:58.287 --> 30:00.486
Oh, wonderful!
Then it's settled.

30:00.488 --> 30:02.822
I'll see you at your house,
first thing tomorrow.

30:02.824 --> 30:06.426
You're welcome in advance! Ta!

30:08.363 --> 30:10.496
That woman seems deranged.

30:10.498 --> 30:12.631
Her face reminds me
of a death mask.

30:12.633 --> 30:15.002
"Deranged"? "Death mask"?

30:15.004 --> 30:17.204
You tell me
she's got halitosis,

30:17.206 --> 30:18.942
and I'm hearing wedding bells!

30:31.152 --> 30:36.223
Pugsley, this is
the Addams family saber.

30:36.225 --> 30:39.025
300 years of Addams

30:39.027 --> 30:42.130
have danced the Mazurka
with this blade.

30:42.797 --> 30:43.898
Uh-uh.

30:43.900 --> 30:46.500
Only when
you've shown me you're ready.

30:46.502 --> 30:52.039
Your father was the greatest
swordsman in Addams history.

30:52.041 --> 30:55.309
His Mazurka
was the stuff of legends.

30:55.311 --> 30:58.078
So no pressure!

30:58.080 --> 31:01.580
It's all right here,
in the Mazurka handbook.

31:01.582 --> 31:05.051
Every Addams performs
this rite of passage

31:05.053 --> 31:08.421
to show that you're prepared
to defend your family.

31:08.423 --> 31:11.759
It sounds easy,
but believe me, it's insane!

31:11.761 --> 31:12.926
Fester, hand him

31:12.928 --> 31:14.863
the goo-goo-ga-ga
baby training sword.

31:15.663 --> 31:17.531
Pop?

31:17.533 --> 31:20.301
Has anyone
ever failed the Mazurka?

31:20.303 --> 31:22.235
Once.
Your third cousin, Xander.

31:22.237 --> 31:23.436
Never heard of him.

31:23.438 --> 31:24.871
Exactly.

31:24.873 --> 31:25.939
Music!

31:27.376 --> 31:28.841
There's someone at the door.

31:28.843 --> 31:32.446
Hi, guys. I'm going up
to this creepy mansion.

31:32.448 --> 31:35.418
If you don't hear from me
in 30 minutes, send backup.

31:41.823 --> 31:46.062
You rang?

31:51.065 --> 31:52.299
Yeah, no.

31:52.301 --> 31:54.201
Life's too short. See ya!

32:00.743 --> 32:02.074
Oh!

32:02.076 --> 32:04.578
Good morning, Kitty.

32:04.580 --> 32:06.249
Greetings, Ms. Needler.

32:09.451 --> 32:11.217
Wow.

32:11.219 --> 32:14.620
Good morning!
I hope this isn't a bad time.

32:14.622 --> 32:16.622
The worst. Do come in.

32:16.624 --> 32:17.724
Glenn?

32:21.263 --> 32:23.129
Welcome to the neighborhood.

32:23.131 --> 32:24.499
Thank you.

32:26.368 --> 32:28.502
Oh, my! Hmm.

32:28.504 --> 32:30.670
Are you ready
for your Margaux makeover?

32:30.672 --> 32:31.804
Quite.

32:31.806 --> 32:35.274
Pugsley's been climbing
the walls in anticipation.

32:39.415 --> 32:41.017
Well, well, well!

32:42.150 --> 32:43.817
Let's take a look around,
shall we?

32:43.819 --> 32:46.122
And before you say anything,
you're welcome.

32:47.156 --> 32:51.091
Now, if we're trying for
a more contemporary look,

32:51.093 --> 32:53.694
well, these sconces
have to go.

32:56.165 --> 32:58.764
The sconces were a gift
from dead relatives.

32:58.766 --> 32:59.966
If we get rid of them,

32:59.968 --> 33:02.938
they'll be terribly hurt
the next time they visit.

33:04.805 --> 33:07.340
And this is our whine cellar.

33:07.342 --> 33:10.343
We have a lovely
collection of whines.

33:10.345 --> 33:11.878
- <i>Are we there yet?</i>
- <i>I want ice cream!</i>

33:11.880 --> 33:13.680
<i>What do you mean
you're out of avocado toast?</i>

33:13.682 --> 33:16.215
<i>This barrel
makes me look fat.</i>

33:16.217 --> 33:18.217
And here's our bottomless pit.

33:19.955 --> 33:22.188
Uh...
How do we get across?

33:22.190 --> 33:23.358
One moment.

33:36.671 --> 33:39.141
We call this surfing the web.

33:42.977 --> 33:44.580
Well!

33:45.247 --> 33:46.378
I'm scared.

33:46.380 --> 33:47.880
I'm so scared.

33:47.882 --> 33:50.818
Oh, my gosh.

33:50.820 --> 33:52.218
I'm scared
to close my eyes.

33:52.220 --> 33:53.320
I'm scared to open them.

34:13.842 --> 34:17.543
How do all those people fit
in that little contraption?

34:18.679 --> 34:21.782
My vanity mirror only
imprisons 14 souls at a time.

34:23.119 --> 34:24.454
Uh, you don't
have a cell phone?

34:25.188 --> 34:26.686
That's weird.

34:26.688 --> 34:29.121
I may not have a cell phone...

34:29.123 --> 34:31.123
Well, you don't
have a crossbow,

34:31.126 --> 34:32.928
and I thought
everybody had one of those.

34:35.130 --> 34:36.199
Mmm.

34:36.898 --> 34:38.231
My name is Wednesday.

34:38.233 --> 34:39.331
Okay.

34:39.333 --> 34:43.235
Uh, I'm Parker.
How long have you lived here?

34:43.237 --> 34:47.774
My whole life.
Which seems endless.

34:47.775 --> 34:49.608
I've never
seen you at school.

34:49.610 --> 34:50.945
I'm cage-schooled.

34:50.947 --> 34:52.945
- Excuse me?
- It's terribly dull,

34:52.947 --> 34:54.382
but my mother insists.

34:58.320 --> 35:00.754
I'm actually
cutting cage right now.

35:03.657 --> 35:04.925
Uh, okay.

35:04.927 --> 35:06.926
So, what happens
at your school?

35:06.928 --> 35:10.296
Uh, not much, just friends
turning on each other.

35:10.298 --> 35:12.999
Girls making other girls
feel bad about themselves.

35:13.001 --> 35:14.300
Typical junior high stuff.

35:14.302 --> 35:15.303
Intriguing.

35:18.673 --> 35:21.274
Can anyone go to your school?

35:21.276 --> 35:23.776
I guess so. But who'd want to?

35:23.778 --> 35:24.780
Wednesday!

35:25.581 --> 35:26.983
Great shot!

35:43.865 --> 35:47.466
Mr. and Mrs. Addams,
there's really not much to do

35:47.468 --> 35:49.269
to make this place perfect.

35:49.271 --> 35:52.604
All we have to do
is pull down the side walls,

35:52.606 --> 35:55.508
and then also break down
the other two walls.

35:56.678 --> 36:00.847
Open up the ceiling
by breaking it irreversibly.

36:00.849 --> 36:03.649
Just get this nasty little
floor out of the way,

36:03.651 --> 36:07.519
and there you go. With just
those little touches...

36:07.521 --> 36:09.789
Stop! Right there!

36:09.791 --> 36:11.658
Don't touch another thing!

36:11.660 --> 36:15.762
It's perfect.
Ms. Needler, you have a gift.

36:15.764 --> 36:18.631
The good news is I can have
a makeover crew up here

36:18.633 --> 36:20.800
and swinging hammers
first thing in the morning.

36:20.802 --> 36:21.803
What do you say?

36:22.671 --> 36:24.336
We thought you were finished.

36:24.338 --> 36:26.372
Our whole family
is coming in two weeks.

36:26.374 --> 36:27.740
Our finale!

36:27.742 --> 36:30.176
Our finale is in two weeks.

36:30.178 --> 36:31.745
Thank you, Glenn.

36:31.747 --> 36:33.680
It's a gracious offer,
Ms. Needler,

36:33.682 --> 36:35.082
but you really
have done enough.

36:35.084 --> 36:38.187
It's our son's Mazurka.
You understand.

36:38.553 --> 36:39.722
Thank you.

36:44.526 --> 36:45.992
Uh, we're missing Mitch.

36:45.994 --> 36:46.996
Where's Mitch?

36:47.762 --> 36:51.700
<i>Get out!</i>

36:52.767 --> 36:54.734
Mitch who?

36:57.039 --> 36:59.071
Gomez, I'll be blunt.

36:59.073 --> 37:02.242
I have 50 houses
to sell down there,

37:02.244 --> 37:07.713
and their view of your
property is, well, off-brand.

37:07.715 --> 37:10.917
- Fifty houses?
- Yes.

37:10.919 --> 37:12.619
You know,
ever since my family

37:12.621 --> 37:14.653
was chased out
from the old country,

37:14.655 --> 37:18.024
my one dream has been

37:17.059 --> 37:19.725
to find a place
we could call home.

37:19.727 --> 37:22.595
Once they see Assimilation,

37:22.597 --> 37:25.231
I think they'll
want to stay for good.

37:26.535 --> 37:30.403
Thank you so much
for coming by, Membrane.

37:30.405 --> 37:31.738
It's Margaux!

37:31.740 --> 37:34.106
Well then, run, Margaux!

37:34.108 --> 37:36.778
Run, run, run!

37:42.985 --> 37:45.718
That Wednesday girl
is a freak.

37:45.720 --> 37:49.088
We're about to be invaded
by a whole army of freaks.

37:49.090 --> 37:50.990
It's tragic when people
can't accept

37:50.992 --> 37:53.359
the help they so badly need.

37:53.361 --> 37:54.861
And when that happens,

37:54.863 --> 37:58.234
well, another kind of
intervention is called for.

37:59.934 --> 38:01.667
I agree, Gomez.

38:01.669 --> 38:04.504
The whole family moving here
would be a dream come true.

38:04.506 --> 38:06.740
But I don't trust
that Margaux woman.

38:06.742 --> 38:09.778
She's an eccentric, darling,
give her a chance.

38:10.579 --> 38:13.613
"Rasp-berry preserves."

38:13.615 --> 38:14.814
Mmm.

38:14.816 --> 38:17.816
Must be some kind
of scented embalming fluid.

38:19.787 --> 38:22.256
Wednesday,
practice your lurking

38:22.258 --> 38:24.258
on someone
other than your father.

38:24.260 --> 38:25.461
He's too easy.

38:27.595 --> 38:28.829
Much better.

38:28.831 --> 38:31.597
Mother, Father,
I'd like to speak with you.

38:31.599 --> 38:34.200
What's on your mind,
my little nightcrawler?

38:34.202 --> 38:35.936
I spoke with Parker
this afternoon.

38:35.938 --> 38:38.537
She's the daughter
of that talking mannequin

38:38.539 --> 38:39.872
who came by.

38:39.874 --> 38:41.707
She told me about
a communal school

38:41.709 --> 38:43.376
all the neighborhood children
attend.

38:43.378 --> 38:45.979
It's called "junior high."

38:45.981 --> 38:48.682
"Junior high"...

38:48.684 --> 38:51.184
Yes, yes,
I have read about those

38:51.186 --> 38:53.620
in my abnormal
psychology journals.

38:53.622 --> 38:55.521
Anyone of age can enroll.

38:55.523 --> 38:59.626
I think it would be
good for me.

38:59.628 --> 39:01.995
Well, I think
it's a capital idea.

39:01.997 --> 39:03.296
What of your studies here?

39:03.298 --> 39:06.131
Your taxidermy
is coming along so well.

39:06.133 --> 39:08.535
Mother,
would you really deprive me

39:08.537 --> 39:11.838
of the opportunity to torment
children my own age?

39:11.840 --> 39:14.307
Ah, she makes a point.

39:14.309 --> 39:16.341
What's more,
with Wednesday in school,

39:16.343 --> 39:19.014
we'd get to know
the people here even better.

39:19.414 --> 39:21.082
Well, Mother?

39:35.097 --> 39:37.332
Have a good day
at school, dear.

39:39.101 --> 39:40.403
Do your worst!

39:46.207 --> 39:50.412
Ah. Now I understand.
This is a children's prison.

39:53.215 --> 39:54.883
Who's that?

39:55.517 --> 39:57.052
Great.

39:58.352 --> 39:59.454
This is Wednesday.

39:59.787 --> 40:01.921
Hello.

40:01.923 --> 40:03.624
Hey, Parker.

40:05.026 --> 40:07.129
I got something for ya.

40:09.064 --> 40:10.896
A moldy sandwich?

40:10.898 --> 40:12.731
You're slipping, Bethany.

40:12.733 --> 40:14.566
You know what?
You're right.

40:14.568 --> 40:17.305
Let's kick it up a notch.

40:25.113 --> 40:27.381
You have no sense of humor!

40:28.584 --> 40:30.649
- Did you see her face?
- I know.

40:30.651 --> 40:31.653
Bethany, is it?

40:32.921 --> 40:37.256
Don't cut your eyes on my crew
unless you're ready to dance.

40:37.258 --> 40:41.162
What did you say,
little ghoul?

40:41.963 --> 40:44.396
I don't think you understand.

40:44.398 --> 40:47.600
I'm not locked up in here
with you, Bethany.

40:47.602 --> 40:51.803
You're locked up in here
with me.

40:55.642 --> 40:56.811
Whatever.

40:59.079 --> 41:00.613
What did you do?

41:00.615 --> 41:01.981
You shouldn't have said that.

41:01.983 --> 41:05.318
There's nothing you can do.
Bethany's way too popular.

41:05.320 --> 41:07.086
Popularity is fleeting.

41:07.088 --> 41:08.821
I prefer to set my sights

41:08.823 --> 41:11.291
on something
a little more challenging.

41:11.293 --> 41:12.959
Like what?

41:12.961 --> 41:15.264
The establishment.

41:31.345 --> 41:35.615
Let's see.
Who shall I be today?

41:35.617 --> 41:36.849
How about...

41:36.851 --> 41:39.486
Ah, Shelly Longbottom,
on Sugar Ridge Lane.

41:39.488 --> 41:42.457
From Shelly Longbottom
to everyone,

41:43.124 --> 41:45.291
"Did you hear

41:45.293 --> 41:48.695
"about those Addams people?"
Question mark.

41:48.697 --> 41:52.401
"Someone told me
they're wanted in 30 states."

41:55.537 --> 41:58.338
You know they're raising
a garden of man-eating plants?

41:58.340 --> 41:59.838
And feeding them our pets!

41:59.840 --> 42:01.874
Has anyone seen
my Shih Tzu Fee-fee?

42:01.876 --> 42:04.042
They're gonna turn us
all into zombies.

42:04.044 --> 42:05.678
Where are they from anyways?

42:05.680 --> 42:06.812
It doesn't matter!

42:06.814 --> 42:08.481
It's obvious
they don't belong here.

42:08.483 --> 42:11.517
Honey! Oh, those awful people
up on the hill.

42:11.519 --> 42:13.553
They're not even
on Neighborhood Peeps!

42:13.555 --> 42:15.088
Well, that's suspicious.

42:15.090 --> 42:16.988
<i>If other people
are scared, then I'm scared.</i>

42:16.990 --> 42:18.323
<i>I believe
everything I read.</i>

42:18.325 --> 42:19.992
<i>If someone posted it,</i>

42:19.994 --> 42:21.361
<i>it must be true.</i>

42:21.363 --> 42:22.595
<i>You invite
one family in,</i>

42:22.597 --> 42:23.696
<i>then all the families come in.</i>

42:23.698 --> 42:24.865
<i>Do you think
we should investigate?</i>

42:24.867 --> 42:25.932
<i>I'm turning grey.</i>

42:25.934 --> 42:27.566
<i>I'm worried
for the children!</i>

42:27.568 --> 42:29.237
<i>We need
to talk to Margaux!</i>

42:32.372 --> 42:34.407
Open your books. Page 43.

42:34.409 --> 42:36.274
Follow the instructions.

42:36.276 --> 42:38.410
- Yuck.
- Oh.

42:38.412 --> 42:40.546
I've done this
thousands of times.

42:44.887 --> 42:45.888
Huh?

42:56.432 --> 42:57.967
Flip the switch!

43:16.617 --> 43:20.288
Give my creature life!

43:26.628 --> 43:30.064
Live!
Live, I tell you, live!

43:48.316 --> 43:51.352
It's alive! It's alive!

44:09.436 --> 44:11.970
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Get them off me!

44:20.481 --> 44:22.682
Zombie frogs!

44:22.684 --> 44:24.620
Bethany's changed her look.

44:25.019 --> 44:26.184
It suits her.

44:26.186 --> 44:28.720
Awesome. Totally awesome.

44:28.722 --> 44:30.122
It is an honor...

44:30.124 --> 44:31.291
...and a privilege...

44:31.293 --> 44:32.459
...to watch you work.

44:32.461 --> 44:35.062
Hey. Do you wanna
go to the mall?

44:35.064 --> 44:38.898
Why not? I haven't seen
a good mauling in ages.

45:00.153 --> 45:02.921
It's late. I'm worried.

45:02.923 --> 45:05.224
Darling,
Wednesday will be fine.

45:05.226 --> 45:06.725
She can take care of herself.

45:06.727 --> 45:09.028
It's not Wednesday
I'm worried about.

45:09.030 --> 45:12.231
It's the rest of them. We may
need to provide an alibi.

45:12.233 --> 45:14.700
My love, it's game night.

45:14.702 --> 45:15.901
Wednesday will be home soon,

45:15.903 --> 45:18.039
so why don't you
come and join us?

45:18.773 --> 45:21.874
Oh, very well. F-6.

45:21.876 --> 45:24.242
Pugsley,
you heard your mother.

45:24.244 --> 45:26.247
Blow F-6!

45:28.082 --> 45:29.515
Fire in the hole!

45:29.517 --> 45:31.517
I'm king of the world!

45:31.519 --> 45:34.720
<i>Near, far, wherever...</i>

45:42.229 --> 45:43.729
Yes!

45:43.731 --> 45:45.432
You sunk my battleship.

45:45.434 --> 45:47.736
Ha-ha! Well done, Pugsley!

45:56.644 --> 45:58.477
Hello, my uglies!

45:58.479 --> 46:02.148
Mother! I thought
I felt my skin crawling!

46:03.918 --> 46:05.885
Grandma, what a surprise.

46:05.887 --> 46:07.486
I thought you were in Prague.

46:07.488 --> 46:08.921
I was!

46:08.923 --> 46:11.423
They caught me smuggling
crocodiles out of the zoo.

46:11.425 --> 46:13.093
But I escaped
and talked my way

46:13.095 --> 46:14.894
onto a Somali pirate ship.

46:14.896 --> 46:16.495
We got into
a heated poker game

46:16.497 --> 46:18.832
and I cleaned them out.

46:18.834 --> 46:20.666
- Cheating or robbery?
- Both!

46:20.668 --> 46:22.468
Always remember, Pugsley,

46:22.470 --> 46:25.504
it ain't cheating
if no one catches you.

46:25.506 --> 46:27.941
I haven't bathed
in two weeks. Ugh.

46:27.943 --> 46:29.309
Or is it months?

46:29.311 --> 46:31.343
Ha! That reminds me.

46:31.345 --> 46:33.280
Guess what I've got, Pugsley?

46:33.282 --> 46:35.682
- Candy!
- Oh, yes!

46:35.684 --> 46:37.751
But the Mazurka
isn't for a week.

46:37.753 --> 46:39.417
Why are you here so early?

46:39.419 --> 46:42.122
Gomez said you needed
a little help with the party.

46:42.124 --> 46:45.191
And I said, I got my son ready
for his Mazurka,

46:45.193 --> 46:48.794
so of course, I'm going to do
the same for my grandson.

46:48.796 --> 46:50.129
I love him!

46:50.131 --> 46:52.131
It's true! I sent for her!

46:52.133 --> 46:53.899
I can't believe you bothered

46:53.901 --> 46:55.503
your mother with that,
darling.

46:56.003 --> 46:57.169
Neither can I?

46:57.171 --> 46:58.870
He said you were
in over your head.

46:58.872 --> 47:00.039
Thank you, Mother!

47:00.041 --> 47:02.374
Said you were more tense
than he's ever seen you.

47:02.376 --> 47:04.776
- I didn't say that exactly.
- Yes, you did.

47:04.778 --> 47:06.546
You said that exactly.

47:06.548 --> 47:07.680
Said he was worried

47:07.682 --> 47:10.149
you'd have a massive facial
expression and...

47:10.151 --> 47:12.050
You know, I'm starving!
Let's eat!

47:12.052 --> 47:14.854
Not until Wednesday gets home.

47:14.856 --> 47:17.356
Where is that
granddaughter of mine?

47:17.358 --> 47:19.160
I got something for her!

47:20.996 --> 47:23.562
Ah, there's my
little storm cloud!

47:23.564 --> 47:26.064
Wednesday,
where have you been?

47:26.066 --> 47:27.367
Elsewhere.

47:37.512 --> 47:39.211
What are you wearing?

47:39.213 --> 47:41.747
Parker calls it
a pop of color.

47:41.749 --> 47:43.349
While I certainly
appreciate a horse

47:43.351 --> 47:44.517
with a spear
through its head,

47:44.519 --> 47:45.584
the color is...

47:45.586 --> 47:47.586
She claims
it brings out my smile.

47:47.588 --> 47:49.988
Wednesday,
you don't have a smile.

47:49.990 --> 47:51.524
Turns out
I have a lot of things

47:51.526 --> 47:52.828
you don't know about.

47:56.865 --> 47:58.898
I see I got here just in time.

47:58.900 --> 48:00.633
You were right to call, Gomez.

48:00.635 --> 48:02.869
I'll talk to her.
Hand me that bear trap.

48:02.871 --> 48:06.275
Thank you, Grandma.
But I will handle this.

48:06.874 --> 48:08.276
Ah, suit yourself.

48:11.378 --> 48:14.814
When you're done with Fabio,
send him up to my room.

48:14.816 --> 48:17.052
- Ooh-hoo-hoo.
- Oh, boy!

48:19.688 --> 48:21.419
Wednesday.

48:21.421 --> 48:23.756
How would you like
to join me tomorrow

48:23.758 --> 48:28.294
after the school for tea
and séance in the cemetery?

48:28.296 --> 48:30.028
Is attendance mandatory?

48:30.030 --> 48:31.731
Come now, my little raven.

48:31.733 --> 48:34.200
You did so love it
when you were younger.

48:34.202 --> 48:35.570
If you like, Mother.

48:37.738 --> 48:39.439
Sleep well, dear.

48:39.441 --> 48:41.977
Don't forget to kick
your father good night.

48:47.314 --> 48:48.747
What's your
favorite filter?

48:48.749 --> 48:52.051
I don't know. I look black
and white in all of them.

48:52.053 --> 48:53.385
You know,
when I met you,

48:53.387 --> 48:55.120
I thought you were
super weird.

48:55.122 --> 48:56.921
But now,
I think you're really cool.

48:56.923 --> 48:58.157
I concur.

48:58.159 --> 49:00.325
You're not completely devoid
of merit yourself.

49:00.327 --> 49:02.430
I wanna say "thank you"...

49:04.898 --> 49:05.965
Oh, how'd that barrette

49:05.967 --> 49:07.399
you bought yesterday
go over at home?

49:07.401 --> 49:11.671
Actually, my mother's reaction
was, well, unexpected.

49:11.673 --> 49:15.307
She was accepting.
It depressed me.

49:15.309 --> 49:18.611
One never wants to see
one's mother that way.

49:18.613 --> 49:19.812
But I must admit,

49:19.814 --> 49:24.682
walking around in something
so garish, so grotesque...

49:24.684 --> 49:26.785
I was shocked
how thrilling it felt.

49:26.787 --> 49:29.354
I wish
I could do that.

49:29.356 --> 49:31.090
But my mom makes me
wear this stuff,

49:31.092 --> 49:33.093
and it's just so...

49:33.095 --> 49:37.296
I believe the word you're
looking for is "unfortunate."

49:37.298 --> 49:40.700
Ugh. I'd love to
just go crazy

49:40.702 --> 49:43.271
and wear something
that would shock her.

49:44.439 --> 49:45.671
Well, Parker,

49:45.673 --> 49:46.838
you're in luck.

49:46.840 --> 49:50.211
You happen to be talking
to the queen of shock.

50:11.298 --> 50:12.463
Hello, Mother.

50:12.465 --> 50:14.633
<i>Where's my little wraith?</i>

50:14.635 --> 50:16.568
Wednesday
still hasn't arrived.

50:16.570 --> 50:19.204
We agreed to come up here
for tea and séance,

50:19.206 --> 50:21.840
and now it seems
she stood me up.

50:21.842 --> 50:23.575
<i>Morticia!
Can you hear me?</i>

50:23.577 --> 50:24.977
<i>You're not doing it right.</i>

50:24.979 --> 50:26.312
- <i>Press that button there.</i>
- <i>I did! I did!</i>

50:26.314 --> 50:27.379
<i>Did you hear it click?</i>

50:27.381 --> 50:28.479
<i>Morticia!</i>

50:28.481 --> 50:29.615
<i>It's supposed to be on</i>

50:29.617 --> 50:31.017
- <i>when you hear the click.</i>
- <i>Wait, I see something.</i>

50:31.019 --> 50:32.718
- <i>You did it!</i>
- <i>Hello, darling!</i>

50:32.720 --> 50:34.486
<i>Now, where's my granddaughter?</i>

50:34.488 --> 50:35.921
Just what I said.

50:35.923 --> 50:38.057
I think she's distancing
herself from me.

50:38.059 --> 50:39.691
<i>Oh,
she's wrapped in a black hole</i>

50:39.693 --> 50:40.992
<i>of emptiness and longing,</i>

50:40.994 --> 50:42.528
<i>like all of us Frump women.</i>

50:42.530 --> 50:44.963
- <i>Wednesday?
- It's not Wednesday!</i>

50:44.965 --> 50:46.999
- <i>Who's this?</i>
- It's me, Father.

50:47.001 --> 50:48.066
<i>Morticia?</i>

50:48.068 --> 50:50.436
<i>What's wrong with you now?</i>

50:50.438 --> 50:52.537
The world can be so cruel.

50:52.539 --> 50:55.173
And all she wants to do
is run toward it.

50:55.175 --> 50:57.041
<i>She's a lot like you that way.</i>

50:57.043 --> 50:58.510
<i>You wanted to see the world.</i>

50:58.512 --> 51:00.680
<i>Find yourself.
Serve time!</i>

51:00.682 --> 51:03.615
<i>Listen,
Morticia, remember the time</i>

51:03.617 --> 51:06.619
<i>you ran away
and joined the Girl Scouts?</i>

51:06.621 --> 51:10.189
<i>We were so worried
you were on a bad path.</i>

51:10.191 --> 51:12.624
<i>But when you found out
that campfires</i>

51:12.626 --> 51:15.928
<i>were for roasting marshmallows
and not other Girl Scouts,</i>

51:15.930 --> 51:17.930
<i>well, you got bored
and you came home.</i>

51:17.932 --> 51:20.233
<i>We were so relieved.</i>

51:20.235 --> 51:21.700
<i>Trust Wednesday.</i>

51:21.702 --> 51:24.803
<i>Like you,
she'll do the right thing.</i>

51:24.805 --> 51:28.374
Thank you, Father.
That's most comforting.

51:28.376 --> 51:30.408
<i>Good.
Wait a second.</i>

51:30.410 --> 51:31.642
<i>When did I die?</i>

51:31.644 --> 51:33.146
<i>20 years ago.</i>

51:33.148 --> 51:35.914
<i>Oh, right.
Happy anniversary, darling.</i>

51:35.916 --> 51:39.551
All right, Pugsley, let's,
uh, go through it again.

51:39.553 --> 51:42.655
You got this, Pugsley.
This Mazurka's nothing.

51:44.492 --> 51:47.425
You eat swords for breakfast.

51:47.427 --> 51:50.095
You just got a case
of pre-ball jitters.

51:50.097 --> 51:52.263
It's way more common
than you think.

51:52.265 --> 51:54.834
If a Mazurka lasts
for more than four hours,

51:54.836 --> 51:56.438
contact your doctor.

51:57.805 --> 51:59.841
From the top.
Music!

52:14.655 --> 52:15.820
Pugsley,

52:15.822 --> 52:17.455
I can honestly say

52:17.457 --> 52:21.593
that was most definitely
a thing you did.

52:21.595 --> 52:24.863
A question,
what in heaven's name was it?

52:24.865 --> 52:26.265
The Sabre Mazurka.

52:28.702 --> 52:31.104
You know what?
You've been practicing hard.

52:31.106 --> 52:33.205
Why don't we
call it a day? Hmm?

52:33.207 --> 52:35.207
Hit the showers, kid.

52:35.209 --> 52:36.575
So, we're finished?

52:36.577 --> 52:37.843
Ah, yes.

52:37.845 --> 52:41.613
Yes, son. We are
most certainly finished.

52:41.615 --> 52:43.582
Mmm. Okay. Thanks, Pop.

52:43.584 --> 52:45.020
Thanks, Uncle Fester.

52:49.657 --> 52:53.693
This is a complete disaster!
How did this happen?

52:53.695 --> 52:55.193
And he's going
to make a fool of himself

52:55.195 --> 52:56.495
in front of everyone!

52:56.497 --> 52:58.530
Gomez, you gotta calm down!

52:58.532 --> 53:00.800
There's still a day
to get him ready!

53:00.802 --> 53:04.437
Fester, a year wouldn't be
enough to get him ready.

53:04.439 --> 53:06.506
I've failed him, Fester.

53:06.508 --> 53:11.142
I tried to raise him to be
an Addams, but I failed.

53:11.144 --> 53:13.914
They're going
to eat him alive.

53:15.916 --> 53:18.983
<i>I like it like that
Ooh, baby</i>

53:18.985 --> 53:21.019
<i>I said I like it like that</i>

53:21.021 --> 53:25.124
<i>Ooh, baby,
I like it like that</i>

53:25.126 --> 53:27.359
All right. Thank you.

53:27.361 --> 53:29.762
Grandma,
we already have a band.

53:29.764 --> 53:32.164
They came highly recommended
from the mortuary.

53:32.166 --> 53:33.465
Oh.

53:33.467 --> 53:35.501
I'm sure
they're good.

53:35.503 --> 53:38.370
My sister Sloom is
going to be judging Pugsley.

53:38.372 --> 53:40.273
And if things aren't done
the traditional way,

53:40.275 --> 53:41.840
she won't be happy,

53:41.842 --> 53:44.109
and the Mazurka
could be a disaster!

53:44.111 --> 53:46.113
But what do I know?

53:46.414 --> 53:47.546
Fine.

53:47.548 --> 53:48.948
Yay, we got the gig!

53:48.950 --> 53:50.048
We got it!

53:50.050 --> 53:51.550
Ah, one more thing...

53:51.552 --> 53:54.919
Oh, someone's at the door.
I'd better go see who it is.

54:01.896 --> 54:05.597
<i>What's so great
about being yourself</i>

54:05.599 --> 54:09.734
<i>When you can be like
everyone else?</i>

54:09.736 --> 54:12.271
Do not speak
to your mother that way.

54:12.273 --> 54:14.805
How dare you
enter this house like that.

54:14.807 --> 54:16.945
Wait, where are your tattoos?

54:19.380 --> 54:20.812
Oh, thank the stars!

54:20.814 --> 54:23.381
- Where were you?
- Hanging out with Parker.

54:23.383 --> 54:26.151
Is this why you skipped
tea and séance?

54:26.153 --> 54:28.153
Your grandparents
were trying to contact you.

54:28.155 --> 54:29.454
Holy Hades!

54:29.456 --> 54:31.057
Whoever did that to you,
Wednesday,

54:31.059 --> 54:33.425
I hope the other guy
looks worse.

54:33.427 --> 54:36.361
Nobody did this to me.
This is my new look.

54:36.363 --> 54:37.629
Do you like it?

54:37.631 --> 54:38.731
I do not like it.

54:38.733 --> 54:40.932
Everyone knows pink
is a gateway color.

54:40.934 --> 54:43.769
I warned you about sending her
to public school.

54:43.771 --> 54:44.836
Don't worry.

54:44.838 --> 54:46.570
Wednesday is never
going to that school again.

54:46.572 --> 54:47.905
- What?
- In fact,

54:47.907 --> 54:50.311
she's never leaving
this house again.

54:53.447 --> 54:56.515
Wow, that's some evil eye
she's got there.

54:56.517 --> 54:59.651
No, that dead-eye stare
is new.

54:59.653 --> 55:01.854
And I think I know
where she got it.

55:01.856 --> 55:04.590
Hey, guys, this is me now.

55:04.592 --> 55:07.593
If you like it, hit "like,"
but who cares if you like it.

55:07.595 --> 55:09.028
I'm living my truth.

55:09.030 --> 55:10.798
Parker?

55:12.298 --> 55:14.369
- Who did this to you?
- I did.

55:15.102 --> 55:17.102
This is my new look, Mother.

55:17.104 --> 55:21.673
I decided that from now on,
I choose my clothes, not you.

55:21.675 --> 55:25.077
Argh! This is that little
creep Wednesday Addams' work!

55:25.079 --> 55:28.347
She's not a creep.
She's just not like you.

55:28.349 --> 55:30.216
Why can't you ever let
people be different?

55:30.218 --> 55:34.486
Because it's my calling
to make everyone the same.

55:34.488 --> 55:38.390
Too bright!
It burns!

55:38.392 --> 55:41.292
Good! Maybe it'll burn away
the weird!

55:41.294 --> 55:42.494
I hate it here!

55:42.496 --> 55:44.495
Everything's boring
and fake and bright,

55:44.497 --> 55:46.231
like plastic flowers!

55:46.233 --> 55:47.466
Like you!

55:47.468 --> 55:51.504
Parker!
Plastic flowers live forever.

55:51.506 --> 55:53.808
Now, you go think
about that in your room.

55:54.407 --> 55:56.508
With no social media.

55:56.510 --> 55:58.977
No! Please, no.
Anything but that!

55:58.979 --> 56:01.646
Now go wipe that depressing
goop off your face.

56:01.648 --> 56:03.414
You first!

56:03.416 --> 56:07.553
Oh! Those Addamses
have gone too far this time.

56:07.555 --> 56:10.592
I think they're going to need
a little more help.

56:26.374 --> 56:27.542
Hey!

56:29.510 --> 56:31.376
Where are you going?

56:31.378 --> 56:32.945
A friend's.

56:32.947 --> 56:37.249
I hold people prisoner,
not the other way around.

56:37.251 --> 56:39.350
Good luck with your Mazurka.

56:39.352 --> 56:41.754
Wait, you're leaving?

56:41.756 --> 56:43.555
Who's gonna torment me
every day?

56:43.557 --> 56:46.758
Living under this roof is
all the torment you'll need.

56:46.760 --> 56:49.026
Besides, our parents
have made it clear

56:49.028 --> 56:51.796
that the only way
to be accepted in this family

56:51.798 --> 56:54.733
is to be exactly like them.

56:54.735 --> 56:57.102
I can't play
by those rules anymore.

56:57.104 --> 56:59.637
Farewell, brother Pugsley.

56:59.639 --> 57:01.542
Tomorrow, you become a man.

57:02.075 --> 57:04.311
And I become a fugitive.

57:05.979 --> 57:08.713
Always kinda knew
it'd end up like this.

57:08.715 --> 57:11.249
Just didn't think
it'd be so soon.

57:11.251 --> 57:13.718
I'll never
forget you, Pugsley!

57:13.720 --> 57:15.553
But I'll try.

57:15.555 --> 57:18.657
Pugsley, have you seen
your sister?

57:18.659 --> 57:20.258
She's not in her room.

57:20.260 --> 57:21.827
Mmm...

57:21.829 --> 57:24.164
Pugsley. Where's Wednesday?

57:24.731 --> 57:26.099
Um... Tsk.

57:27.834 --> 57:32.236
Tick, tock,
tick, tock, Mother.

57:32.238 --> 57:35.006
You're getting very sleepy.

57:35.008 --> 57:36.240
Pugsley...

57:36.242 --> 57:39.979
She did not go
to her friend's house.

57:39.981 --> 57:41.814
She went to
her friend's house?

57:41.816 --> 57:45.684
I repeat, she did not
go to her friend's...

58:12.046 --> 58:15.617
<i>When the day is long</i>

58:17.285 --> 58:19.220
<i>And the night</i>

58:19.887 --> 58:22.323
<i>The night is yours alone</i>

58:27.561 --> 58:28.959
<i>When you're sure</i>

58:28.961 --> 58:31.532
<i>You've had enough</i>

58:33.066 --> 58:35.235
<i>Of this life</i>

58:37.070 --> 58:39.140
<i>Hang on</i>

58:42.809 --> 58:46.514
<i>Don't let yourself go</i>

58:50.418 --> 58:54.088
<i>'Cause everybody cries</i>

58:58.191 --> 59:03.160
<i>And everybody hurts</i>

59:04.564 --> 59:06.532
<i>Sometimes</i>

59:06.534 --> 59:09.202
I shall be staying with you
for a while.

59:10.104 --> 59:13.942
<i>Everybody hurts</i>

59:18.111 --> 59:19.343
<i>If this doesn't work,</i>

59:19.345 --> 59:21.379
<i>the next house we flip
is gonna land on you.</i>

59:21.381 --> 59:22.580
Marty, listen to me.

59:22.582 --> 59:25.184
Tomorrow, our finale
will be the biggest half hour

59:25.186 --> 59:26.919
your network has ever aired.

59:26.921 --> 59:29.088
There's just one more thing
to take care of.

59:29.090 --> 59:30.555
<i>This better be good
or you won't be able</i>

59:30.557 --> 59:31.791
<i>to get a job as a doormat.</i>

59:31.793 --> 59:32.925
Yes, yes, yes.

59:32.927 --> 59:36.396
I intend to bring
the house down.

59:50.311 --> 59:51.977
<i>When the pimp's in the crib ma</i>

59:51.979 --> 59:54.546
<i>Drop it like it's hot
Drop it like it's hot</i>

59:54.548 --> 59:55.814
<i>Drop it like it's hot</i>

59:55.816 --> 59:57.283
<i>When the pigs try
to get at you</i>

59:57.285 --> 59:59.783
<i>Park it like it's hot
Park it like it's hot</i>

59:59.785 --> 01:00:00.952
<i>Park it like it's hot</i>

01:00:00.954 --> 01:00:02.421
<i>And if a... get a attitude</i>

01:00:02.423 --> 01:00:04.756
<i>Pop it like it's hot
Pop it like it's hot</i>

01:00:04.758 --> 01:00:05.890
<i>Pop it like it's hot</i>

01:00:05.892 --> 01:00:08.561
<i>I got the Rolly on my arm
and I'm pouring Chandon</i>

01:00:08.563 --> 01:00:11.633
<i>And I roll the best...
'cause I got it going on</i>

01:00:16.803 --> 01:00:20.738
You rang?

01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:23.207
It. Cousin. You made it!

01:00:24.343 --> 01:00:26.812
Please, come in.
Make yourself at home.

01:00:29.416 --> 01:00:30.950
Where did she hide my phone?

01:00:30.952 --> 01:00:32.450
I haven't been able

01:00:32.452 --> 01:00:34.820
to post a photo of my lunch
in almost three days!

01:00:34.822 --> 01:00:37.321
And what about in there?

01:00:37.323 --> 01:00:39.358
That's my mom's crafting room.

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:41.660
No one is allowed in there.

01:00:41.662 --> 01:00:43.031
Then that's where it is.

01:00:50.671 --> 01:00:52.040
Weird.

01:01:05.052 --> 01:01:06.218
Whoa.

01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:07.885
Hidden depths.

01:01:07.887 --> 01:01:09.821
What is this?

01:01:09.823 --> 01:01:12.791
There's Mr. Haney
making a sandwich.

01:01:12.793 --> 01:01:15.526
And that guy trying to put
a tiny tuxedo on his cat.

01:01:15.528 --> 01:01:16.794
- <i>Sit still!</i>
- That's Mr. Flynn.

01:01:16.796 --> 01:01:17.863
<i>Why are you
being so difficult?</i>

01:01:17.865 --> 01:01:18.930
<i>Trying to make you</i>

01:01:18.932 --> 01:01:20.532
- <i>look handsome.</i>
- My money's on the cat.

01:01:20.534 --> 01:01:23.234
And there's our science
teacher, Ms. Gravely,

01:01:23.236 --> 01:01:26.238
putting her underwear
in the freezer?

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:29.573
My mom must have built
hidden cameras

01:01:29.575 --> 01:01:31.475
into all of the houses.

01:01:31.477 --> 01:01:32.878
She really is psycho.

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.015
- Parker!
- Whoa!

01:01:35.381 --> 01:01:37.247
Hey, Mom.

01:01:37.249 --> 01:01:39.651
We were just looking for you.

01:01:39.653 --> 01:01:43.724
What have I told you
about Mommy's crafting room?

01:01:45.425 --> 01:01:48.526
Sorry to do this,
but standards must be upheld.

01:01:48.528 --> 01:01:51.032
Parker, someday you'll
understand, and, Wednesday...

01:01:51.564 --> 01:01:52.833
Well, anyway, Parker.

01:01:56.570 --> 01:01:59.838
My mom
has a lair and a jail?

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:02.173
I knew I should have picked
to live with my dad.

01:02:02.175 --> 01:02:04.541
We're gonna be on TV!

01:02:04.543 --> 01:02:05.711
Are we gonna be famous?

01:02:05.713 --> 01:02:07.079
Glenn, what do you
want in the frame?

01:02:07.081 --> 01:02:09.280
Okay, everyone, listen up.

01:02:09.282 --> 01:02:11.216
It's the last run-through
before the finale,

01:02:11.218 --> 01:02:13.419
so let's try this
one last time, okay?

01:02:13.421 --> 01:02:16.155
We're gonna shoot across
the town square to the gazebo

01:02:16.157 --> 01:02:17.888
where Margaux
will make her grand entrance.

01:02:17.890 --> 01:02:20.392
So everyone will be
walking this direction

01:02:20.394 --> 01:02:21.892
across the square.

01:02:21.894 --> 01:02:23.695
Judy, you start here,

01:02:23.697 --> 01:02:25.463
Ken, you're gonna follow Judy.

01:02:25.465 --> 01:02:28.133
You can stand right here
and...

01:02:28.135 --> 01:02:30.537
Uh, is there
a bathroom nearby?

01:02:31.037 --> 01:02:32.572
Uh...

01:02:35.742 --> 01:02:37.642
Margaux, they're here!

01:02:37.644 --> 01:02:39.245
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

01:02:39.247 --> 01:02:40.711
They're here!

01:02:40.713 --> 01:02:42.948
The Addams family!

01:02:53.126 --> 01:02:54.292
Pardon me.

01:02:55.930 --> 01:02:56.998
Excuse me.

01:02:57.664 --> 01:02:58.829
What are we gonna do?

01:02:58.831 --> 01:03:03.936
What we always do, Glenn.
Help people.

01:03:03.938 --> 01:03:07.104
"The Addams monsters
are planning

01:03:07.106 --> 01:03:10.975
"to attack the town tonight!"
Exclamation point.

01:03:12.146 --> 01:03:14.816
<i>"Meet at Margaux's house now."</i>

01:03:15.282 --> 01:03:16.984
Mmm? Oh.

01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:25.291
Salutations, Addams.
We're here!

01:03:25.293 --> 01:03:28.325
Petunia, I love what
you've done with your hair.

01:03:28.327 --> 01:03:31.028
Thanks, I just had it mowed.

01:03:31.030 --> 01:03:33.497
Please, come in.
Make yourself uncomfortable.

01:03:33.499 --> 01:03:35.800
Uncle Onion!

01:03:35.802 --> 01:03:37.202
- It's been so long!
- <i>Voilà!</i>

01:03:37.204 --> 01:03:39.437
Yes, so disappointed
to see you.

01:03:39.439 --> 01:03:42.807
Ah, you always manage
to bring a tear to my eye!

01:03:43.943 --> 01:03:46.678
Greetings, Dr. Flambe!
How you doing?

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:48.814
- I'm on fire!
- Good!

01:03:48.816 --> 01:03:50.582
This party's gonna be lit!

01:03:50.584 --> 01:03:52.520
Ah, Auntie Sloom.

01:03:53.153 --> 01:03:55.452
Auntie Sloom!

01:03:55.454 --> 01:04:00.191
You are as radiant
as a barrel of nuclear waste.

01:04:00.193 --> 01:04:03.163
Where is the boy?

01:04:03.497 --> 01:04:04.562
Pugsley?

01:04:04.564 --> 01:04:06.530
Ah, there you are.

01:04:06.532 --> 01:04:07.832
Come down and say hello

01:04:07.834 --> 01:04:09.202
- to your Auntie Sloom.
- Ahh!

01:04:11.805 --> 01:04:16.508
Gomez, this tradition is not
to be taken lightly.

01:04:16.510 --> 01:04:19.676
I trust that the boy
has been properly trained.

01:04:19.678 --> 01:04:21.245
Yes, once you see how we've...

01:04:21.247 --> 01:04:25.883
It's bad enough this Mazurka
is taking place in New Jersey.

01:04:25.885 --> 01:04:29.021
Now, where are the dregs?
I'm thirsty.

01:04:29.023 --> 01:04:31.023
<i>You've seen them!</i>

01:04:31.025 --> 01:04:34.325
<i>You've heard the stories
on Neighborhood Peeps!</i>

01:04:34.327 --> 01:04:38.729
<i>Those Addams aren't people,
they're monsters!</i>

01:04:38.731 --> 01:04:41.901
<i>And now, there's
an infestation of them!</i>

01:04:41.903 --> 01:04:45.236
<i>They're here to destroy
our beautiful community</i>

01:04:45.238 --> 01:04:46.437
<i>and turn it into a place</i>

01:04:46.439 --> 01:04:48.907
<i>that no</i> Design Intervention
<i>can save!</i>

01:04:48.909 --> 01:04:51.410
Addams aren't wanted here!

01:04:51.412 --> 01:04:53.245
They're monsters!
They're all monsters!

01:04:53.247 --> 01:04:56.347
<i>We need to destroy them first!</i>

01:04:56.349 --> 01:04:58.251
<i>Who's with me?</i>

01:04:59.119 --> 01:05:00.584
<i>We'll be revealing
Assimilation</i>

01:05:00.586 --> 01:05:02.787
<i>and all of you to our audience
in just an hour.</i>

01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:06.224
<i>Our last chance to help
these people is now.</i>

01:05:06.226 --> 01:05:09.727
Bill, John, do you still have
that lovely catapult?

01:05:09.729 --> 01:05:11.195
Yes, we do!

01:05:11.197 --> 01:05:13.198
Are you sure about this?

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.066
We can't let them ruin
our neighborhood!

01:05:15.068 --> 01:05:16.133
Let's do it!

01:05:16.135 --> 01:05:17.537
I want them out!

01:05:19.305 --> 01:05:22.506
No one torments
my family but me.

01:05:22.508 --> 01:05:23.811
Hair clip, please.

01:05:24.711 --> 01:05:25.947
Okay.

01:05:34.755 --> 01:05:37.590
Cage school 101.

01:05:39.093 --> 01:05:40.158
He'd better be ready

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:41.559
or Auntie Sloom
will have his head!

01:05:41.561 --> 01:05:42.961
He looks very small.

01:05:42.963 --> 01:05:44.662
That kid's
got some big shoes to fill.

01:05:44.664 --> 01:05:46.465
I certainly
hope the boy's ready.

01:05:46.467 --> 01:05:48.999
Well, I'm not going
easy on him.

01:05:59.012 --> 01:06:00.111
Heads up.

01:06:01.648 --> 01:06:03.314
Hey, alto, you're flat.

01:06:09.155 --> 01:06:10.488
Sloom.

01:06:10.490 --> 01:06:12.925
- Sister.
- Darling, I...

01:06:12.927 --> 01:06:14.693
I know the last time
we saw each other,

01:06:14.695 --> 01:06:16.193
we had that horrible fight.

01:06:16.195 --> 01:06:19.564
And I just wanted to tell you,
from the bottom of my heart,

01:06:19.566 --> 01:06:22.466
I won that fight!
And I was glad I cheated!

01:06:22.468 --> 01:06:26.504
You won?
Still a sore loser, as always!

01:06:26.506 --> 01:06:29.274
I want a rematch!
Right here! Right now!

01:06:29.276 --> 01:06:31.809
Auntie Sloom?
Can I get you anything?

01:06:31.811 --> 01:06:33.178
When's the Mazurka?

01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:34.780
Soon, soon.

01:06:34.782 --> 01:06:36.615
Our daughter Wednesday
isn't here yet.

01:06:36.617 --> 01:06:39.383
If your daughter
can't be on time,

01:06:39.385 --> 01:06:41.688
then we will begin
without her!

01:06:42.322 --> 01:06:44.955
Very well, Auntie Sloom.

01:06:48.361 --> 01:06:51.798
Attention, please. Attention!

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:57.135
The hour is upon us.

01:06:57.137 --> 01:06:58.238
Places!

01:07:11.985 --> 01:07:17.756
We gather today to witness
my son, Pugsley Addams,

01:07:17.758 --> 01:07:20.561
perform his Sabre Mazurka.

01:07:43.249 --> 01:07:46.852
He will begin with a reading
from the Terror,

01:07:46.854 --> 01:07:50.624
which commemorates
our cries in battle.

01:08:12.579 --> 01:08:16.483
And now,
the transition into manhood.

01:08:34.267 --> 01:08:37.100
<i>And now, the Sabre Mazurka.</i>

01:08:45.144 --> 01:08:46.446
Hold still.

01:08:48.482 --> 01:08:50.849
The Addams mustache.

01:08:50.850 --> 01:08:52.452
Now you're ready.

01:10:02.856 --> 01:10:03.924
Pugsley?

01:10:06.593 --> 01:10:08.193
I give up.

01:10:08.195 --> 01:10:10.030
I can't do it, Pop.

01:10:11.564 --> 01:10:12.765
Oh.

01:10:15.402 --> 01:10:16.570
I'm sorry.

01:10:17.504 --> 01:10:19.537
I let you down.

01:10:19.539 --> 01:10:22.509
You haven't
let me down, Pugsley.

01:10:23.744 --> 01:10:25.510
I let you down.

01:10:25.512 --> 01:10:27.212
I was so focused
on doing things

01:10:27.214 --> 01:10:29.012
the traditional way,

01:10:29.014 --> 01:10:31.151
I forgot to let you
be who you are.

01:10:35.588 --> 01:10:36.654
<i>Hey!</i>

01:10:36.656 --> 01:10:40.559
<i>Are ya ready
for your Margaux makeover now?</i>

01:10:40.561 --> 01:10:41.860
It's Margaux.

01:10:41.862 --> 01:10:43.227
She must have turned
the whole town

01:10:43.229 --> 01:10:44.863
into stark raving lunatics.

01:10:44.865 --> 01:10:47.265
Well, I have to admit,
I admire her work.

01:10:47.267 --> 01:10:48.400
Let's do this thing!

01:10:48.402 --> 01:10:50.235
It's locked and loaded,
Margaux.

01:10:50.237 --> 01:10:52.640
Let's go get 'em!
We've had enough!

01:10:53.205 --> 01:10:54.207
Fire!

01:10:59.144 --> 01:11:02.982
<i>Get out!</i>

01:11:09.455 --> 01:11:10.888
Pugsley!

01:11:10.890 --> 01:11:13.958
What is the true meaning
of the Mazurka?

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:16.461
It's about protecting
our family

01:11:16.463 --> 01:11:18.663
from those who would
do us harm!

01:11:18.665 --> 01:11:22.069
Go ahead.
Show 'em what you're good at.

01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:30.809
<i>All we have to do
is pull down the side walls!</i>

01:11:30.811 --> 01:11:32.842
<i>You shouldn't mess with me</i>

01:11:32.844 --> 01:11:35.079
<i>You don't wanna mess with me</i>

01:11:35.081 --> 01:11:38.852
<i>'Cause if you mess with me
You're messing with my family</i>

01:11:42.022 --> 01:11:44.890
Everyone, follow my boy!

01:11:49.963 --> 01:11:51.130
Hey, guys!

01:12:08.147 --> 01:12:11.818
<i>You might think
that we are all loco</i>

01:12:16.322 --> 01:12:20.160
<i>But this family
is about to go global</i>

01:12:26.165 --> 01:12:27.633
<i>Fire!</i>

01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:32.305
Shakalaka bang, baby!

01:12:39.412 --> 01:12:41.245
Quick! Out this way!

01:12:45.885 --> 01:12:47.720
Pop, I'm out of ammo!

01:12:49.388 --> 01:12:50.989
We're trapped!

01:13:13.213 --> 01:13:15.012
Hope I'm not crashing
the party.

01:13:15.014 --> 01:13:16.114
Wednesday!

01:13:16.116 --> 01:13:17.414
Yeah!

01:13:17.416 --> 01:13:19.285
Ichabod, quick,
lower your branches!

01:13:22.054 --> 01:13:23.723
Everyone, grab on!

01:13:46.946 --> 01:13:52.016
Margaux Needler never stops
until the project is complete.

01:13:55.488 --> 01:13:56.823
Fire in the hole!

01:13:58.590 --> 01:14:00.091
Mazurka!

01:14:03.495 --> 01:14:04.928
Is everyone all right?

01:14:04.930 --> 01:14:07.601
No limbs missing that weren't
missing before you arrived?

01:14:13.673 --> 01:14:17.842
My little raven,
I'm so happy you returned.

01:14:17.844 --> 01:14:19.443
Of course I came back.

01:14:19.445 --> 01:14:20.511
I knew there was no way

01:14:20.513 --> 01:14:22.012
you were going
to save yourselves.

01:14:22.014 --> 01:14:24.449
You are like
weak baby squirrels.

01:14:37.531 --> 01:14:38.631
Socrates.

01:14:40.832 --> 01:14:43.437
Eight legs, nine lives.

01:14:45.804 --> 01:14:47.974
You were right,
<i>cara mia.</i>

01:14:48.842 --> 01:14:50.443
People can be cruel.

01:14:51.376 --> 01:14:52.776
What have we done?

01:14:52.778 --> 01:14:55.312
They're just a family.

01:14:55.314 --> 01:14:56.480
A family?

01:14:56.482 --> 01:14:58.615
Oh, please!
They're a bunch of monsters!

01:14:58.617 --> 01:15:01.052
Don't go soft on me, people.

01:15:01.054 --> 01:15:03.320
I will relish hounding you

01:15:03.322 --> 01:15:05.556
until that nuclear waste dump
of a house is gone

01:15:05.558 --> 01:15:08.391
and your mutant family
along with it! Ah!

01:15:08.393 --> 01:15:11.462
Be careful what you wish for,
Ms. Needler.

01:15:11.464 --> 01:15:15.369
My family and I will never run
from the likes of you again.

01:15:21.006 --> 01:15:22.974
Deep breath, Margaux.

01:15:22.976 --> 01:15:24.708
Okay, I have a finale
to shoot.

01:15:24.710 --> 01:15:26.343
Parker, let's go.

01:15:26.345 --> 01:15:28.578
I'm not going
anywhere with you.

01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:29.881
I'm staying with my friend.

01:15:29.883 --> 01:15:31.248
Your friend?

01:15:31.250 --> 01:15:33.184
Parker, these people
are freaks.

01:15:33.186 --> 01:15:35.185
If they're freaks,
then I'm a freak.

01:15:35.187 --> 01:15:37.221
And so are all of you.

01:15:37.223 --> 01:15:38.355
Exhibit A.

01:15:38.357 --> 01:15:42.092
Ms. Gravely, you put
your underwear in the freezer.

01:15:42.094 --> 01:15:44.095
Hey, it's refreshing, okay?

01:15:44.097 --> 01:15:46.263
Exhibit B.
Trudy Pickering.

01:15:46.265 --> 01:15:48.533
You sit on
the toilet backwards.

01:15:48.535 --> 01:15:51.101
Well, where else am I supposed
to put my arms?

01:15:51.103 --> 01:15:53.104
Wait, how did you know that?

01:15:53.106 --> 01:15:57.108
Because your houses have been
infested with Needler-Vision.

01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:59.843
She has hidden cameras
everywhere.

01:15:59.845 --> 01:16:00.912
What?

01:16:00.914 --> 01:16:03.580
And watches you
all of the time.

01:16:03.582 --> 01:16:04.681
In my private time?

01:16:04.683 --> 01:16:05.749
That is creepy, actually.

01:16:05.751 --> 01:16:08.351
- What else has she seen?
- That is over the line!

01:16:08.353 --> 01:16:09.520
Shut up!

01:16:09.522 --> 01:16:12.891
Listen, you lemmings!
This is my town.

01:16:12.893 --> 01:16:15.627
You are nothing
but a bunch of extras.

01:16:15.629 --> 01:16:19.363
We are going to march down
that hill and do a live show.

01:16:19.365 --> 01:16:21.032
I expect you to convince

01:16:21.034 --> 01:16:23.534
those brainless peons
out there in the audience

01:16:23.536 --> 01:16:26.069
that this is the perfect place
to buy a house,

01:16:26.071 --> 01:16:28.739
or none of you will be living
here much longer.

01:16:28.741 --> 01:16:30.408
- Do you hear me?
- Actually, Mom,

01:16:30.410 --> 01:16:32.142
everyone can hear you.

01:16:32.144 --> 01:16:34.311
You've been live
this whole time.

01:16:34.313 --> 01:16:37.782
Three million people
are watching you right now.

01:16:37.784 --> 01:16:39.784
The real you, for a change.

01:16:39.786 --> 01:16:42.319
Please, what do I care what
a bunch of bloggers think?

01:16:42.321 --> 01:16:43.421
Margaux?

01:16:43.423 --> 01:16:44.489
What?

01:16:44.491 --> 01:16:46.157
It's the network.

01:16:46.159 --> 01:16:48.292
They're taking your show
off the air.

01:16:48.294 --> 01:16:49.459
What?

01:16:49.461 --> 01:16:51.895
No. I'll be...
I'll be bankrupt.

01:16:51.897 --> 01:16:53.330
Who will buy all these houses?

01:16:53.332 --> 01:16:56.266
Okay, watch this.
Now's my chance.

01:16:56.268 --> 01:17:00.070
Excuse me,
I just tooted.

01:17:00.072 --> 01:17:02.073
Furthermore,
I think I can help you

01:17:02.075 --> 01:17:03.608
get rid of those houses.

01:17:03.610 --> 01:17:05.676
- What are you talking about?
- Well, my dear,

01:17:05.678 --> 01:17:08.578
you've got a bunch of houses
you need to get rid of,

01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:11.183
and I've got a bunch of family
I need to get rid of.

01:17:11.852 --> 01:17:13.316
Hello?

01:17:13.318 --> 01:17:16.087
Excuse me. I'm Trudy.

01:17:16.089 --> 01:17:20.158
Trudy Pickering. We...
We never officially met...

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:22.592
Ah, yes. The toilet woman.

01:17:22.594 --> 01:17:23.793
Right.

01:17:23.795 --> 01:17:28.632
Listen, uh, please, give us
a chance to make it right.

01:17:28.634 --> 01:17:32.304
Let us have
our own design intervention.

01:17:33.305 --> 01:17:34.372
Mother,

01:17:34.374 --> 01:17:36.840
I spent time
with these people,

01:17:36.842 --> 01:17:40.810
and it is true, they are odd.

01:17:40.812 --> 01:17:42.512
But we shouldn't judge them

01:17:42.514 --> 01:17:44.516
just because
they're different.

01:18:07.307 --> 01:18:08.838
- Have a wonderful day!
- Whoo-hoo.

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:09.907
And there you are.

01:18:09.909 --> 01:18:11.143
- Bye-bye.
- Thanks! Bye!

01:18:16.883 --> 01:18:18.516
Well, hello there!

01:18:18.518 --> 01:18:21.319
Howdy, neighbor.
How's the new house?

01:18:21.321 --> 01:18:25.021
Oh, I love it. I hope
you brought your umbrellas.

01:18:25.023 --> 01:18:28.859
Oh, you put in a typhoon.
What a great idea.

01:18:28.861 --> 01:18:30.761
Don't forget
the gift basket, silly.

01:18:30.763 --> 01:18:32.163
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:18:32.165 --> 01:18:34.565
We got scented
embalming fluid,

01:18:34.567 --> 01:18:37.334
toes, teeth, a fruitcake,

01:18:37.336 --> 01:18:40.038
rat bait,
got some dried apricots...

01:18:41.273 --> 01:18:44.208
He's like training a puppy,
adorable but tiresome.

01:18:44.210 --> 01:18:46.211
She's the woman of my dreams!

01:18:46.213 --> 01:18:48.878
Her breath is like
a baby's diaper.

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:51.282
Fester, stop!

01:18:51.284 --> 01:18:54.752
Who would have thought
a guy like me, a total zero,

01:18:54.754 --> 01:18:58.021
would have ended up with you,
an also zero?

01:18:58.023 --> 01:18:59.959
Well, do come in!

01:19:02.795 --> 01:19:06.129
Now, with
the house rebuilt, Pugsley,

01:19:06.131 --> 01:19:10.402
we can throw you
the celebration you deserve!

01:19:11.237 --> 01:19:15.075
You are Addams
through and through.

01:19:32.924 --> 01:19:36.896
<i>Get out!</i>

01:19:37.897 --> 01:19:40.564
Oh, how lovely.
The spirit's home.

01:19:40.566 --> 01:19:43.769
Finally, back to normal.

01:19:49.808 --> 01:19:51.141
We did good.

01:19:51.143 --> 01:19:53.079
I won't tell anyone
if you don't.

01:20:14.433 --> 01:20:16.367
<i>They're creepy
And they're kooky</i>

01:20:16.369 --> 01:20:18.368
<i>Mysterious and spooky</i>

01:20:18.370 --> 01:20:20.370
<i>They're altogether ooky</i>

01:20:20.372 --> 01:20:21.842
<i>The Addams family</i>

01:20:22.441 --> 01:20:24.342
<i>There house is a museum</i>

01:20:24.344 --> 01:20:26.343
<i>Where people come
to see 'em</i>

01:20:26.345 --> 01:20:28.346
<i>They really are a scream</i>

01:20:28.348 --> 01:20:29.783
<i>The Addams family</i>

01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:31.952
<i>Neat.</i>

01:20:32.985 --> 01:20:33.987
<i>Sweet.</i>

01:20:36.856 --> 01:20:38.221
<i>Petite.</i>

01:20:38.223 --> 01:20:40.190
<i>So get a witch's shawl on</i>

01:20:40.192 --> 01:20:42.193
<i>A broomstick
You can crawl on</i>

01:20:42.195 --> 01:20:44.194
<i>We're gonna pay a call on</i>

01:20:44.196 --> 01:20:46.832
<i>The Addams family</i>

01:20:48.867 --> 01:20:50.300
<i>Family, family</i>

01:20:50.302 --> 01:20:52.336
<i>I'd go to war for my family</i>

01:20:52.338 --> 01:20:55.207
<i>Ups and downs
Wrong or right, it's family</i>

01:20:55.974 --> 01:20:57.041
<i>They think that we crazy</i>

01:20:57.043 --> 01:20:59.243
<i>They say that we crazy,
can't handle it</i>

01:20:59.245 --> 01:21:02.980
<i>My back on the wall
Who I'mma call, my family</i>

01:21:02.982 --> 01:21:06.450
<i>We different, we stick out
Wig out, bug out</i>

01:21:06.452 --> 01:21:08.218
<i>Pop out, hop out
Go</i>

01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:09.986
<i>Ball out, hey
Show out</i>

01:21:09.988 --> 01:21:11.221
<i>A'ight, this a party</i>

01:21:11.223 --> 01:21:13.556
<i>Let's not make a problem
No!</i>

01:21:13.558 --> 01:21:17.095
<i>Why you looking at me like
there's something, tell me</i>

01:21:17.097 --> 01:21:19.997
<i>You should know it's not just
me that you'll be rubbing</i>

01:21:19.999 --> 01:21:22.669
<i>The wrong way,
so you better think twice</i>

01:21:24.036 --> 01:21:27.404
<i>You shouldn't mess with me
You don't want to mess with me</i>

01:21:27.406 --> 01:21:30.874
<i>'Cause if you mess with me
You're messing with my family</i>

01:21:30.876 --> 01:21:32.275
<i>You shouldn't mess with me</i>

01:21:32.277 --> 01:21:33.610
<i>You don't want to mess with me</i>

01:21:33.612 --> 01:21:34.744
<i>No!</i>

01:21:34.746 --> 01:21:35.946
<i>'Cause if you mess with me</i>

01:21:35.948 --> 01:21:37.782
<i>You're messing with my family</i>

01:21:37.784 --> 01:21:41.084
<i>Ay, ay, ay, ay</i>

01:21:41.086 --> 01:21:44.523
<i>You might think
that we are all loco</i>

01:21:45.223 --> 01:21:46.891
<i>Ay, ay, ay</i>

01:21:46.893 --> 01:21:48.258
<i>Don't mess
with my family</i>

01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:51.261
<i>But this family
about to go global</i>

01:21:51.263 --> 01:21:52.431
<i>We blowin' up!</i>

01:21:54.700 --> 01:21:55.802
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

01:21:56.568 --> 01:21:57.700
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

01:22:12.585 --> 01:22:13.751
<i>Don't mess with my family</i>

01:22:13.753 --> 01:22:16.386
<i>A'ight, this a party
Let's not make a problem</i>
