It's very expensive.

01:53.970 --> 01:56.430
Look, I got money to spend in here.

01:56.550 --> 02:01.430
I don't think we have anything for you. You're obviously in the wrong place.

02:01.560 --> 02:03.600
Please leave.

02:03.730 --> 02:07.440
You know, even though we've watched "Pretty Woman" like 36 times...

02:07.560 --> 02:11.360
- I never get tired of making fun of it.
- Oh, I know.

02:12.860 --> 02:16.530
Aww, poor thing. Look! They won't let her shop.

02:16.660 --> 02:20.660
Yeah, like those salesgirls in Beverly Hills aren't bigger whores than she is.

02:20.780 --> 02:22.700
I know!

02:24.290 --> 02:27.540
Oh, my God, listen to that sad, sad music as she leaves.

02:28.380 --> 02:30.250
It's like, boo-hoo. Uhh.

02:32.750 --> 02:34.920
But it is actually kind of sad.

02:38.340 --> 02:41.260
Anything you see here we can do, by the way. Get ready to have some fun, okay?

02:41.390 --> 02:43.520
- Okay.
- Mary Pat, Mary Kate, Mary Frances, Tovah.

02:43.640 --> 02:47.020

- How divine!

02:47.140 --> 02:49.860
Exactly how obscene...

02:49.980 --> 02:54.110
I just get really happy when they finally let her shop.

02:56.110 --> 02:58.030
Okay, so I have nothing to wear.

02:58.150 --> 03:00.820
We don't even have time to make anything new before we go out.

03:00.950 --> 03:03.200
Well, what about this?

03:03.330 --> 03:07.870
- Did you lose weight?
- Actually, I have been trying this new fat-free diet I invented.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.920
All I've had to eat for the past six days are Gummi Bears, jelly beans, and candy corns.

06:38.460 --> 06:41.580
Yeah, Ramon. That'll happen.

06:41.710 --> 06:45.260
Sorry, ma'am. He is such an asshole.

06:45.380 --> 06:48.130
Mm.

06:48.260 --> 06:50.930
- I'm in a hurry.
- Well...

06:51.050 --> 06:56.680
I'm going as fast as I can, Ms Mooney. Heather.

06:56.810 --> 06:59.020
Heather Mooney?

06:59.140 --> 07:01.310

07:03.360 --> 07:06.860
- Yeah?
- It's Romy!

07:06.980 --> 07:09.360
- Romy White!
- You're shittin' me.

07:09.490 --> 07:12.990
No, this is so weird. I didn't know you were living in L.A.

07:13.120 --> 07:16.540
Well, now that you know, will we be getting together a lot?

07:18.870 --> 07:21.830
So, God! You're driving a new Jaguar?

07:21.960 --> 07:24.420
- What do you do?
- Ever hear of Lady Fair cigarettes?

07:24.540 --> 07:28.510
- The ones that burn down real fast?
- "Twice the taste, in half the time, for the gal on the go"?

07:28.630 --> 07:32.800
I invented the quick-burning paper.

07:34.010 --> 07:35.890
Wow!

07:36.010 --> 07:38.640
- You goin' to the reunion?
- What reunion?

07:38.770 --> 07:41.560
Our ten-year high school reunion in Tucson?

07:41.690 --> 07:45.230
You're kidding me. It's been ten years since high school?

07:45.360 --> 07:49.990
- God. Where have I been?
- I'm stumped. Where?

07:50.110 --> 07:53.570
- Anyway, are you going?
- I'd rather put this out in my ass.

07:55.410 --> 07:57.620
I wonder why we didn't get an invitation.

07:57.740 --> 08:00.410
I mean, I'm sure Michele would have told me if she got one.

08:00.540 --> 08:02.710
- Michele Weinberger?
- Mm-hmm.

08:04.380 --> 08:06.920
- Do you live with Michele Weinberger?
- Yeah.

08:09.710 --> 08:12.010
I just thought maybe she'd be married to Sandy by now.

08:12.130 --> 08:14.680
- Sandy Frink?
- Yes, Sandy Frink.

08:14.800 --> 08:17.010
He could barely contain his erection every time she was around.

08:17.140 --> 08:20.180
Why do you think he always carried that huge notebook?

08:20.310 --> 08:23.310
The Frink-a-zoid and Michele, I am sure.

08:23.440 --> 08:27.400
Besides, didn't you have a thing for Sandy in high school?

08:27.520 --> 08:32.650
I did not have a "thing." I did not have a "thing." I did not have a "thing."

08:32.780 --> 08:34.740
I was very much in love with him.

08:34.860 --> 08:37.200
Very much in love, and there's a difference.

08:38.780 --> 08:41.789
There's a difference.

08:41.909 --> 08:43.789
There's a difference.

08:45.920 --> 08:48.130
I have to go now.

08:50.250 --> 08:54.800
Well! I guess I won't be seeing you at the reunion.

08:54.930 --> 08:57.180
- But I'll tell everyone you said "hi."
- Why don't you tell everyone...

08:57.300 --> 09:00.850
I said to go fuck themselves, for making my teen years a living hell?

09:00.970 --> 09:02.600
Oh, yeah, right!

09:05.810 --> 09:08.900
Finally...

09:10.570 --> 09:14.860
Michele. You will never guess who I just ran into.

09:17.160 --> 09:20.830
- God, I cannot believe it's already been ten years.
- I know.

09:20.950 --> 09:23.450
- Oh.
- You know...
- There she is.

09:23.580 --> 09:27.080
Oh! God, she was so weird.

09:27.210 --> 09:30.420

10:32.310 --> 10:35.900
for us to have our picture taken together?

10:36.030 --> 10:39.900
Yeah, well, Danny Weller, like, "lodged the complaint," and, you know...

10:40.030 --> 10:43.410
'Cause, "alphabetically, he's supposed to be between us."

10:45.240 --> 10:48.540
And then we said, "Okay, Danny. If you want to be between us...

10:48.660 --> 10:51.670
"you can come to Michele's house on Friday night, and we'll be waiting."

10:51.790 --> 10:53.880
That's right. He came over and we're like, "Danny, it was a joke."

10:54.000 --> 10:56.710
I know! And then we turned the sprinklers on him!

10:58.800 --> 11:02.680
Oh, my God. Didn't he die?

11:04.390 --> 11:06.350
- I think so.
- Yeah.

11:09.060 --> 11:12.690
- Oh, my God. Michele. Look at the "A" group.
- Mm-hmm.

11:12.810 --> 11:15.270

11:15.400 --> 11:17.690

11:22.740 --> 11:25.740
Oh. The drama crowd. You know, like Casey Degan and Mark Black.

11:25.870 --> 11:30.250
- Uh-huh. God, I had the hugest crush on Casey. 'Member?
- Oh, yeah.

11:47.550 --> 11:49.680

11:49.810 --> 11:53.640

11:56.520 --> 11:59.900

Well, you know, I'm not sure that we were really in any group.

12:31.010 --> 12:33.850

14:01.060 --> 14:04.570
I cannot believe he's with Christie Masters.

14:04.690 --> 14:07.610
I know. She is, like, so transparent.

14:07.740 --> 14:09.740
Did you hear her report in Miss Weigatt's class?

14:09.860 --> 14:14.030
She actually thinks she's gonna be a TV anchorwoman. What a "deludanoid."

14:16.990 --> 14:19.620
Those weirdos are staring at us again.

14:19.750 --> 14:22.710
- They're obsessed with us.
- Look at what they're wearing.

14:22.830 --> 14:25.380
Where do you even get outfits that hideous?

14:25.500 --> 14:28.420
They made them in Home Ec from their own patterns.

14:28.550 --> 14:31.090
Actually, I think they're semi-interesting.

14:35.350 --> 14:39.430
In a freakish, off-putting sort of way. Never mind.

14:39.560 --> 14:41.440
- Christie.
- Uh.

14:41.560 --> 14:44.400
No, Billy. Wait. I wanna have some fun.

15:03.210 --> 15:07.920

15:08.050 --> 15:11.920

Yeah, you should. It'll be fun.

15:30.900 --> 15:35.200
- Okay. Why not?
- Yeah. So, um, what musical are they doing?

15:35.320 --> 15:38.370
- "The Music Man."
- You're kidding!

15:38.490 --> 15:42.040
Oh, the Wells Fargo wagon ls a-comin' down the street

15:42.160 --> 15:45.000

I-I-l thought I ought to tell you, Michele, that...

16:30.170 --> 16:34.670
Christie Masters stuck magnets on your back.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.720

17:24.680 --> 17:28.890
God, remember the prom? You got so thin by then.

17:28.980 --> 17:34.570
Oh, I know. I was so lucky, getting mono. That was, like, the best diet ever.

17:34.690 --> 17:38.530
I wonder, if I had gotten my brace off sooner, if somebody would have invited me.

17:38.650 --> 17:40.860
I mean, other than Sandy Frink.

17:40.990 --> 17:43.160
Well, nobody invited me either.

Do you think, since it's the last night of school and I might never see him again...

19:23.340 --> 19:26.590
that maybe he would dance with me?

19:26.720 --> 19:29.430
I bet he would. I mean, it's senior prom.

19:29.550 --> 19:31.930

19:46.570 --> 19:49.570
would you care to dance with me once?

19:49.700 --> 19:51.870
No.

19:54.040 --> 19:57.620

- Okay. Well, the reunion is still like two weeks away, right?
- Right.

27:22.610 --> 27:27.030
And all we really need is maybe some, like, better jobs and boyfriends. Right?

27:27.150 --> 27:29.570
Yeah!

27:29.700 --> 27:34.200
But, okay. If those things were so easy to get, wouldn't we already have them?

27:34.330 --> 27:36.240
Well, I mean, we never really tried before.

27:36.370 --> 27:40.080
I mean, we never really had a good enough reason, like going to a reunion, to motivate us.

27:40.210 --> 27:42.130
That's true.

27:42.250 --> 27:46.800
Okay. So we're just gonna have to make ourselves more impressive, that's all.

27:46.920 --> 27:50.760
So I'm gonna go out and bag us some boyfriends, while you can look for a cool new job.

27:50.880 --> 27:53.300
- Okay.
- Plus, I hate to say it...

27:53.430 --> 27:55.390
but I really think that we should lose some weight.

27:55.510 --> 27:57.390
Oh.

28:00.440 --> 28:03.150
Oh. Unh.

28:03.270 --> 28:06.860
Okay. I don't think that, like, one chip makes a difference.

28:06.980 --> 28:09.150
It wasn't even a whole chip.

28:17.790 --> 28:22.870
All right. According to this chart, if we want to lose a pound a day...

28:23.000 --> 28:25.460
we have to burn twice as many calories as we eat.

28:25.590 --> 28:29.760
So, that means, if we want to burn 4,000 calories...

28:31.170 --> 28:33.220
we only have to run 20 miles a day!

28:33.340 --> 28:36.680
Oh! Hey, Romy, remember Mrs Chivas' class?

28:36.800 --> 28:38.850
There was, like, always a word problem.

28:38.970 --> 28:41.230
Like, there's a guy in a rowboat going "X" miles...

28:41.350 --> 28:44.810
and the current is going, like, you know, some... other miles...

28:44.940 --> 28:47.650
and, how long does it take him to get to town?

28:47.770 --> 28:52.450
It was like, who cares? Who wants to go to town with a guy who drives a rowboat?

28:52.570 --> 28:55.240
Okay, guys, let's jump.

28:58.830 --> 29:02.620
- Hey, Michele?
- Yeah?
- What does this remind you of?

29:02.750 --> 29:05.460
Well, I know. This lady is totally sick.

29:12.800 --> 29:14.840
Uh, lemme just say that, um...

29:14.970 --> 29:18.390
I am, like, really familiar with the entire Versace line, and if you would just...

29:18.510 --> 29:23.930
give me a chance, I know I could, like, sell the shit out of the stuff.

29:24.060 --> 29:28.440
And, uh, to me, fashion is just, it's like...

29:28.560 --> 29:31.280
everything. It's...

29:31.400 --> 29:34.820
By the way, that blouse... Hi. That blouse looks great on you.

29:34.950 --> 29:38.870
- Oh! Thank you!
- And see, I make a great salesperson...

29:38.990 --> 29:41.120
'cause I just have this, like, really believable way...

29:41.240 --> 29:45.500
of telling people that they look really good, even though I'm just, like, you know...

29:50.670 --> 29:53.880
I think she heard me.

29:54.010 --> 29:57.130
Thank you so much for coming.

29:57.260 --> 30:01.680
- That's okay, you're welcome.
- I don't think we'll be requiring any new staff.

30:01.810 --> 30:04.850
- You aren't taking on any what?
- Staff. Employees.

30:04.980 --> 30:07.190
Ohh! Oh, "staff."

30:07.310 --> 30:10.060
Okay, I didn't understand with your big accent.

30:10.190 --> 30:13.230
I couldn't figure it out. Okay.

30:15.570 --> 30:19.450
Fine. You know, you really shouldn't let people fill out applications...

30:19.570 --> 30:24.080
if you don't want them to actually try to get a job here.

30:24.200 --> 30:29.170
- It's a compli...
- No, no. That's all I have to say.
- Goodbye.

30:41.090 --> 30:45.720
- Yes. Yes, it is.
- I thought so. So, what do you do?

30:45.850 --> 30:48.940
- I'm a suit salesman.
- Oh, uh-oh

30:49.060 --> 30:53.900

Yeah, well, my first choice was to work at a boutique on Rodeo Drive, but this would be okay.

31:19.510 --> 31:23.760
Well, thank you. Unfortunately, we don't have any openings here right now.

31:23.890 --> 31:25.760
- Are you serious?
- Mm.

31:25.890 --> 31:30.310
Although we might have an opening at our discount outlet.

31:30.440 --> 31:33.560
Okay, well, what street would that be on?

31:54.960 --> 32:00.670
Come on, Michele. At this point, any job is better than no job at all.

32:00.800 --> 32:03.510
A discount outlet? Me?

32:05.430 --> 32:07.680
Fine.

32:07.810 --> 32:10.390
So, any boyfriends yet?

32:10.520 --> 32:15.980
No. All the guys with good jobs must be going to some other club.

32:16.110 --> 32:19.980
Oh, you know where Dana met her new boyfriend? He's a William Morris agent.

32:20.110 --> 32:23.900
Oh! Showbiz! Good job! Where?

32:25.490 --> 32:28.870
Hi. My name is Romy, and I'm an alcoholic.

32:28.990 --> 32:32.960
- Hi, Romy!
- Hey.

32:33.080 --> 32:36.670
And you also get a five-percent employee discount...

32:36.790 --> 32:39.380
over and above our everyday low prices.

32:39.500 --> 32:43.260
You could make curtains for the motorhome with this.

32:43.380 --> 32:47.600
- I got this tie for a dollar.
- You paid a whole dollar for that?

32:47.720 --> 32:50.510
- You betcha.
- Ah!

32:55.980 --> 32:58.560
She's one of our regulars.

33:00.570 --> 33:04.610
So, what do you think?

33:04.740 --> 33:07.570
I-I'd like to go away.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.340
I know I'm supposed to wait in that line, but listen.

33:22.460 --> 33:26.430
I wouldn't even be here if this weren't, like, a dating emergency.

33:26.550 --> 33:30.890
Our cutoff is 25. Try VH-1.

33:50.530 --> 33:55.450
The reunion's less than a week away. I mean, I just can't believe you turned down a job.

33:55.580 --> 33:58.120
Well, I thought the idea was to impress people.

33:58.250 --> 34:02.920
I mean, how am I going to impress anyone by selling Ban-Lon smocks at Bargain Mart?

34:06.880 --> 34:09.630
I'm sick of this. I'm gonna go weigh myself.

34:21.440 --> 34:27.239
Oh, God! I've been killing myself for eight days and I gained a pound.

34:27.360 --> 34:31.870
That's impossible! Did you deduct 16 pounds for your shoes?

34:31.989 --> 34:35.239
Just forget it. I'm not going.

34:35.370 --> 34:39.250
- What?
- Come on. Get real, Michele. We're idiots.

34:39.370 --> 34:44.540
We can't get jobs and boyfriends, and lose weight, in two weeks.

34:44.670 --> 34:47.260
But I thought you said we could.

35:12.950 --> 35:17.290
Wow. God, the top female executives are all so pretty.

35:19.500 --> 35:23.210
Those aren't the actual executives, Michele. Those are models.

35:23.330 --> 35:26.000
Oh, I thought they looked familiar.

35:26.130 --> 35:29.420
God, they really look like executives, don't they?

35:29.550 --> 35:31.590
That's only because they're wearing those stupid suits...

35:31.720 --> 35:34.640
and phoney glasses, and carrying briefcases.

35:34.760 --> 35:40.220
- Huh!
- Oh, my God, Michele, that's it!

35:40.350 --> 35:43.390
We can go to the reunion, and just pretend to be successful!

35:43.520 --> 35:45.770
I mean, who's gonna know? They're in Tucson, we're here.

35:45.900 --> 35:48.360
We could just show up looking like businesswomen.

35:48.480 --> 35:51.740
Oh, my God! Oh!

35:51.860 --> 35:55.910
Wait. Ohh. But if the people at the reunion see us drive up in a Nova...

35:56.030 --> 35:58.830
won't they know we're not really businesswomen?

35:58.950 --> 36:01.580
If you can make us the clothes...

36:01.700 --> 36:04.670
I can get us the car.

36:17.550 --> 36:21.680
Clear out, boys. I need to talk to Ramon.

36:21.810 --> 36:23.680
Go!

36:27.940 --> 36:30.770
Yes, cara m韆?

36:30.900 --> 36:34.360
Michele and I have this high school reunion to go to...

36:34.490 --> 36:37.240
and we need to show up in a really cool car.

36:37.360 --> 36:40.410
- Yeah?
- Todd told me that he gave you a really great deal...

36:40.530 --> 36:46.120
- on an XJS convertible and that you're fixing it up.
- Yeah?

36:46.250 --> 36:49.840
So...

36:49.960 --> 36:52.630
can I borrow your car?

36:52.750 --> 36:55.420
Well, if I loan you my car...

36:55.550 --> 36:58.300
what do I get?

36:58.430 --> 37:02.310
- Uh, what do you want?
- Ohh, Romy...

37:02.430 --> 37:04.470
you know what I want.

37:04.600 --> 37:08.650
Oh, forget it. I'm not going to have sex with you just to borrow your stupid car!

37:08.770 --> 37:10.940
I gotta get something.

37:13.690 --> 37:15.820
Okay.

37:15.940 --> 37:21.450
Close the blinds, and we'll work something out.

37:23.410 --> 37:27.160
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh, Ramon!

37:27.290 --> 37:30.420
- Ohh, Ramon, ohh! Ohh!
- Check this out.

37:30.540 --> 37:33.420
- Oh, yes. Ohh.
- Oh, yeah.

37:33.550 --> 37:35.840
- Oh, man!
- Ohh! Ohh!

37:35.960 --> 37:38.760
Ohh, Ramon! Ohh, Ramon!

37:38.880 --> 37:41.680
Ohh! Oh, yes.

37:43.970 --> 37:46.020
You are Columbus, and I am America.

37:46.140 --> 37:49.690
Discover me, Ramon! Just discover me.

37:49.810 --> 37:53.480
Hey, uh... Explosions. The earth is moving.

37:53.610 --> 37:58.280
Explosions! The earth is moving!

37:58.400 --> 38:02.820
Ah, ooh... is that an earthquake? No, it's Ramon.

38:02.950 --> 38:08.040
Is that an earthquake? No, it's Ramon!

38:08.160 --> 38:10.410
Ahh! It's Ramon!

38:10.540 --> 38:14.710
Man stallion, fill me with your giant love wand!

38:14.840 --> 38:16.920
What? No, I'm sorry. I don't think so.

38:17.050 --> 38:20.420
Well, say something nice about my penis!

38:20.550 --> 38:23.930
Oh, Ramon, your penis is so powerful. I'm coming!

38:24.050 --> 38:27.890
- Okay, thanks. Get off me now.
- Aw, come on, wh...

38:28.020 --> 38:30.560

- Aww.

38:54.670 --> 38:58.170
Oh, this is gonna be so much fun.

38:58.300 --> 39:00.630
- So, what'd you have to do to get it?
- I had to give all the guys...

39:00.760 --> 39:03.760
in the service department hand jobs.

39:03.880 --> 39:06.930
Well, while you were doing that, I taped all the nostalgic songs...

39:07.050 --> 39:10.520
from high school, to get us in the mood.

39:10.640 --> 39:13.440
- Michele?
- Huh?
- I was kidding.

39:13.560 --> 39:17.770
- What?
- You actually think I would do something like that?

39:21.570 --> 39:24.320

42:40.580 --> 42:44.340
Yeah. Hello. Um, we need something to go.

42:44.460 --> 42:49.380
- Okay.
- Do you have some sort of businesswoman's special?

42:51.010 --> 42:53.180
- Come again?
- Well, we're businesswomen.

42:53.310 --> 42:57.930
- Yeah. From L.A.
- And you know some places have, like, a lunch special.

42:58.060 --> 43:00.900
For businesswomen.

43:01.020 --> 43:04.270
We don't have anything like that.

43:04.400 --> 43:08.030
Well, then why don't you just give us, um, two burgers and fries and Diet Cokes...

43:08.150 --> 43:11.570
- 'cause we're in a hurry.
- Mm. We're due in Tucson later.

43:11.700 --> 43:15.660
For a business thing. You know.

43:15.790 --> 43:17.790
What kind of business you in?

43:28.130 --> 43:31.130
I can't believe we never thought of what to say we did for a living.

43:31.260 --> 43:33.930
Oh. Which one of these guys...

43:34.050 --> 43:36.810
will I have sex with at the reunion?

43:38.020 --> 43:40.230
Ooh! Casey Degan!

43:40.350 --> 43:43.440
- Aaah!
- Come on! Now, we're running out of time.

43:46.150 --> 43:50.030
I know. Why don't we say that we own our own company?

43:50.150 --> 43:52.570
Ooh, good. Like what?

43:52.700 --> 43:56.450
- Like, what if we invented something?
- Like what?

43:56.580 --> 44:00.910
Well, okay, l-l think it should be like something that-that everybody has heard about...

44:01.040 --> 44:04.130
but-but nobody really knows who invented it.

44:04.250 --> 44:06.420
Oh, my God! I've got it! Post-Its!

44:06.540 --> 44:09.800
- Everybody knows what Post-Its are!
- Yeah!

44:09.920 --> 44:13.130
They're the little yellow things with the stickum on the back, right?

44:13.260 --> 44:15.260
Okay.

44:15.390 --> 44:18.260
Okay, we're-we're working in this advertising agency after college.

44:18.390 --> 44:20.480
- Ooh, college! Good one!
- Yeah.

44:20.600 --> 44:23.810
And we have, like, this big, like, presentation...

44:23.940 --> 44:25.810
to make to, like, a client.

44:25.940 --> 44:28.730
- Hmm!
- So-so-so we're, like, brainstorming...

44:28.860 --> 44:31.490
and all of the sudden we're out of paper clips!

44:31.610 --> 44:34.990
- Good!
- And so, okay... So then I, I, like...

44:35.110 --> 44:37.330
Okay, I say... I say... Okay...

44:37.450 --> 44:40.750
"Wouldn't it be great if there was, like, this, like, stickum on the back of this paper...

44:40.870 --> 44:44.870
"so, like, it-it would just... if I laid it on top of that other paper it would just stay...

44:45.000 --> 44:46.880
"you know, like, without a paper clip?"

44:47.000 --> 44:48.630
- Yes!
- Ahh!

44:48.750 --> 44:50.960
So then you've got, like, this grandfather or this uncle...

44:51.090 --> 44:53.720
that, like, has, like, a... like a... like a paper company or a paper mill...

44:53.840 --> 44:56.840
and-and he's, like, really into it, and the rest is history!

44:56.970 --> 44:59.350
Oh, my God! It is perfect!

44:59.470 --> 45:02.560
Wow! Don't you think?

45:02.680 --> 45:05.520
Well, yeah, but...

45:05.640 --> 45:08.650
- "Well, yeah, but" what?
- I don't know.

45:08.770 --> 45:11.900
I mean, it just sounds like you invented Post-Its all by yourself, you know.

45:12.030 --> 45:15.530
- I mean, what did I do?
- Well, it was your grandfather or uncle.

45:16.990 --> 45:18.530
Yeah?

45:18.660 --> 45:21.540
Okay, you know, so we could say that...

45:21.660 --> 45:23.540
you were, like, the designer.

45:23.660 --> 45:26.870
Like, I thought of them, but you thought of making them yellow.

45:28.880 --> 45:31.550
Well, no, but it's like most of these people...

45:31.670 --> 45:34.050
have, like, known us since elementary school.

45:34.170 --> 45:37.050
I just think that you're more believable as a designer...

45:37.180 --> 45:40.850
rather than as an inventor, you know?

45:40.970 --> 45:43.720
- Uh-huh.
- <i>♪ You're my lover ♪</i>

45:43.850 --> 45:47.190
<i>♪ Not my rival ♪</i>

45:47.310 --> 45:49.190
- What are you doing?
- Look.

45:50.360 --> 45:52.190
You're obviously pissed at me.

45:52.320 --> 45:54.190
No. Uh-uh. Why should I be pissed at you?

45:54.320 --> 45:56.400
Just because now I know how you really feel about me.

45:56.530 --> 45:58.360
Oh, my God, I knew this would happen.

45:58.490 --> 46:01.700
I mean, I try, for once, to be honest with you...

46:01.830 --> 46:03.700
and it blows up in my face.

46:09.120 --> 46:11.840
God! You wanna be honest?

46:11.960 --> 46:14.840
Okay, good! Let's be honest!

46:16.210 --> 46:18.090
I let you have the ideas!

46:18.220 --> 46:20.260
- What?
- Yeah, I let you have the ideas...

46:20.390 --> 46:22.890
so you won't feel so bad that I'm cuter.

46:23.010 --> 46:26.770
- You are not cuter, Michele.
- I am so cuter.

46:26.890 --> 46:29.390
It's, like, common knowledge, Romy. Everybody thinks so.

46:29.520 --> 46:32.060
I'm the Mary and you're the Rhoda.

46:32.190 --> 46:34.650
That's ridiculous. You're the Rhoda. You're the Jewish one.

46:34.770 --> 46:37.650
Oh, my God. I'm talking cuteness-wise, Romy, okay?

46:37.780 --> 46:39.950
And cuteness-wise, I'm the Mary.

46:40.070 --> 46:44.450
That's crazy! You have absolutely no proof that you're cuter!

46:44.580 --> 46:47.080
Oh, proof? You want proof? Okay, fine.

46:47.200 --> 46:49.750
- Who lost their virginity first?
- Oh, big wow!

46:49.870 --> 46:52.960
With your cousin Barry. I wouldn't brag about it.

46:53.080 --> 46:57.630
Okay, so who always gets asked to dance first when we go to clubs, huh?

46:57.760 --> 47:00.170
No wonder you couldn't find us boyfriends, Romy.

47:05.140 --> 47:07.720
Well, so what? You can't even get a job!

47:07.850 --> 47:11.810
- I carry you, Michele! Without me, you'd be lost!
- That is such a lie!

47:11.940 --> 47:14.810
Oh, yeah? Well, let's just see. Let's split up and see what happens.

47:14.940 --> 47:17.030
W-What do you mean, split up?

47:17.150 --> 47:20.990
When we get to Tucson, we're going our own separate ways.

47:21.110 --> 47:23.030
Okay. Good.

47:23.160 --> 47:25.030
Fine. I don't care.

47:25.160 --> 47:26.870
- Fine!
- Fine.

47:26.990 --> 47:29.160
As of Tucson, we're finished.

47:30.250 --> 47:32.460
Well, drive fast!

My God, you... you look fantastic.

48:55.580 --> 48:59.420
I mean, I... I never would have recognized you in a million years.

48:59.540 --> 49:01.880
Thanks.

49:02.000 --> 49:05.630
So, what have you been doin' since high school?

49:05.760 --> 49:09.140
Well, believe it or not...

49:09.260 --> 49:11.470
I invented Post-Its.

49:22.650 --> 49:24.190
So I told Prescott...

49:24.320 --> 49:27.780
"You can either pay me the 150 or I am out of here. Bye-bye."

49:27.900 --> 49:32.120
I mean, there are at least 12 other major markets that would put me on the air tomorrow.

49:32.240 --> 49:35.250
Wow. So you did it? You're an anchorwoman?

49:35.370 --> 49:39.120
No. I'm a weather girl.

49:39.250 --> 49:41.670
On the highest-rated 5:00 news in Tucson.

49:41.790 --> 49:43.630
- Oh.
- So...

49:43.750 --> 49:47.470
Michele, what are you up to?

49:47.590 --> 49:51.140
Uh, okay. Um, I invented Post-Its.

49:51.260 --> 49:53.970
- You're kidding!
- You must've made a fortune!

49:54.100 --> 49:56.140
Well, yeah.

49:56.270 --> 49:58.140
No offence, Michele...

49:58.270 --> 50:01.350
but how in the world did you think of Post-Its?

50:03.270 --> 50:06.440
Um... well...

50:06.570 --> 50:08.440
uh...

50:10.570 --> 50:13.200
And I invented them totally by myself.

50:13.320 --> 50:17.290
I mean, all Michele did was say, "What about making them yellow?"

50:18.410 --> 50:20.290
Really?

50:26.920 --> 50:31.840
- Actually, I invented a special kind of glue.
- Oh, really?

50:31.970 --> 50:34.680
Well, then I'm sure you wouldn't mind giving us a detailed account...

50:34.800 --> 50:39.020
of exactly how you concocted this miracle glue, would you?

50:39.930 --> 50:43.190
No. Um...

50:44.360 --> 50:47.190
Well, ordinarily when you make glue...

50:47.320 --> 50:50.650
first you need to thermoset your resin...

50:50.780 --> 50:55.030
and then after it cools you mix in a, um, epoxide.

50:55.160 --> 50:57.450
Which is really just a fancy-schmancy name...

50:57.580 --> 51:00.870
for any simple, oxygenated adhesive, right?

51:01.000 --> 51:05.080
But then I thought maybe... just maybe... you could raise the viscosity...

51:05.210 --> 51:09.260
by adding a complex glucose derivative during the emulsification process.

51:09.380 --> 51:12.380
And it turns out, I was right.

51:14.180 --> 51:16.550
Huh? I don't believe it.

51:16.680 --> 51:20.180
You must be the most successful person in our graduating class.

Romy! You will not believe what just happened!

Michele, can't you see that I am busy?

Fine. Okay, just forget it.

I have boxes of Kleenex in my limo.

52:30.960 --> 52:32.840
Let me make it up to you.

52:35.920 --> 52:37.300
Okay.

52:47.390 --> 52:50.190
Oh, my God.

52:50.310 --> 52:53.820
- Here. Help yourself, Michele.
- Thanks.

52:56.280 --> 52:59.490
It's me, Michele. Sandy.

52:59.610 --> 53:02.450
- Sandy Frink?
- Uh-huh.

53:02.580 --> 53:04.990
But you're so dreamy.

53:05.120 --> 53:07.000
Well, when I made my first million...

53:07.120 --> 53:10.210
my present to myself was a new face.

53:10.330 --> 53:12.210
Okay, I'm not just saying this...

53:12.340 --> 53:14.550
but you really picked a good one.

53:14.670 --> 53:16.670
Thanks.

53:18.220 --> 53:20.340
I had this notebook...

53:20.470 --> 53:24.640
with "Mrs Romy Christianson" written on it, like, about a thousand times.

53:26.770 --> 53:29.640
Now you think I'm some sort of geek.

53:31.270 --> 53:33.730
No. No.

53:33.860 --> 53:36.980
No, not at all.

53:38.490 --> 53:40.700
I'm flattered.

55:17.040 --> 55:18.840
What vote?

55:18.960 --> 55:23.760
The person voted Most Changed for the Better Since High School is...

55:25.380 --> 55:29.260
It's a tie. It's a tie.

55:46.780 --> 55:48.660

Duh.

58:33.280 --> 58:35.160

58:37.820 --> 58:42.910

58:43.040 --> 58:45.330
Oh, no. No, Sandy.

58:45.460 --> 58:47.290
Oh, good.

58:47.420 --> 58:51.000
I've just been lonely with no one to talk to.

58:53.840 --> 58:56.130
Why don't you call her?

58:57.510 --> 58:59.390
- Okay.
- Yeah.

59:06.020 --> 59:09.190
- Hello?
- Billy Christianson?

Oh, no, no, I'm-l'm Billy Junior.

59:12.690 --> 59:17.030

59:17.160 --> 59:18.950
Well, yeah.

59:19.070 --> 59:22.660
Yeah, but, uh, she can't come to the phone right now.

Billy, honey...

59:29.330 --> 59:34.210
tell your mommy that Michele Weinberger-Frink...

59:34.340 --> 59:36.220
is on the phone...

59:36.340 --> 59:40.470
and would very much like to speak with her.

59:46.850 --> 59:49.230
No.

59:49.350 --> 59:51.360
Not until you admit...

59:51.480 --> 59:54.900

Oh, God.

01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:29.940
Oh, we're really here.

- Good evening, sir.

01:01:29.290 --> 01:01:31.620
Um, anybody see Billy Christianson?

01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:34.500

01:01:57.150 --> 01:01:59.520

And, um, Romy is already inside.

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:07.990
- I could care less. I am not here with Romy.
- You're kidding me.

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:10.370
No, we're not even friends any more.

01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:13.540
We had this big falling out over Post-Its.

01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:16.750
- Post-Its?
- It's a long story.

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:18.750

Hi, Romy. How are you?

01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:01.250
- Lisa Luder?
- Yes.

01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:05.300
So, where's the rest of the "A" group?

01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:07.800
Oh, they're around here someplace.

01:03:07.930 --> 01:03:10.050
We sort of lost touch over the years.

01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:14.220
Wow. Isn't it weird when you're not friends with your friends any more?

01:03:14.350 --> 01:03:19.150
I mean, Michele and I just fell out of touch about two hours ago.

01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:21.150
Because she's selfish...

01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:23.570
and she always, like, devalues me.

01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:25.570
And I'm sick of it, you know?

01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:32.280
God, you guys are easy to talk to.

01:03:32.410 --> 01:03:34.290
I invented Post-Its.

01:03:36.790 --> 01:03:40.460
- You know, the yellow things with the stickum on the back?
- Yes, I know what they are.

01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:43.340
So, uh, what are you up to?

01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:47.510
I'm an associate fashion editor for Vogue.

01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:50.930
Wow! Wh... Good job!

01:03:51.050 --> 01:03:54.310
Boy, I must have, like, every single issue of Vogue...

01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:57.560
for the past ten years.

01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:00.850
Okay, well, it was very nice talking with you.

01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:03.150
Nice talking to you too.

01:04:04.770 --> 01:04:07.650
Okay, Romy.

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:26.380
It was so cute.

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:28.880
My mom gave us a new car seat for the baby.

01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:32.010
And when the box arrived, little Jake looks up at me and says...

01:04:32.130 --> 01:04:34.220
"Mommy, is that the baby?"

01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:37.470
- Oh.
- I wish.

01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:39.770
Hey, everyone.

01:04:39.890 --> 01:04:42.770
- And so we meet again.
- Oh, hi.

01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:45.150
Romy White.

01:04:46.650 --> 01:04:48.530
You're the chubby girl.

01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:53.160
Oh, well, I was, but I haven't been for a really long time.

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.820
So, what are all of you up to?

01:04:55.950 --> 01:04:58.830
Christie, in the yearbook you said that you wanted Jane Pauley's job.

01:04:58.950 --> 01:05:01.910
Are you a big TV news anchorwoman now?

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:05.540
Oh, no, I don't even watch TV any more.

01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:09.380
My priorities have changed since I became a mommy.

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:12.010
Can you believe this is number three?

01:05:12.130 --> 01:05:14.510
Wow, three kids.

01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:16.760
God, you must feel really tied down.

01:05:18.510 --> 01:05:21.890
Not at all. I feel very fulfilled.

01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:25.900
Besides, Billy always wanted a big family.

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:31.400
- Billy Christianson?
- Mm-hmm.

01:05:31.530 --> 01:05:34.570
- You married Billy Christianson?
- Mm-hmm.

01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:37.320
For almost ten years now.

01:05:37.450 --> 01:05:40.200
Billy's in real estate development.

01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:45.080
So, how about you? Any kids?

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:47.790
Oh, uh, no.

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:51.750
I just haven't had time, you know, what with running my own business and all.

01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:53.760
Your own business?

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:57.470
Yeah. I invented Post-Its.

01:05:58.970 --> 01:06:00.930
No, really. What do you do?

01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:06.640
That's what I do. I invented Post-Its.

01:06:06.770 --> 01:06:09.810
Oh. You're kidding me.

01:06:12.570 --> 01:06:14.740
Well, I've made a lot of money.

01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:17.910
Oh, you know who they say has made a ton of money? Sandy Frink.

01:06:18.030 --> 01:06:19.910
- The Frink-a-zoid?
- Yeah.

01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:23.740
He invented some special kind of rubber that's used in every tennis shoe in North America.

01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:26.460
Hey, if anybody needs to make a call...

01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:29.130
I've got a phone.

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:48.480
- Is Sandy Frink here?
- Uh, no.

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:51.480
- Uh, you can't go in without a name tag.
- Fuck off!

01:06:51.610 --> 01:06:55.940
Heather Mooney? Oh, my God, you're exactly the same.

01:06:56.070 --> 01:06:58.610
Oh, my God. Heather Mooney is here?

01:07:01.490 --> 01:07:03.830
This ought to be so good.

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:09.620
Oh, God, don't look now. It's Heather Mooney.

01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:12.500
- What?
- Hello, Romy.

01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:15.130
Uh... E... Uh... You...

01:07:15.250 --> 01:07:18.840
Oh, uh... Heather, you said you weren't coming.

01:07:18.970 --> 01:07:22.510
Yeah, well, since Sandy and Michele aren't married...

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:25.010
What a waste of a tank of gas, huh?

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:28.600
Okay, well, come on. I'll help you go find him.

01:07:28.730 --> 01:07:32.190
Uh, he's not here. I already asked Toby Dumbfuck. Obviously, I've interrupted.

01:07:32.310 --> 01:07:35.230
Why don't you just go back to ignoring me like you did in high school?

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:37.230
No, you can stay.

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:41.660
We're just discussing our class success stories. So, what are you up to?

01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:44.740
Ever hear of Lady Fair cigarettes? I invented the quick-burning paper.

01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:48.160
- Wow, we have a whole class full of inventors.
- Meaning?

01:07:48.290 --> 01:07:50.160
Oh, you know, Sandy Frink invented something too.

01:07:50.290 --> 01:07:53.170
- Hey, isn't that Sandy over there now?
- What did Sandy invent?

01:07:53.290 --> 01:07:57.840
- Some kind of rubber.
- Romy here invented Post-Its.
- You did not.

01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.010
- Yeah, I did.
- You did not.

01:07:59.130 --> 01:08:00.090
- Yeah, I did.
- You did not.

01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:01.510
Yeah, I... Well, who did then?

01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:03.840
A guy named Art Fry from the 3M Corp.

01:08:03.970 --> 01:08:06.430
We studied it in business school.

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:10.890
You're kidding me.

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:13.730
You just made all that up?

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.870
Oh, God, you are so weird.

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:33.620
- Why don't you just leave her alone?
- Michele.

01:08:33.750 --> 01:08:36.920
Oh, it's the back brace girl.

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:39.750
- Hi, back brace girl.
- Hi, back brace girl.

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:42.760
Oh, shut up.

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:44.930
And what are you picking on us for anyway?

01:08:45.050 --> 01:08:47.430
We are not the ones who got fat.

01:08:47.550 --> 01:08:50.430
We're pregnant, you half-wit.

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:53.430
Oh, yeah, well...

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:56.729
I hope your babies look like monkeys.

01:08:56.850 --> 01:08:58.770
Come on, Romy.

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:14.910
- Oh, Romy.
- Oh, please, go away. Just leave me alone.

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:19.130
Why did I even come back here?

01:09:19.250 --> 01:09:21.920
Well, you know what? There are worse things than telling some dumb story...

01:09:22.050 --> 01:09:24.010
and having everybody laugh at you.

01:09:24.130 --> 01:09:29.640
- Like what?
- Like losing your best friend.

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:31.640
You know? I mean, I had the worst dream, Romy.

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:36.060
I dreamt that we weren't friends and we were really, really old.

01:09:36.189 --> 01:09:38.850
But I mean, like, we were, like, really, really old.

01:09:38.979 --> 01:09:41.020
And-And we weren't friends.

01:09:43.069 --> 01:09:46.319
I can't stand that we're mad at each other.

01:09:46.450 --> 01:09:49.410
Okay, I'm sorry I said all those things.

01:09:49.529 --> 01:09:52.370
You're as cute as me. You are.

01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:56.290
And-And in some cultures, maybe cuter.

01:09:56.410 --> 01:09:58.830
I'm sorry too.

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:03.130
I shouldn't have said that you weren't smart enough to invent Post-Its.

01:10:03.250 --> 01:10:06.130
Well, I mean, maybe I'm not.

01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:10.140
Although in my dream, I did know the formula for glue.

01:10:13.810 --> 01:10:16.140
So, are we friends again?

01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:19.810
Well, duh.

01:10:22.150 --> 01:10:24.070
Okay.

01:10:24.190 --> 01:10:26.070
And you know what, it doesn't even matter...

01:10:26.190 --> 01:10:29.400
that we told, like, what, four people some dumb lie.

01:10:29.530 --> 01:10:31.870
Who cares?

01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:34.660
Hi, everybody.

01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:38.040
Settle down. Hi.

01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:41.790
I'm Christie Masters-Christianson.

01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:47.340
I have been asked to formally welcome you all...

01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:51.130
to Sagebrush High's ten-year reunion.

01:10:57.930 --> 01:11:01.310
We have come a long way in the past ten years.

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:04.400
Our own Lisa Luder is helping set the style for the country...

01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:07.150
as a fashion editor for "Vogue" magazine.

01:11:16.030 --> 01:11:18.660
And Travis McKinney is in his fifth year...

01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:22.040
as a member of the Dallas Cowboys football team.

01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:27.250
And...

01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:29.760
Romy and Michele claimed...

01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:32.590
they invented Post-Its.

01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:54.780
All I ever wanted was for people to think...

01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:56.780
that we were better than we were in high school.

01:11:56.910 --> 01:12:00.290
And now we're just a stupid joke, just like we always were.

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:04.750
No, Romy.

01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:07.750
Can I tell you the truth?

01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:12.880
I never knew that we weren't that great in high school.

01:12:13.010 --> 01:12:15.380
I mean, we always had so much fun together.

01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:17.510
I thought high school was a blast.

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:20.810
And until you told me that our lives weren't good enough...

01:12:20.930 --> 01:12:24.480
I thought everything since high school was a blast.

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:27.310
I think we should go back out there as ourselves...

01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:30.320
and just have fun like we always do.

01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:32.440
The hell with everyone else.

01:12:32.570 --> 01:12:35.360
I don't think I can.

01:12:35.490 --> 01:12:38.700
Well, do you think you can stop being such a baby?

01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:41.870
God, I feel like I've been, like...

01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:43.870
chasing you all over this reunion.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.870
We have come all this way.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.670
Now we are going to enjoy ourselves whether you like it or not.

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:54.760
God, Michele, I've never seen this side of your personality before.

01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:56.840
You're so bossy and domineering.

01:12:58.470 --> 01:13:02.560
- I like it.
- Me too.

01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:30.540
Post-Its must be really lucrative.

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:40.390
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- Oh, yeah, Michele, I am so sure.

01:13:42.970 --> 01:13:45.520
What the hell is your problem, Christie?

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:48.020
Why are you always such a nasty bitch?

01:13:49.730 --> 01:13:52.560
Do you get some kind of sick pleasure from torturing other people?

01:13:52.690 --> 01:13:56.230
I mean, yeah, okay, so Michele and I did make up some lame story.

01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:59.070
We only did it because we wanted you to treat us like human beings.

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:01.070
But you know what I finally realized?

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:04.280
I don't care if you like us 'cause we don't like you.

01:14:04.410 --> 01:14:06.290
You're a bad person with an ugly heart...

01:14:06.410 --> 01:14:09.290
and we don't give a flying fuck what you think.

01:14:15.130 --> 01:14:17.760
- Come on, Michele.
- Okay.

01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:20.630
And, yeah.

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:23.800
It's unbelievable. They're as deluded about their lives...

01:14:23.930 --> 01:14:25.970
as they are about those hideous clothes.

01:14:27.890 --> 01:14:31.100
Actually, Christie, they've got nice lines...

01:14:31.230 --> 01:14:33.440
a fun, frisky use of colour.

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:37.900
All in all, I'd have to say they're really not bad.

01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:51.460
Well, we still think they're ridiculous.

01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:53.460
Don't we, girls?

01:14:59.590 --> 01:15:02.800
Why don't you just let them think for themselves for once?

01:15:02.930 --> 01:15:05.430
You're just jealous...

01:15:05.550 --> 01:15:10.850
because unlike a certain ball-busting, dried-up career woman I might mention...

01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:13.350
we're all happily married.

01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:15.650
That's right, Christie.

01:15:15.770 --> 01:15:17.860
Keep telling yourself that.

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:33.000
- I do love those outfits.
- Yeah, sure do.

01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:35.040
- Oh, great.
- Thanks.

01:15:35.170 --> 01:15:37.170
Michele made them.

01:15:37.290 --> 01:15:41.170
Well, I just sewed them. We both designed them.

01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:43.970
- Fifty-fifty.
- Wow.
- Yeah.

01:15:44.090 --> 01:15:45.800
That's so cool.

01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:49.390
Well, it's been really terrific seeing all of you.

01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:51.680
- Come on, Michele.
- Oh, okay, bye.

01:15:52.770 --> 01:15:53.640
Hi.

01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:59.690
I am sorry that I blew your big lie for you.

01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:03.530
Hey, that's okay. It was better this way anyway.

01:16:03.650 --> 01:16:07.870
It's ironic, isn't it? I really thought you guys had it made in high school.

01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:09.660
- Us?
- Yes, you.

01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:12.580
With your long hair and your long legs...

01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:14.830
walkin' on your legs, flippin' your hair.

01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:16.870
I can't compete with that. You made Sandy crazy.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.590
And the whole time you were makin' my life hell...

01:16:19.710 --> 01:16:22.210
the "A" group was making your life hell; I didn't know.

01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:26.880
You know what? I bet in high school everybody made somebody's life hell.

01:16:27.010 --> 01:16:31.260
Mm-mmm, not me. Never had the opportunity to make anyone's life hell.

01:16:31.390 --> 01:16:34.890
You know what? I bet that's not true. You were really unpleasant.

01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:36.890
- You think?
- Oh, yeah. God.

01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:39.230
Heather? Oh, I'm off duty.

01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:42.020
Um, since you never got around to it in high school...

01:16:42.150 --> 01:16:44.740
I was wondering if you could sign my yearbook.

01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:47.990
And, uh, please don't tell me to fuck off...

01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:50.070
because it really hurts my feelings.

01:16:51.450 --> 01:16:54.620
- I hurt your feelings?
- Yeah, all the time.

01:16:54.750 --> 01:16:57.620
Tremendous! That's tremendous!

01:16:57.750 --> 01:17:00.290
Go get your stupid yearbook. I would be happy to sign it.

01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:04.210
Okay, great. I'll-l'll be right back, okay?

01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:07.170
Michele, I think maybe we should leave.

01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:09.800
There is no way this reunion is gonna get any better.

01:17:09.930 --> 01:17:14.970
Hey, everybody, Sandy Frink just landed in a helicopter!

01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:18.140
Sandy Frink has a helicopter?

01:17:18.270 --> 01:17:20.100
Yeah. Apparently he's worth, like, millions.

01:17:20.230 --> 01:17:23.770
He invented some kind of special rubber or something.

01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:26.480

- After all these years, you still take my breath away.
- Thanks.

01:18:39.850 --> 01:18:43.310
So you must be, like, the most successful person...

01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:45.350
in our entire graduating class.

01:18:46.810 --> 01:18:50.030
Well, I guess that depends on how you define "success."

01:18:50.150 --> 01:18:53.860
If, to you, success means having a house in Aspen...

01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:57.830
one in Acapulco, a penthouse in New York, a mansion in Malibu...

01:18:57.950 --> 01:19:00.580
a 60-foot yacht, an eight-seat Windstar...

01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:03.710

01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:05.710

01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:08.040
then, yeah...

01:19:08.170 --> 01:19:10.250
I guess I am successful.

01:19:12.010 --> 01:19:15.340
But no matter how much I accumulate...

01:19:15.470 --> 01:19:18.720
there's still one thing I just don't have.

01:19:19.890 --> 01:19:21.560
Your own country?

01:19:23.810 --> 01:19:25.850
I don't have you, Michele.

01:19:29.650 --> 01:19:31.610
Will you dance with me?

01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:37.360
Only if Romy can dance with us.

to go to those clubs every night.

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:46.370
Come on.

01:21:50.250 --> 01:21:53.000
Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:55.040
What do you want?

01:21:55.170 --> 01:21:58.710
You were right. I was a brain-dead, redneck asshole.

01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:00.880
Although I never screwed a sheep or my sister.

01:22:01.010 --> 01:22:03.180
Why not? Couldn't catch 'em?

01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:07.390
I guess I deserve that. I was a jerk.

01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:11.060
But I was so miserable in high school...

01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:14.190
I don't think I spoke more than two words the entire time.

01:22:14.310 --> 01:22:18.400
I just couldn't breathe there, you know?

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:20.900
Plus, I had this really bad stutter.

01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:26.030
Listen, you, uh, wanna go somewhere quiet?

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:28.240
Somewhere where we can talk?

01:22:28.370 --> 01:22:31.790
- You-You wanna talk to me?
- Yeah.

01:22:33.210 --> 01:22:35.330
Okay, cowboy, I don't know what your trip is...

01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:38.420
- but if this is some kind of a sick game...
- What? No.

01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:41.260
If you fuck with me in any way, I will rip...

01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:44.630
each and every appendage from your body, starting with your dick, capisce?

01:22:46.050 --> 01:22:49.760
Look, I j-just w-wanted to talk.

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:54.770
Okay.

01:22:54.890 --> 01:22:56.810
What the hell.

01:22:57.980 --> 01:22:59.360
What is your name?

01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:01.360
- Clarence.
- I like your hat, Clarence.

01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:03.400
- Thank you.
- Pick up the pace.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.540
You wait here. I'll prep my chopper.

01:23:16.670 --> 01:23:18.540
- Okay.
- All right.

01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:23.210
Oh, my God, somebody's puking in the bushes.

01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:25.220
Eeewww!

01:23:28.260 --> 01:23:30.470
Hey, how you guys doin'?

01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:32.760
Billy?

01:23:33.930 --> 01:23:37.480
- Chubbo?
- The name is Romy.

01:23:39.190 --> 01:23:41.190
Romy and Michele.

01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:47.450
So, weren't you guys, like, totally in love with me in high school?

01:23:47.570 --> 01:23:49.700
She was.

01:23:56.620 --> 01:23:58.830
You wanna get a room?

01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:01.290
But you're married.

01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:04.840
- To Christie.
- Yeah, but you've got children...

01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:08.130
and you're a successful real estate developer.

01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:13.350
I do drywall for her old man's construction company.

01:24:13.470 --> 01:24:17.180
And-And you know this new kid? Don't even know if he's mine.

01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:20.900
So...

01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:23.310
How about that room?

01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:29.900
Okay.

01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:34.490
Why don't you go and get that room?

01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:38.200
Go and wash your face and take off all your clothes...

01:24:38.330 --> 01:24:40.370
and I'll be up there in five minutes.

01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:42.210
All right!

01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:47.210
Your fantasy is gonna come true...

01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:49.380
tonight.

01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:53.050
- See you later.
- Ugh... Okay.

01:25:00.180 --> 01:25:04.560
- God.
- Now he's gonna see what it feels like to wait.

01:25:04.690 --> 01:25:07.530
- That's such a good one.
- Ladies.

01:25:09.650 --> 01:25:15.030
- God, can you believe we're going home in a helicopter?
- I know. It's so cool.

01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:18.700
I just wish everybody inside the reunion would come out and see us lift off.

01:25:18.830 --> 01:25:20.370
Ohh!

01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:22.370
Thank you.

01:25:25.790 --> 01:25:27.380
Oh.

01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:37.430
Oh, my God! I'm so glad you didn't bring your big notebook with you.

01:26:31.650 --> 01:26:33.530
Thanks for stopping by.

01:26:33.650 --> 01:26:35.650
Yeah. Enjoy your fashions.

01:26:35.780 --> 01:26:37.660
Have a Romy and Michele day.

01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:40.330
- That was a good one.
- Thanks.

01:26:40.450 --> 01:26:42.790
I cannot believe how busy we've been.

01:26:42.910 --> 01:26:46.790
I know. Hey, maybe we can pay back Sandy this week.

01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:49.880
Um, I think we're about, like, two years away from that.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.840
Oh. Okay.

01:26:59.300 --> 01:27:02.850
Heather, um, has anyone ever told you that smoking can kill you?

01:27:02.970 --> 01:27:06.140
No. No one. Thank you.

01:27:06.270 --> 01:27:08.850
Okay, but if you burn it, you bought it.

01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:11.480
Like I give a shit. I look like an asshole.

01:27:11.610 --> 01:27:13.860
What? Nuh-uh. You look totally cute.

01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:18.530
This dress exacerbates the genetic betrayal that is my legacy.

01:27:18.660 --> 01:27:20.990
Okay, I don't even know what you're talking about because of those words...

01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:22.990
but come here.

01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:26.200
- Ow!
- God, that has been bugging me.

01:27:26.330 --> 01:27:30.080
- Stay away from my bikini area.
- Um, okay.

01:27:30.210 --> 01:27:33.380
- I'm in a rush. Ring it up if you must.
- Okay.

01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:35.550
Let me have the tag, please.

01:27:35.670 --> 01:27:37.550
Thank you.

01:27:37.670 --> 01:27:39.550
You really do look cute.

01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:46.140
- You know what?
- Huh?

01:27:46.270 --> 01:27:50.520
Despite that surly demeanour, I think we've just given her a big gift.

01:27:50.650 --> 01:27:52.860
Okay, I mean, to give someone...

01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:56.570
like Heather Mooney the chance to express herself through fashion...

01:27:56.690 --> 01:27:59.110
We could've really changed her life.

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:02.320
Yeah. For me though, it's like...

01:28:02.450 --> 01:28:05.330
I've given birth to my own baby girl, you know?

01:28:05.450 --> 01:28:07.500
Only she's, like, a big giant girl...

01:28:07.620 --> 01:28:10.500
who smokes and says "shit" a lot.

01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:13.580
- You know?
- Yeah.

01:28:13.710 --> 01:28:17.380
- Yeah. Let's fold scarves!
- Okay.

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:21.800
- You know what, Michele?
- Huh?

01:28:21.930 --> 01:28:24.430
I think you are, like, the funnest person I know.

01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:26.760
