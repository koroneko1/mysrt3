This is not unusual.

680
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:07,940
When I was seven years old,

681
00:30:08,074 --> 00:30:11,477
one Tuesday, my father
came home quite drunk.

682
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:14,446
Really drunk.

683
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,948
Also, not unusual.

684
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:19,585
My mother grew angry and
screamed at him,

685
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:22,754
at which point,
he proceeded to
wrap a telephone cord

686
00:30:22,889 --> 00:30:24,523
around her neck
and pull it tight.

687
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:27,193
I wept.

688
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,795
I screamed,
I begged him to stop.

689
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:31,663
To make him stop,

690
00:30:31,797 --> 00:30:35,467
I finally had to
stab him in the thigh
with kitchen scissors.

691
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:42,241
You remember that,
Mother, don't you?

692
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:45,811
Now, I suppose I should've
stabbed him in the throat
that evening.

693
00:30:45,945 --> 00:30:48,680
But we're not so smart
when we're young.

694
00:30:49,615 --> 00:30:51,884

695
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:54,186

Jeremy created
the next dish.

863

It's called "The Mess."

864
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,823
Originally from
Sparks, Nevada,

865
00:39:17,956 --> 00:39:22,127
Jeremy studied at the Culinary
Institute in Hyde Park.

866
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:25,397
Jeremy's goal, as he wrote
in a heartfelt letter,

867
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:27,899
was to work for me
here at Hawthorn.

868
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,669
Isn't that right, Jeremy?

869
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:32,438
Yes, Chef.
(CLICKS TONGUE)

He's good.

872
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,447

(SNIFFLES)

But he's not great.

He'll never be great.

00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:54,860
He desperately wants
my prestige,
my job, my talent.

876

He aspires to greatness,
but he'll never achieve it.

00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:01,667
Correct, Jeremy?

878
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,134
Yes, Chef.

879
00:40:03,268 --> 00:40:05,103
Like me at his age,

880
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,607
Jeremy has forsaken everything
to achieve his goals.

881
00:40:10,108 --> 00:40:14,212
Like mine,
his life is pressure.

882
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:17,616
Pressure to put out
the best food in the world.

883
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:22,253
And even when all goes right,
and the food is perfect,

884
00:40:22,387 --> 00:40:25,223
and the customers are happy,
and the critics are, too,

885
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:28,126
there is no way
to avoid the mess.

of your life,

of your sanity,

888
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:41,473
by giving everything you have
to pleasing people you will
never know.

00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:44,142

890
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:46,812

dreamed about?

892
00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:51,917
No, Chef.
Mmm-hmm.

893
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,284
And do you
want my life?

894
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,955
Not my position,
nor my talent.

00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,089

with those who give,
or with those who take?

you have to decide.

01:37:55,137 --> 01:37:57,505
The purifying flame.

1880

It nourishes us, warms us,

1881
01:38:00,808 --> 01:38:06,214
re-invents us, forges and
destroys us.

1882
01:38:06,348 --> 01:38:08,383
We must embrace the flame.
