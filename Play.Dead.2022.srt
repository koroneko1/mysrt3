[car alarm chirps]

5
00:01:17,345 --> 00:01:19,347
[girl] My...my name
is Chloe Albright.

6
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,715
I am a second-year
medical student.

7
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:25,119
Yes, of course. Yeah.

8
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,521
No, I just... I, um...

9
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:30,090
I don't understand
this foreclosure notice.

10
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:35,429
Yeah, no, I spoke to
the regional manager, actually,

11
00:01:35,463 --> 00:01:37,365
on...on March 25th

12
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:40,100
and then again on May 17th.

13
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:43,604
What?

14
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,208
No... No, no, no. I...

15
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:48,542
Yeah, no, I know that,

16
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:50,744
but my student loan
got suspended

17
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:54,382
and my dad's life insurance,
it never paid out.

18
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,619
Why?

19
00:02:00,388 --> 00:02:02,323
Because suicide isn't covered.

20
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,728
Look, um...

21
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:12,132
This...this house is all that
my brother and I have left, OK?

22
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:15,035
No.

23
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:17,205
No, you...you cannot
take it from us, OK?

24
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:18,706
If you evict us from our home,

25
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,441
then we will have
nowhere else to go.

26
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:23,143
Hello?

27
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:26,647
Hello?

28
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:31,419

a cautionary tale

37
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:57,177

40
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:03,451
..b-bitches that run the show.

41
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:05,453
You know, I mean,
they read the book and go,

42
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:07,288
"Hey, th-th-these
are some great ideas.

46
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:16,163
b-b-believe that shit?

47
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,332
And cell phones. Cell phones.

48

That's real b-big brother

49
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:23,871
except they don't need
to brainwash us to use them.

50
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:26,440
We pay for the privilege.

51
00:03:26,474 --> 00:03:28,542
I mean, cops, politicians,

52
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:30,210
they don't protect and serve us.

53
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:33,481
They protect and serve
the hard-cash overlords from us.

54
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:36,016
They sell us the idea of freedom

55
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,218
while making sure
we never get it.

56
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:43,123
It's...it's all psychopaths
who say, "2 plus 2 equals 5,"

57
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,225
who say the best we're gonna get

58
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:48,296
is...is a boot in the face.

59
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:51,164
Bro! Could you just
shut the fuck up?

60
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:53,834
No, no, because if you ask me...

61
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:56,737
Shut... Hey, give me
the fuckin' book!

62
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,839

67
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:10,083
OK.

68
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:13,721
We got this.

-Alright.
-No, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:17,558
What are you doing, Book Club?

71
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,627
You're the driver.
You're stayin' here.

72
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:23,163
I... Yeah, no, I know. I, um...

73
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,599
You know, I hate to be
the one to tell you this.

74
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:26,934
I don't have a licence.

75
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:28,168
You don't have
a driver's licence?

76
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,269
-Yeah.
-Oh, holy fuck.

77
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:30,704
What are we gonna do about you

78
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:32,105
not having
a driver's licence right now?

79
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,407
I...I...I don't know.

-[sighs]
-I don't know.

81
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,044
Dude, guess I'm just gonna
have to fuckin' kill you.

82
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:38,912
Whoa, whoa! OK, wait.
You said no-one was gonna...

Dude, I could have poked
my fucking eye out!

87
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:47,921
What do you think, I got
a real gun or something?

88
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,957
No, I don't know, I don't know!

89
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,625

Oh, you know so fucking much?

Yes, I know, I know. I just...

94

Look, I'm just... Look,
I'm still getting my cut, right?

95
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:04,171
TJ, I'm only doing this
so you get your fucking cut.

96
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:06,940
-You know that, right?
-Yes, I do.

97
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,409
That's the only reason I'm here.

98
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:09,877
I know.

99
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,579
Thanks.

You just...keep it runnin'.

00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:25,726
-Just be careful, OK?
-Yeah. [chuckles]

106
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,495
-[TJ] Alright?
-Alright.

107
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:30,130
Right pedal, gas.
Left pedal, brake.

108
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,665
Brake. Yeah, I know.

109
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,941
Less than a minute, alright?

110
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:42,943
Yeah, just hurry, OK?

-[TJ] Shit, Chloe! God.
-Yeah, shit is right.

135
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:17,170
What the hell were you thinking?

136
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:20,641
[stutters] No...no-one
was supposed to get hurt.

137
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:23,877
OK? Ross said that it...

138
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:27,715
Wait... Ross?

139
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:31,685
TJ, you...you pulled
this shit with Ross?

140
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:33,687
I couldn't do it alone.

141
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:37,424
I've told you to stay away
from him so many times. [sighs]

142
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,794
You dated him for three years.
You know he's not a bad guy.

143
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:42,362
[Chloe] He's bad news, TJ.

144
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,231
[TJ groans]

145
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:46,099
-Fuck!
-It's out.

146
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,801
Chloe!

147
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,606
He's not a bad guy, OK?
He just...

148
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,043
Things got away from him.

149
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,578
Things didn't get away from him.

150
00:07:57,611 --> 00:08:00,313
He pushed them away.
We can't be like him, TJ.

151
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:02,983
-You cannot be like him.
-He's dead.

152
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:07,688
I think. I don't...

153
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,858
I don't know.

154
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:20,701
It's not easy...

155
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,637
..for me, Chloe, OK?

156
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:25,438
You know, you handle all...

157
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:28,175
You think that this
is easy for me?

158
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:33,480
No. No, I did this for you, OK?

159
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:36,784
-What?
-OK, I...

160
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:41,755
I know you're having
trou-trouble with tuition.

161
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,490
And...

162
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,158
..now they're gonna
take the house.

163
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,094
And I...I just
wanted to help, OK?

164
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,696
I know how this is
gonna affect you.

165
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:49,963
I just...I just want to help.

166
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:52,966
I couldn't just st-stand by...

167
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,004
..and let you go
through this, you know?

168

[Chloe mutters]

169
00:08:58,405 --> 00:08:59,907
No, I know.

170
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:04,878
I know, OK? I fucked up.

171
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:06,580
I fucked up.

172
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:11,284
[indistinct chatter
over police radio]

173
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:13,253
Another one bites the dust.

174
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:20,060
Yeah, get the coroner
and his meat wagon here ASAP.

175
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:22,195
I don't want the locals
looking at this dead hoodlum

176
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,631
bleeding in the street.

177

178
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,034
You get a plate
on our wheel man?

179
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,501
-[deputy] No plate, Sheriff.
-[sheriff] Description?

180
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:30,337
-[deputy] Ski masks.
-[officer on radio] Sheriff.

181
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,205
We've got a flaming car
out on Mission Road.

182
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,141
Sounds like a match
for your getaway vehicle.

183
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:35,743
Huh.

184
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:37,377
Well, ain't that a thing?

185
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:39,813
Looks like our wheel man's

186
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:41,548
the brains
of this cluster fuck.

187
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,817
[Chloe] OK, I'm going to
ask you some questions, yeah?

188
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:45,185
Mm-hmm.

189
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:47,020
-TJ?
-Yeah, yeah.

190
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:49,522
I need you to be
100% honest with me, OK?

191
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,028
OK, did anybody see you?

192
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:58,766
[TJ] No. We...we wore
masks and gloves.

193
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,835
OK, good. Uh, did you tell
anybody about this?

194
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:03,937
No, no, I swear.

195
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:05,605
And the car? What about the car?

196
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,375
I ditched it.
I...I set it on fire.

197
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:11,344
Fire? That's smart.

198
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:13,413
OK, um... Whose car was it?

199
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,882
Stolen.

200
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,885
OK, then, you're fine.

201
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:20,888
You're gonna be fine.

202
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:22,790
You're gonna...
you're gonna stay here with me.

203
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:25,025
Right? You're gonna...
you're gonna keep a low profile.

204
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:28,195
They have absolutely no reason
to think that you would...

205
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:29,596
[TJ murmurs]

206
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,034
-[Chloe] What?
-[mouths]

207
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,568
What?

208
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,538
Ross's phone.

209
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,273
What about Ross's cell phone?

210
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:43,310
I...I...
It's on...it's on him.

211
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:45,145
It's on him and I forgot.

212
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:46,814
I just...

213
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:49,049
It's...it's...

214
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:53,320
You planned a robbery

215
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:55,422
on a fucking iPhone?

216
00:10:57,357 --> 00:11:00,227
-Are they gonna go easy on me?
-Are they gonna go easy on you?

217
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,462
TJ, it is an armed robbery
where somebody ends up dead.

218
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,965
TJ, that is 25 to life.

219
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,567
But, you know,
I...I was only the driver.

220
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,636
You were only the driver?
You think that matters to them?

221
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,071
That doesn't matter to them.

222
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:13,673
And you going to jail,
that breaks my promise to Mom.

223
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,275
What are we gonna do?

224
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:21,114
We have to get the phone.

225
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:23,784
[TJ] How?

226
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:28,055
Just give me five minutes.

227
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:36,296
[Chloe] Out here,
regional budgets have been cut

228
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:38,431
and so the morgue
is pretty much a one-man shop.

229
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:40,768
And the sheriff's department,
it's overworked, understaffed.

230
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,602
The chief has been cracking down
on local meth-heads.

231
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:44,104
According to the news,
about an hour

232
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:45,472
before they
brought Ross's body in,

233
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,474
a girl was killed
when her car hit a tree.

234
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:50,377
So we know there are at least
2 bodies in there, 1 coroner.

235
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,980
Buys us some time to get inside
and find Ross's phone.

236
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:56,149
[TJ] Won't...won't his phone
be with the cops?

237
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:57,450
[Chloe] Not out here.

238
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:59,152
Ross and all he had on him

239
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:00,620
will be processed
at the morgue first.

240
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:01,955
His clothes, his phone,

241
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:03,156
everything will be
bagged and tagged

242
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,524
and locked in the evidence room

243
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,159
for the sheriff
to claim in the morning,

244
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:08,295
along with the coroner's
autopsy report.

245
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:11,064
Walk the perimeter,
look for access.

246
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:13,901
Yeah, and I'm sure they have
a back door for graverobbers.

247
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:15,668
[alarm buzzes]

248
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:19,239
[alarm buzzes]

249
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:24,711
[Chloe on intercom] Hello?

250
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,881
I...I'm a friend
of the girl who was in the...

251
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:29,316
..the car accident tonight.

252
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,852
I was hoping that
I could see her

253
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:34,187
for one last goodbye.

254
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,764
-[dog barking]
-Oh, fuck!

255
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:47,567
-[barking and snarling]
-Oh, fucking hell!

256
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,772
[TJ] Cujo's out back
and there's cameras everywhere.

257
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:55,075
-[dog barking]
-Fucking Fort Knox.

258
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,709
[barking]

259
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:58,278
Hello?

260
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:00,147
[TJ] This whole place
is locked down.

261
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:03,583
The only way
we're getting in

262
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,752
is through a fucking
body bag, you know?

263
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:12,559
-What if that can be arranged?
-Huh? What?

264
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:15,195
Do you still score Adderall
off that vet tech?

265
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,130
Yeah, yeah, you know,
it helps me focus.

266
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:18,798
I need you to call her.

267
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,337
Hey.

268
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:27,908
Whoa. Who is this?

269
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:31,811
Oh, this is my...my sister.

270
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:34,581
She...she's cool, so...

271
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:36,283
Hey.

272
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,185
Uh-huh.

273
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:44,925
-It's 50 for the Addy.
-And the propofol?

274
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,493
Listen, I got it.

275
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:48,628
But I need you to understand
that this shit is...

276
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,563
A sterile,
nonpyrogenic emulsion,

277
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:52,265
full name diisopropylphenyl.

278
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:53,466
It's used in the induction

279
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,568
and maintenance
of sedation anaesthesia,

280
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:58,405
and it works
by dramatically slowing down

281
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,440
the recipient's brain
and nervous system.

282
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:04,044
I study criminology
and forensic medicine.

283
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,148
150.

284
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,017
Come on. No deals today?

285
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,185
[TJ] Shh. Here.

286
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,357
So I hope y'all know
what y'all doin'.

287
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,160
That shit killed
the King of Pop.

288
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,965
Yeah.

289
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:27,500
[TJ] OK. Now what?

290
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:30,003
Now it's time to die.

291
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:37,210
[TJ] How does this,
uh, work exactly?

292
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:38,645
I inject it.

293
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:40,180
A few seconds later,
I'll be unconscious.

294
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,681
The propofol slows
my heart rate

295
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,517
and brain activity
to almost nothing.

296
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,119
I'll still be alive.

297
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:48,321
[TJ] I just have a bad feeling
about this, you know?

298
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:50,958
[Chloe] TJ,
it is after nine o'clock, OK?

299
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:53,360
By the morning, the sheriff is
going to be in that morgue,

300
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,162
hearing the results
of Ross's autopsy

301
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:56,663
and collecting his belongings.

302
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:59,132
How long after that do you think
it is going to take

303
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,701
until you are in custody?

304
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,975
Once I'm unconscious, you're
just gonna wait 30 minutes, OK?

305
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:09,709
What? Why?

306
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,879
Because I have to be cold
when they find me.

307
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,215
Otherwise, they'll...
they'll try to resuscitate.

308
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:18,885
Look, TJ, you are going
to wait 30 minutes.

309
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,521
You are then going to call 911
and you are going to say

310
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:23,756
that you saw a girl
OD in the underpass

311
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,425
and that you think
she might be dead,

312
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,827
but you aren't gonna give
a name or anything.

313
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,496
You understand that?

314
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:34,201
Yes, but as-assuming
this works,

315
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:36,003
how are you gonna get out?

316
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:39,039
Let's just worry about
getting me in first, yeah?

317
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:41,708
Look, I, um...
I should do this.

318
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:44,011
OK? Look, this was...
this was...

319
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:45,512
No, no, this was my mess-up.

320
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,214
Alright? Let me fix it.

321
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:50,417
[Chloe] You have any run-ins
with the local sheriff lately?

322
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:56,423
They won't remember me.

323
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:09,736
-Hey.
-[sighs]

324
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,138
Hey.

325
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:15,242
You know I love you.

326
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:17,110
Don't. Don't do that.

327
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,616
[dark music]

328
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:33,460
[Chloe exhales]

329
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,262
OK.

330
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:38,198
Hey, you alright?

331
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,134
OK, you gotta go.
You gotta get out of here.

332
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:46,706
OK.

333
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:49,442
Love you.

334
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:50,810
It's alright.

335
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:56,649
[dark music rises]

336
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:05,492
[heartbeat thudding and echoing]

337
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,316
[music intensifies]

338
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:47,734
[sheet ruffles loudly]

339
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:53,840
[metallic screeching]

340
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:18,931
[groans softly]

341
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,403
[grunts]

342
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:31,644
[shivers]

343
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,985
Oh!

344
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:55,402
[Chloe exclaims softly]

345
00:18:58,638 --> 00:18:59,772
OK.

346
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:02,175
OK.

347
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:04,777
[door handle rattles]

348
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,813
[keys jingling]

349
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:14,187
Oh...

350
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:17,490
Oh, shit! Sorry.

351
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:23,630
[tense music]

Chloe, what did they do to me?

535
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,570
They took your kidney, Ross.

536
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:35,541
[Ross] They what?

537
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:38,644
That's OK, though,
because you have another one.

538
00:39:38,677 --> 00:39:41,146
Son of a bitch.

539
00:39:42,514 --> 00:39:45,116
-[lock buzzes]
-Got it. Come on. Right now.

540
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,352
-OK.
-OK. Shh, shh, shh, shh!

541
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,387
[exhales] OK.

542
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:51,222
-[Ross groaning] Fuck!
-Shh, shh!

543
00:39:51,256 --> 00:39:52,824
Alright.

544
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:02,434
[door handle rattles]

545
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,048
[Ross panting]
I'll slow you down.

546
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:18,917
You know you...you just
gotta go, right?

547
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,652
-I'm not leaving.
-What?

548
00:40:20,686 --> 00:40:22,654
When I open this door,
you are going to run.

549
00:40:22,688 --> 00:40:24,422
I still need to get
into the evidence room.

550
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:26,191
-OK.
-[lock buzzes]

551
00:40:26,224 --> 00:40:28,393
OK. Almost there.

552
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:39,304
-[whirring]
-[Ross] Oh, shit. [groans]

553
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,942
[Ross] He sees us.

554
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:51,216
-Chloe...
-Shh!

555
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:52,551
[Ross] Shit.

556
00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:54,219
He knows we're in here.

557
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:56,822
-OK.
-Fuck.

558
00:40:59,424 --> 00:41:02,561
[tense music builds]

559
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:08,634
OK.

560
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,906
He's coming. He's coming.

561
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:18,276
Hey, hey, Chloe?
I'm...I'm sorry.

562
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,411
I fucked up.
I'm sorry for all of it.

563
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:22,581
I will stop him, OK?
You just fuckin' go.

564
00:41:22,614 --> 00:41:24,049
Hey.

565
00:41:24,082 --> 00:41:26,618
You cut the macho shit
right now, OK?

566
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:29,320
You left me once. You're not
fuckin' doing it again.

567
00:41:32,524 --> 00:41:33,925
OK...

568
00:41:36,962 --> 00:41:39,497
I shouldn't...
I shouldn't have ever left.

569
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:41,833
[Chloe] Where is it?
Last key, Ross.

570
00:41:41,867 --> 00:41:43,401
Here we go.

571
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:45,003
We're on the last one.

572
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:48,406
-[lock buzzes]
-I got it!

573
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:49,641
Ross!

574
00:41:49,675 --> 00:41:51,309
No. Ross.

575
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,279
Hey, I got the door, OK?
I need you to get up.

576
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:56,281
Come on, come on.
I need you to move.

577
00:41:56,314 --> 00:41:59,284
[speaks indistinctly]
OK, I need you to come.

578
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:01,186
[straining] Come on.

579
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:02,788
[grunts] OK.

580
00:42:02,821 --> 00:42:05,156
Come on, Ross.
[speaks indistinctly]

581
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,858
[both gasp]

582
00:42:06,892 --> 00:42:09,561
[gas hissing]

583
00:42:11,997 --> 00:42:14,700
[Chloe wheezes and coughs]

584
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,675
[Chloe coughs]

585
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:27,813
[gasps]

586
00:42:27,846 --> 00:42:29,648
[softly] Ross...

587
00:42:33,318 --> 00:42:35,921
Ross, Ross...

588
00:42:40,025 --> 00:42:42,460
[grunting]

589
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:44,329
[coroner] I doubt
he can hear you.

590
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:46,598
[liquid squelching]

591
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:50,869
OK...please,

592
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,671
please, just let us go.

593
00:42:52,704 --> 00:42:54,572
I won't say anything
to anybody, please.

594
00:42:54,606 --> 00:42:56,341
[coroner]
And where would you go?

595
00:42:56,374 --> 00:42:58,877
Back to your
rat-infested apartment?

596
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,879
To your tent city?

597
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:03,181
To your life of crime?

598
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:05,250
What? No.

599
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:09,721
No, that's...that's not me.

600
00:43:09,755 --> 00:43:11,156
Then what are you doing here?

601
00:43:11,189 --> 00:43:13,859
Attempting to claim that
which does not belong to you?

602
00:43:13,892 --> 00:43:15,894
Do you think you're
deserving of it in some way,

603
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,195
that you've earned it?

604
00:43:17,228 --> 00:43:19,831
Compensation for the toils

605
00:43:19,865 --> 00:43:22,100
and petty grievances
that you've accrued

606
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:24,903
during your time on this Earth?

607
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:27,739
-[rubber gloves squeaking]
-[Chloe clears throat]

608
00:43:27,773 --> 00:43:29,775
Maybe you feel like you got
dealt a bad hand

609
00:43:29,808 --> 00:43:30,942
and you should be allowed

610
00:43:30,976 --> 00:43:32,944
to slip a few extra aces
up your sleeve.

611
00:43:32,978 --> 00:43:34,713
You ever considered
getting a job

612
00:43:34,746 --> 00:43:38,083
or is...that completely
out of the question?

613
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:40,518
This country's filled
with people like you,

614
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:42,520
people who take, take, take.

615
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:44,522
They don't earn. You cheat.

616
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:46,725
You don't strive.
You cut corners.

617
00:43:46,758 --> 00:43:48,626
You take shortcuts.

618
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:51,529
No, that's not me, though.

619
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:53,732
Fortunately for me,

620
00:43:53,765 --> 00:43:58,436
you are all defined
by one undeniable truth.

621
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,805
All that you are...

622
00:44:02,173 --> 00:44:05,711
..all that you've done,
all of your thoughts,

623
00:44:05,744 --> 00:44:09,147
your feelings, your beliefs...

624
00:44:10,615 --> 00:44:12,984
..your entire being

625
00:44:13,018 --> 00:44:15,520
is worth considerably less...

626
00:44:17,689 --> 00:44:19,490
..than the sum of your parts.

627
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:23,661
No.

628
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:26,464
No, no, no, no. Please, please.

629
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,299
Please. OK? You're wrong.

630
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:29,667
I...I am a student

631
00:44:29,701 --> 00:44:31,502
and I know the opportunity
I have been given.

632
00:44:31,536 --> 00:44:34,472
-I wanna make something out...
-What are you studying?

633
00:44:35,707 --> 00:44:38,844
I study...I study...
forensic medicine.

634
00:44:42,814 --> 00:44:44,482
That's an
underappreciated field.

635
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,184
Yeah.

636
00:44:46,217 --> 00:44:47,853
Then you already know
that there are

637
00:44:47,886 --> 00:44:51,322
over a million dollars' worth
of assets inside of you.

638
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:55,761
Kidney, heart,
liver, lungs, eyes.

639
00:44:55,794 --> 00:44:57,662
That's before we get
into your plasma,

640
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,030
your bone marrow.

641
00:44:59,064 --> 00:45:02,667
Even your skin bears a price.

642
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,170
You should have
valued yourself higher

643
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:07,305
before you broke
into this sacred place.

644
00:45:07,338 --> 00:45:10,141
-I didn't have a choice.
-Of course you had a choice.

645
00:45:10,175 --> 00:45:11,709
Just like he had a choice.

646
00:45:11,743 --> 00:45:13,611
You obviously know
this young man.

647
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:15,981
Caught earlier this morning...

648
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:20,886
..cutting another corner,
taking another shortcut.

649
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,622
Look, I know
what he did was wrong.

650
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:26,792
I get that. I'm pissed.

651
00:45:26,825 --> 00:45:30,161
But he...
he does not deserve...

652
00:45:30,195 --> 00:45:31,997
Of course he deserves it.

653
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:34,833
Who wouldn't vote
to end this wretch's life

654
00:45:34,866 --> 00:45:36,835
if it meant saving
a more worthy person,

655
00:45:36,868 --> 00:45:38,536
a person of value?

656
00:45:41,206 --> 00:45:43,608
You think life
is essentially fair?

657
00:45:46,211 --> 00:45:48,579
Well, unfortunately,
life is not fair.

658
00:45:48,613 --> 00:45:51,582
I know that life isn't fair.

659
00:45:51,616 --> 00:45:54,685
Hey, I know that!
I know that...

660
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:57,856
-[gasps] OK.
-And what is your excuse?

661
00:46:04,629 --> 00:46:06,264
My excuse?

662
00:46:07,398 --> 00:46:09,901
My excuse is that
the medical examiner,

663
00:46:09,935 --> 00:46:13,771
he determined my dad's
cause of death as suicide.

664
00:46:13,805 --> 00:46:17,008
But it wasn't suicide.
I know that it wasn't suicide.

665
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:19,744
He suffered from PTSD,
psychotic episodes

666
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,379
and he was heavily medicated.

667
00:46:21,412 --> 00:46:23,514
And then the insurance,
they cut off his medication...

668
00:46:23,548 --> 00:46:26,284
Ah, suicide cancelled
the insurance policy

669
00:46:26,317 --> 00:46:29,955
and you and Mommy
didn't get any money.

670
00:46:29,988 --> 00:46:31,556
Sad tale.

671
00:46:31,589 --> 00:46:33,058
A common one.

672
00:46:33,091 --> 00:46:34,860
-A victim's excuse.
-No.

673
00:46:34,893 --> 00:46:37,863
No, I am not
who you think I am, OK?

674
00:46:37,896 --> 00:46:39,297
I got into forensics

675
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:41,632
because I want to help people
find the truth, like...

676
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:45,703
The truth is what I say
the truth is.

677
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:48,439
Your father was a pathetic loser

678
00:46:48,473 --> 00:46:52,110
that did the world a favour
by ending his life.

679
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:55,981
And you, when you broke in here,
ended your life.

680
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:01,019
You are a sick man.

681
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,588
I'm not sick.

682
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:06,124
I'm the cure.

Please!

715
00:49:35,273 --> 00:49:36,541
No, please.

716

Please, I'm sorry!
Please!

Listen, listen, listen.

721
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:48,153
Not one word.

722
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:53,891
-Hi, sweetie.
-Hey, Dad.

723
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:55,760
Mom wants to know
if you're coming home tonight.

724
00:49:55,793 --> 00:49:59,097
Oh, no, honey, I can't make it.
Daddy's working.

725
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,931
Oh. We miss you.

726
00:50:00,965 --> 00:50:02,600
I miss you too.

727
00:50:02,633 --> 00:50:04,569
I'll see you
for breakfast tomorrow.

728
00:50:04,602 --> 00:50:06,804
Don't forget to call Brad
before school.

729
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,439
I won't.

730
00:50:08,473 --> 00:50:09,607
Love you.

I'm sorry. I'm... [stammers]

735
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:29,127
Thank you for that.

736
00:50:30,895 --> 00:50:34,199
Know that his death and yours

737
00:50:34,232 --> 00:50:37,135
will bring renewed life
to someone who's willing

738
00:50:37,168 --> 00:50:40,037
to sacrifice everything
for their beliefs

739
00:50:40,071 --> 00:50:41,839
and now, thanks to me,

740
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,875
your trivial existence
will have meaning.

741
00:50:44,909 --> 00:50:47,044

Just give me the fucking phone.

you should know a little more
about protocol procedure.

Can you hear me?

Up here.

834
01:04:54,558 --> 01:04:56,893
I assume TJ is your brother.

835
01:04:58,828 --> 01:05:01,031
Naughty little boy, isn't he?

836
01:05:01,065 --> 01:05:03,500
In literature,
they refer to him

837
01:05:03,533 --> 01:05:05,402
as an irredeemable character,

838
01:05:05,435 --> 01:05:07,037

01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:09,606
I'm sure you disagree.

I can tell
he's had his problems.

841
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:15,379
Probably renders him
sympathetic in your view.

842
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:17,481
But to me,
he's just a pile of dog shit

843
01:05:17,514 --> 01:05:18,915
on a pristine carpet

844
01:05:18,949 --> 01:05:20,250

holds the key

of his worthless life.

854

Chloe?

856
01:05:47,311 --> 01:05:49,913
They call them "June bugs".

857
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:52,349
Do you know why
they call them June bugs?

858
01:05:52,382 --> 01:05:55,252

-No, you don't worry about me.

leaving the state.

I am not asking you
right now, OK? I...

01:08:12,856 --> 01:08:15,592
Look, I couldn't save Mom.

894
01:08:16,693 --> 01:08:19,763

Where are they?

1107
01:20:53,282 --> 01:20:55,618
[sheriff] They went down there.

1108
01:20:55,651 --> 01:20:57,853
Keep 'em there
till we can drive them to us.

-No, we're trapped.
-Look at me.

There is going to be
a way out of here.

You need to trust me.

What's the deal?

1138
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:21,104
You're not gonna
let me in this time?

1139
01:22:22,105 --> 01:22:24,140
There's been a situation
with the liver.

1140
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:30,246
-I lost it.
-What?

1141
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:32,348
What the fuck, man?
That puts us down 100 grand.

1142
01:22:32,381 --> 01:22:34,883
I'm in the process
of replacing it.

1143
01:22:34,917 --> 01:22:37,053
I need you to come back
in an hour.

1144
01:22:38,887 --> 01:22:40,589
What the fuck
is up with your eye?

1145
01:22:42,891 --> 01:22:45,394
Why did you change
this shit up on me?

1146
01:22:45,428 --> 01:22:48,397
You know Mannix is
a creature of habit.

1147
01:22:48,431 --> 01:22:50,566
You're making me nervous.

1148
01:22:50,599 --> 01:22:53,736
I'm starting to sweat in places
you don't wanna hear about.

1149
01:22:57,673 --> 01:22:59,975
What the fuck?
Is that a cop car?

1150
01:23:00,009 --> 01:23:01,277
What if he sees me?

Oh, shit!
You sly motherfucker, you.

1153
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:12,155
You got a pig
working for you, don't you?

1154
01:23:12,188 --> 01:23:14,090
That's how you get
the live ones.

1155
01:23:14,123 --> 01:23:16,459
Me and Chase,
the pick-up guy in Lancaster,

1156
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:18,394
we was wondering about that.

1157
01:23:18,427 --> 01:23:22,565
Fuck, now I owe him 50 bucks.
I knew I smelled bacon.

1158
01:23:22,598 --> 01:23:24,300
So where is he?
Can I meet him?

1159
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:25,768
Or her. I'm down
with either one.

1160
01:23:25,801 --> 01:23:27,270
We're all part of the
same team, right?

1161
01:23:27,303 --> 01:23:28,804
It's... What?

1162
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:30,606
Ugh!

Oh, God. Who's shooting who?

1165
01:23:35,811 --> 01:23:38,747
It doesn't matter. OK.

1166
01:23:38,781 --> 01:23:40,149
Come on.

What?

1170
01:23:46,289 --> 01:23:48,491
You just cost us $100,000.

1171
01:23:48,524 --> 01:23:49,992
[sheriff] He had a big mouth.

1172
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,527
Shame we can't sell that.

1173
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:53,229

a pretty penny.

I see it, partner.

by some intruder.

The same punks
locked in the basement.

1199
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,632
They killed him, not us.

1200
01:25:36,665 --> 01:25:38,801
Can't we just hand over
his liver?

[screaming]

1202
01:25:46,442 --> 01:25:49,812
I don't think they'll accept
a liver with buckshot, do you?

1203
01:25:49,845 --> 01:25:53,882
OK. How about the ones
you keep in reserve downstairs?

1204
01:25:53,916 --> 01:25:56,719
Spare parts
from drunks, junkies.

1205

Kidneys are OK, eyes are good,

1206

How about yours?

Don't even joke.

1209
01:26:07,095 --> 01:26:08,997
You so much as raise
an eyebrow at me

1210
01:26:09,031 --> 01:26:11,634
and I will shoot you
in the fuckin' face.

1211

I have the item
you requested on hand.

Your man getting blindsided
is not my fault.

Misfortune is remedied
by ingenuity.

1235
01:27:40,889 --> 01:27:42,391
And money.
