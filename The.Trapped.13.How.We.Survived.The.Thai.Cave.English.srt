[intriguing music playing]

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,560
[reporter 1] It's a race against time
in Thailand

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,160
to save the young members
of a missing soccer team.

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,280
The boys, ranging in age 11 to 16,
have been feared dead

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,440
after they went missing
with their 24-year-old soccer coach.

6
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,400
[music continues]

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,920
[interviewer] There's no pressure. Okay?

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,920
[reporter 3] The fate
of a dozen youth soccer players

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,320
and their coach in Thailand
has captivated people around the world.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
[interviewer] You don't have to
answer any questions you don't want to.

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,840
There are no right or wrong answers.

12
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,600
[reporter 4] This is
the biggest international rescue attempt

13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,720
that's ever been staged.

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,080
There's help here from all over the world.

15
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,000
[water trickling]

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,880
[interviewer] It's important to us
that you feel comfortable.

17
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,760
-We can stop at any time.
-Okay.

18
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,080
[interviewer] Okay.

19
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,160
[reporter 5] It was a drama
the whole world watched unfold.

20
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,440
Stuck inside a flooded Thai cave
for 17 days.

21
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,520
[music continues]

22
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,200
[man] The outside world has no idea.

23
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,280
They probably have no idea at all
what it was actually like inside the cave.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,720
The truth might be different
from what they think.

25
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,800

[boy 1] Stay close, Titan.

28
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,280
That day, we had soccer practice.

00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,240
[dogs barking]

30
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,840
-[Titan in Thai] Help! There are dogs!
-[boy] Come on! Let's go!

31
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,400
[yelps]

32
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,880
[boy 3 laughing] Dummy.

33
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,400
[boy 1] There's a group of dogs. My bike!

34
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,120
[man] Let's go! [clapping]

35
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,760
[in English]
I'm Eakapol Jantawong, or Eak.

36
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,640
[Eak] One foot in!

37
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,240
A coach is a leader.

38
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,320
[in Thai] Shuffle, Tao.

39
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,680
[in English] You need discipline.

40
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,120
[in Thai] Look at your teammates.

41
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,880
[in English] You must love this job.

42
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,400
[in Thai] Look at your teammates.

43
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,360
Two passes only. Three touches max.

44
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,840
[whistle blows]

45
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,040
All right. Forward! Dom, come in.

46
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,680
-Tao, can you go forward?
-[boys laughing]

47
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,200
[boy] Let's go.

48
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,600
[Eak in English] Most kids
who go to school in this area

49
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,000
usually become thugs, drinkers or smokers.

50
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,040
We have the soccer team
to keep them away from drugs.

51
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,400
[in Thai] Go! Go!

52
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,800
[in English] In terms
of family background,

53
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,960
they mostly come from poor families.

54
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,640
[in Thai] Get in! Get in there.

55
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,720
[in English] I want to play
for the national team.

56
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,160
[Eak in Thai] Hey, defense.
Watch out for your opponents.

57
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,880
[in English] I like Man U.

58
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,480
Manchester United.

59
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,120
Man U.

60
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,920
[Eak in Thai] Finish it.

61
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,120
[in English] Coach Eak likes every play
to be practiced, so we work hard.

62
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,840
[Eak in Thai] Pass it, Mix!

63
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,480
[in English] I try to support these kids

64
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,240
so they can get a scholarship
at a high-level academy.

65
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,520
[in Thai] Let Tao finish it.

66
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,800
[all cheering]

67
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,880
[blowing whistle]

68
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,960
Break time.

69
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,640
[in English] At that time
I was 24 years old.

70
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,960
Off the field,
I was just their older brother.

71
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,520
[in Thai] Come on.

72
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,680
[in English] We're not related
but we're brothers.

73
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,840
We spend time together like a family.

74
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,960
Top North team versus Top South.

75
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,680
The Score is 2-0.

76
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,160
We were planning
to go to the cave after practice.

77
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,240
[adventurous music playing]

78
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,520
City kids go to the mall
in their free time,

79
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,080
but country kids only have the mountains
and the forests.

80
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,120
Tham Luang Cave
was the most exciting place.

81
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,360
I'd been many times.

82
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,360
After practice, we ate.

83
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,920
I remember I only had about ten sticks
of grilled pork and a kilo of rice.

84
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,400
[man in Thai] That's what they said.

85
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,880
[in English] I threw my leftovers away.

86
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,080
[boy 1 in Thai] Eat the sticky rice.

87
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,120
[boy 2] What is it?

88
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,520
[boy 1] It's sticky rice.

89
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,840
[clucking]

90
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,720
[Eak] Hurry and get ready.

91
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,040
-[boy 3] Let's go.
-[boys] Come on, let's go.

92
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,400
[in English] After eating,
we rode our bikes to Tham Luang Cave.

93
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,200
[Eak in Thai] Hurry up.

94
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,680
-[boy 3] Wait for me.
-[boy 5] I'm coming.

95
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,680
-[hip-hop music playing]
-[boy 6] Me too.

96
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,680
[boy 7] What?

97
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,080
[Eak] Follow me. Come on.

98
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,120
Let's go.

99
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,720
[boy 6] Don't do that, Tle.

100
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,880
[Eak in English] There was no rain.
It was hot and sunny.

101
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,720
[music continues]

102
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
[boys] Whoo-hoo!

103
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,080
-[boy 6 in Thai] Let's go, let's go!
-[boy 8] It's not that. It's…

104
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,320
[in English] Some were excited
for their first cave experience.

105
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,760
-[in Thai] Come on, let's go!
-Let's do this!

106
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,400
[Eak in English] We raced each other
as hard as we could.

107
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,320
[indistinct chatter]

108
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,680
[in English] I was always left behind.

109
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,080
I'm so tired.

110
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,680
Titan was the youngest in the group,
and everyone wanted to tease him.

111
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,640
There wasn't a single day
I didn't get teased.

112
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,560
Titan's strengths?

113
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,280
I can't think of any. [laughs]

114
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,360
[hip-hop music continues]

115
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,240
Titan and I are close.
We're like brothers.

116
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,040
[music continues]

117
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,200
We rode past orange groves.

118
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,400
[music continues]

119
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,880
[turns off music]

120
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,200
[Eak] Let's pray to Jao Mae.

121
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,280
[boy 1] Look over there.

122
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,480
[boy 2] Hurry.

123
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,240
[Eak] Let's go.

124
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,520
We saw the sign and we all said,
"We can't go inside."

125
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,640
I think the sign said, "There are
flash floods from July to November."

126
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,320
We went in the cave on June 23rd.

127
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,240
It wasn't even the rainy season yet.

128
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,720
Let's pray to Jao Mae Nangnon.

129
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,280
Jao Mae is the guardian of this place.

130
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,080
If we do something
without asking for her permission first,

131
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,880
something bad can happen.

132
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,680
[boy] There's a legend
about Jao Mae Nangnon.

133
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,080
She was a princess.

134
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,080
There was a horseman
who fell in love with the princess.

135
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,000
They ran away together.

136
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,320
[horses galloping]

137
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,760
-Soldiers chased them.
-[horse neighing]

138
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,480
The horseman went to look for food.

139
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,640
[man shouting]

140
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,400
[boy] The soldiers killed him.

141
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,920
The princess waited,
but he never came back,

142
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,520
so she used her hairpin to kill herself.

143
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,840
The mountains look like the princess.

144
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,920
[somber music playing]

145
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,360
-[Eak in Thai] Let's get the bikes.
-[boy 1] Let's go into the cave.

146
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,760
[boy 2] Come on.

147
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,320
-[boy 3] Wow.
-[boy 4] I see.

148
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,880
[Eak in English] When we arrived
at the cave entrance,

149
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,800
the kids were excited and they were like,
"Wow! It's this big?"

150
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,680
[in Thai] Hurry up.

151
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,880
[in English] Guys,
pray before you enter the cave.

152
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,120
We'd usually leave everything behind.

153
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,360
[Eak in Thai] Let's go.

154
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
[indistinct chatter]

155
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,480
[pensive music playing]

156
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,560
[in English] We didn't bring food.
We only had flashlights when we entered.

157
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,640
[music continues]

158
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,040
[Eak] I had Tee lead the way
and I was the last one inside.

159
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,480
Tee was like my special assistant.

160
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,840
I felt more at ease
when I had Tee with me.

161
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,480
Because at the very least, with Tee there,

162
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,880
he could help take care
of the rest of the kids.

163
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,000
[indistinct chatter]

164
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,360
[in Thai] Let's go.

165
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,960
[Tee in English] I had been inside before.

166
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,560
So I was confident.
I wanted to take the boys there.

167
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,640
[music continues]

168
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,960
We were only supposed to stay for an hour.
I had a tutoring session.

169
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,920
[indistinct chatter]

170
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,880

00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,520
[boys howling]

173
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,400
[indistinct chatter]

174
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,560
[boy in Thai] Wow, look at that!

175
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,240
We were messing around.

176
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,320
[all cheering]

177
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,640
[boy] We were teasing Tee
because he had a girlfriend,

178
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,680
joking that they take pictures together
and hold hands.

179
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,880
[all cheering]

180
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,440
[boy] Let's go, let's go.

181
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,920
[Eak] They were joking around
the whole way.

182
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,560
When I saw that. I was happy.

183
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,880
[boy 1 in Thai] There are more places
to hide ahead?

184
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,800
[boy 2] Yes, there are.

185
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,760
[boy 3] You know you can't go in there.

186
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,280
[intense music playing]

187
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,520
[Eak in English]
When we arrived at the T-junction,

188
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,360
we couldn't go
further than a few meters to the right.

189
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,480
We had to take a left to go further.

190
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,560
[music continues]

191
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,600
[boy] I think I was scared
when we got to the T-junction.

192
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,920
There was a stream of water.

193
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,880
I was afraid it would flood
and we couldn't get out.

194
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,080
No matter what season it is,

195
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,680
there's always water there.
It's never dry.

196
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,640
[Mix] I said,
"A lot of water is pouring in.

197
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,640
Should we go back? We're far enough."

198
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,400
They said, "Go back by yourself
if you want to. What, are you scared?"

199
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,080
[indistinct chatter]

200
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,160
I let everyone decide for themselves.

201
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,920
If they chose not to keep going,
we'd all go back.

202
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,760
We voted. It's more beautiful further in.

203
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,760
-[boy 1] Let's go. Let's go now.
-[boy 2] Let's go.

204
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,480
[Mix] They said, "Let's keep going."

205
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,040
But I was thinking how I wanted to leave.

206
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,760
[Eak in Thai] Follow me, follow me.

207
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,000
[boy] Let's go inside.

208
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,040
[Mix in English]
We left our bags and shoes.

209
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,640
We were afraid they'd get wet.

210
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,000
We kept going with only our flashlights.

211
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,840
[indistinct chatter]

212
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,320
[Tee in Thai] Hey, wait for me.

213
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,800
[thunder rumbling]

214
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,360
[man in English] I've been working
at Tham Luang-Khun Nam Nang Non

215
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,240
for about two years.

216
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,840
In the evening,
I have to check if anyone is still inside.

217
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,920
[thunder rumbling]

218
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,160
It usually starts raining in July.

219
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,360
It was June.
How can it start raining in June?

220
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,040
From the entrance,
the length of Tham Luang Cave

221
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,080
is 10 kilometers and 316 meters.

222
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,920
When the rainy season starts,
the water flows from the peak.

223
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,880
The water flows down from every direction.
It's full of holes inside.

224
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,000
I counted eleven bikes.

225
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,600
At first, I thought they were adults.

226
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,840
If you enter without the staff knowing,

227
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,760
you could be stuck all night.
I mean, who'd know?

228
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,040
[thunder rumbling]

229
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,120
[indistinct chatter]

230
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,840
[Tee] As we went further,
it got more beautiful, so we kept going.

231
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,480
[Eak] There was like an aura drawing us.

232
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,160
I wanted them to see something beautiful.

233
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,240
[gentle music playing]

234
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,600
I thought I could take them
to learn something new.

235
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,080
[boy] It was very beautiful.

236
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,280
It was like diamond dust, just amazing.

237
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,680
There was a big chamber.

238
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,760
[music continues]

239
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,160
Titan had to leave
before five o'clock for his class.

240
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,840
I said, "Guys, let's go back.
Time's up. We'll come again."

241
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,840
Let's go.

242
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,640
-[water trickling]
-[boy laughing]

243
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,640
[Eak] So we started to wade back.

244
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,840
While we headed back,
we were just chatting like normal.

245
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,000
Until the T-junction.

246
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,760
At the T-junction, I thought…

247
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,280
It was one way in and out.

248
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,480
"Is this right?" Eak said yes.

249
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,840
[Eak] The water flooded the T-junction.

250
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,080
It was covered entirely,
and we couldn't go forward.

251
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,160
At that moment, I suddenly thought,
"Oh no. "We're in a big mess."

252
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,400
We were in shock.

253
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,160
So I said,
"Let's find a way to get out of here."

254
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,560
I was going to check another way.

255
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,360
I decided to dive.

256
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,440
[tense music playing]

257
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,800
I felt anxious.
I didn't know if Eak would find a way out.

258
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,160
[tense music continues]

259
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,920
[Eak] I opened my eyes,
but I couldn't see anything.

260
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,200
I tried to dig.

261
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,680
[digging]

262
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,440
I couldn't make it through.

263
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,800
I was about to run out of breath.

264
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,800
[water sloshing]

265
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,280
I thought I was dying.

266
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,240
At that moment, I shook the rope.

267
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,440
[boys in Thai] One, two…

268
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,200
[Eak in English] The boys pulled it.

269
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,960
[boy in Thai] One more time.

270
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,160
[in English]
I had completely run out of air.

271
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,640
[boys in Thai] Two. Again.

272
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,040
One, two. One, two.

273
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,880
[indistinct chatter]

274
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,920
[in English] I told the kids
it's a dead end.

275
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,280
When Eak said that, I got quiet.
I didn't know what to do.

276
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,520
[Phet calling]

277
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,160
Anybody here?

278
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,120
It was around five or six o'clock,
and they were still inside.

279
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,680
My boss sent out two more staff
to help the search.

280
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,120
[ranger 1] Where are you?

281
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,600
[ranger 2] Anybody there?

00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,200
[rangers calling]

283
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,240
[Phet] We walked from the first chamber
to the second chamber.

284
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,600
We yelled out, but we couldn't find them.

285
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,120
[rangers calling]

286
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,840
There was already a lot of water.

287
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,120
[ranger 2 in Thai] Anyone there?

288
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,480
[Phet in English] They weren't in
the third chamber either.

289
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,480
I hoped we'd find them at the T-Junction.

290
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,720
[ranger 2] Is anybody here?

291
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,040
[Phet] When I got there,
I found their bags and shoes.

292
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,680
I looked around
until I found their phones.

293
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,760
At that moment, my heart sank.
They're kids.

294
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,360
[ranger 1 calling]

295
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,520
[in Thai] Anyone hear me?

296
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,960
[calling] Can anyone hear us?

297
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,480
[Phet in English]
The cave was full of water.

298
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,080
At that point I thought,
"Man, what do I do?"

299
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,080
"How can I get these kids out?"

300
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,440
Hello!

301
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,000
I said: "Let's get out and call for help."

302
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,160
[tense music playing]

303
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,440
[water sloshing]

304
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,840
[Eak] When I saw the water level rising,

305
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,480
I had to do whatever I could
to keep the kids calm.

306
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,720
So I tried to act as normal as possible.

307
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,320
I told them, "Maybe it's just the tides."

308
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,960
I thought the water level would drop.

309
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,800
So I said,
"Let's go find somewhere to sleep."

310
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,040
"We'll come back and check tomorrow.
When it drops, we'll get out."

311
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,960
[in Thai] Two, three, yeah.

312
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,520
[Titan in English]
We tried to stay positive.

313
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,680
[indistinct chatter]

314
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,320
I had missed my session. So I thought,
"Perfect. I don't have to go to my tutor."

315
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,120
[chuckles]

316
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,720
[Eak] No one was panicking

317
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,680
because it was like we were
just going to sleep in a new place.

318
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,120
We're having an adventure,
something like that.

319
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,200
[indistinct chatter]

320
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,840
That night, I was only afraid
of my parents scolding me.

321
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,760
Some of us hadn't even told our parents
where we were going.

322
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,200
I thought my parents
would probably look for me

323
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,240
and try to find out where I went.

324
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,880
[crickets chirping]

325
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,040
[woman] I worry about Tee when he goes out
or goes somewhere with friends.

326
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,520
I kept waiting, but he never came back.

327
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,800
I was concerned
Tee had gotten into a fight with someone.

328
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,320
A kid from his school came and told me,
"Tee is stuck in the cave."

329
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,400
[contemplative music playing]

330
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,320
The first time my husband took me there,
I was scared.

331
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,280
When I went inside the cave
and I saw people…

332
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,480
-[man 1 in Thai] Go down to the ridge.
-[whistle blows]

333
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,440
[man 2] Let me help.

334
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,440
[woman 2 in English]
Shoes were left at the front.

335
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,280
No one had moved anything.

336
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,040
His bicycle was there,
his bag and belongings.

337
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,640
I was so shocked.

338
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,360
[indistinct chatter]

339
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,000
[man] The atmosphere
at the entrance was eerie.

340
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,680
I felt terrible after, I was breathless.

341
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,960
I didn't know what to do but pray
to our sacred beings to protect my son.

342
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,000
I had no idea he was going to the cave.

343
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,520
In the morning he only said that
he was going to play in a soccer match.

344
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,800
He said nothing about going to the cave.

345
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,960
People came to ask me questions,
but I kept crying.

346
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,880
I couldn't answer them
because I was so sad.

347
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,960

[shivering]

349
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,680
[boy] The first night
I slept with the flashlight on.

350
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,440
If it got completely dark,
everyone would get scared.

351
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,680
[shivering]

352
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,880
[Titan] We slept next to each other,

353
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,280
and held one another.

354
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,680
[Tee] It felt as cold as ice,
we could feel the frostbite.

355
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,040
[exhaling]

356
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,160
I could only hear the sound of our breath
and my own heart beating.

357
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,200
It went…

358

[imitates heart beating]

[water dripping]

362
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,280
[Eak] The first night,
what I was worried about

363
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,680
was whether or not
we would be able to get out.

364
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,160
I had to take care of these 12 lives
without knowing what would happen next.

365
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,240
[heart beating]

366
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,320
[newscaster] Our first story is
an incident that happened last night.

367
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,960
A Thai cave is flooded and 13 are trapped.

368
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,080
DUO NEWS

369
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,040
Right. Even rescue workers
haven't been able to get to them.

370
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,280
Okay, count off.

371
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,200
-One.
-Two.

372
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,120
-Three.
-Four.

-Five.
-Six.

374
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,840
As of now, we have sent eight teams.

375
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,680
In terms of headcount,
that's almost 50 officers.

376
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,840
They're carrying diving gear and food.

377
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,920
[suspenseful music playing]

378
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,680
At the time, there were very few of us
who knew their way around Tham Luang Cave,

379
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,640
especially those of us
known as cave explorers.

381
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,320
I happened to have
prior knowledge of the cave.

382
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,120
The first time I went to help,
I saw all the water at the T-junction.

383
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,760
We started our rescue mission
with equipment.

384
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,440
Water pumps, ropes,
things we could find around the area.

385
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,520
[motor whirring]

386
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,000
Now it's up to the water pumps
to clear out the path.

387
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,600
We were fighting massive amounts of water
with limited equipment.

388
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,200
The technology we had wasn't enough
to pump the water out.

389
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,280
[motor whirring]

390
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,880
-[thunder rumbling]
-[rain pattering]

391
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,360
Once it starts raining, it won't let up.

392
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:54,200
I thought, "If it rains heavily, the water
will flood in and fill up everything."

393
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,680
"We probably won't find them
by that point."

394
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,360
If we don't get any more rain,
and the water level drops,

395
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,360
we might be able to pump more out.

396
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,800
That would be good news.

397
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,200
I was glad the governor was there.
He said he would keep us informed.

398
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,280
Every one or two hours,
he'd give us an update

399
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,520
My only hope is that they're doing well
and there will be no more rain.

400
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,800
We were against time and nature.

00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,520
[officer 1]
Oh, the water is rising, see that?

402
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,520
[officer 2] I see.

403
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,640
[officer 1] Yesterday,
the water wasn't this high.

404
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,280
It's rising quickly

405
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,520
-[officer 2] It's getting higher.
-[officer 1] Yeah.

406
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,920
[Kamon] We had to work faster

407
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,200
because more water
was coming in from the back.

408
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,440
It was also very difficult

409
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,920
because the water was coming
from two channels that would meet

410
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,840
and surge towards the cave entrance.

411
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,600
That's what was troubling.

412
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,680
[tense music playing]

413
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,240
[Titan] When we woke up, there was water.

414
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,800
When I turned back around,
the water almost got to me

415
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,240
It was quick.
It kept coming. It kept following us.

416
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,280
[Eak] We had to solve the problem.

417
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,320
So we gathered
and discussed what to do next.

418
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,760
"Do we go forward?"

419
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,560
I told the boys
to use the flashlights sparingly.

[suspenseful music playing]

421
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,320

[music continues]

423
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,480
Some of the kids started complaining,

424
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,840
"What are the rescue workers even doing?
Why haven't they come looking for us?"

425
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,240
[indistinct chatter]

426
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,800
We need more people.

427

[man in Thai] Seventeen.

428
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,720
[reporter in English]
How long before they're really in danger?

429
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:34,280
Uh, I… I cannot expect how long,
but every minute is important.

430
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,160
[tense music playing]

431
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,360
[woman 1 in Thai] Slowly. Be careful.

432
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,080
[Ei Khan in English] Titan, sweetie,
I'm waiting here to take you home.

433
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,960
[Biw's mom] Let's go home, son.
Come on, let's go home, Biw!

434
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,480
At that moment,
I felt like I had to call out to Titan.

435
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,240
I thought if he could hear me,

436
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,680
he would at least know
that I was waiting there.

437
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,240
[sniffling]

438
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,160
I would go to work
and get off around 8:00 or 9:00 p.m.

439
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,520
So during that time,
he was really close with Eak.

440
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,400
[indistinct chatter]

441
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,760
At the time, I could only think about
how much Titan looked up to Eak.

442
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,720
I said to myself,

443
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,480
"You must get Titan out, Eak.
I know you can do it."

444
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,920
Jao Mae,
please give our boys the strength.

445
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,760
Frantic search for 12 boys
and their football coach.

446
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,280
And desperate families
are waiting nervously for news.

447
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,600
[man] It was still
quite a local story at that time.

448
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,640
I didn't think
it would turn into anything.

449
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,240
And I honestly thought at that stage,

450
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,400
"Well, that's... that's 13 dead people."

451
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,560
But I remember
our news director was very, very keen.

452
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,320
He said,
"This is going to be a huge story.

453
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,160
Different units
have been coming here frequently

454
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,440
to provide us with important support.

455
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,720
There were all sorts of people
who came to help.

456
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,840
From doctors and nurses, to soldiers.

457
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,480
It was like the forces
of the whole country were there.

458
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,360
That was what I was most impressed with.

459
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,840
[Narongsak]
We have a patrol unit searching

460
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,960
for any other possible exit routes.

461
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,440
The Border Patrol will fly a helicopter

462
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,720
to check and see if there are
any other entrances to the cave.

463
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:52,440
Different local forestry forces
along with part of the military forces,

464
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,600
will patrol the area to find entry points

465
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,720
where water can flood in,
in order to block them.

466
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,520
The SEALs will fly in directly
from Sattahip at midnight.

467
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,480
I was the commander
of the Naval Special Warfare Command,

468

for the Royal Thai Fleet.

00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,640
We were racing against time
and rising water levels.

470
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,080
[SEAL] Watch your feet.

471
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,400
[officer] A bit more, one, two.

472
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,400
We had to pump the water out

473
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,640
so the SEALs could find the kids
as quickly as possible.

474
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,200
[indistinct chatter]

475
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,560
[Apakorn] The SEALs are skilled divers.

476
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,680
When they first arrived,

477
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,800
they tried to dive through
and away from the T-junction.

478
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,680
As the water got higher,
we couldn't go further.

479
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,560
[water dripping]

480
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,120
[alarm beeping]

481
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,400
[Eak] Tee's alarm rang at 6:00
every morning.

482
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,680
We would have been more stressed out
if we didn't know the time.

483
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,080
We would have lived each day
without having any plan at all.

484
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,440
I organized the day as I would
under normal circumstances.

485
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,280
From morning until evening,
we would look for a way out.

486
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,040
Coach Eak told us,
"There's definitely a way out."

487
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,080
And we tried to find one every single day.

488
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,360
[gentle music playing]

489
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,400
I was trying to fight off
mental weakness in myself.

490
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,240
[indistinct chatter]

491
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,160
[Titan] We walked until we got tired.

492
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,360
It was around evening.

493
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,880
The only thing I could think about
was that I was hungry.

494
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,480
[boy in Thai] You want to give up?

495
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,760
[in English] I was so hungry,
and everyone kept talking about food.

496
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,880
That was aggravating.
It was freaking torture.

497
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,560
I imagined food in my head
and I wanted to eat everything.

498
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,640
"I want to order KFC.
Will they deliver to us here?"

499
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,800
[inhales] We couldn't stop thinking
about food.

500
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:57,880
[chuckles] One guy dreamed about
drinking his favorite brand of milk.

501
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,880
He was drinking the milk in his dream.

502
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:06,080
When he woke up, he found himself
with Adul's toe in his mouth.

503
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,880
[male voice in Thai] Pork skewers.

504
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:15,560
[Titan in English] I thought about when we
were eating at the soccer field at noon.

505
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,080
That was my biggest regret.

506
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,600
I ate very little.
I should have eaten a lot.

507
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,880
[indistinct chatter]

508
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,960
[solemn music playing]

509
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,080
I dreamed about a meal with my family.

510
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,160
[music continues]

511
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,280
I hoped that I would get to eat
my mother's cooking again.

512
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:48,240
We didn't have a lot of money.
My mother mostly cooked simple dishes.

513
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,320
[solemn music continues]

514
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,600
I missed my mom's cabbage curry.

515
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,080
I really wanted her cooking.

516
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,480
[water trickling]

517
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,000
[Eak] The only thing I could
tell them was, "Keep drinking water."

518
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,840
We had to do whatever we could to survive.

519
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,520
[Tee] Drinking water helped a little.
But we were still hungry.

520
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:52,160
Then I was starting to get very tired.
I had no energy.

521
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,000
I felt dizzy.
I immediately fell when I got up.

522
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,440
I had to protect these guys.
I couldn't let anything happen to them.

523
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,360
My parents passed when I was young.

524
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,160
In order to lighten the burden
on my relatives,

525
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,280
I had to be ordained into monkhood.

526
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,040
I was ordained for over ten years.

527
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,360
Being ordained as a novice monk

528
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,560
has made me a stronger person
mentally and physically.

529
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,320
If your mind is weak,
your body will be weak.

530
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,560
If your mind is strong,
your body will be strong.

531
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,320
Before we went to sleep, we would pray
and ask holy spirits for blessings.

532
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,280
We just asked Jao Mae Nangnon
to help us with a miracle.

533
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,280
We meditated to calm down.

534
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,720
To be with ourselves,
and not lose our focus.

535
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:08,120
We thought, even if no one is coming
to save us, don't panic, just stay calm.

536
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,160
[breathing deeply]

537
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,320
I took a breath
and prayed that we would make it.

538
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,280
[water dripping]

539
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,360
[breathing deeply]

540
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,720
[thunder rumbling]

541
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,800
[rain pattering]

542
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,880
It's raining heavily.

543
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,960
THAIRATH MORNING NEWS

544
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,880
The entire ground of the national park
has turned into mud.

545
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,320
RESCUE MISSION FOR 13 LIVES, DAY 4

546
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,360
It's currently quite difficult for
our rescue teams to carry out their work.

547
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,920
[reporter]
How survivable is it inside there?

548
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,160
Depends where they are.

549
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,240
[reporter] Right. And what do you know
of these types of caves?

550
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,840
This system,
if they're… if they're in the right place,

551
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,600
they could survive for five, six days.

552
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,360
But the water now, the… the, uh...

553
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,920
the flood water
is… is getting higher and higher.

554
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
[water gushing]

555
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,880
I do have hope.

556
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,040
I want all 13 of them
to make it out safely.

557
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,120
[all chanting]

558
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,440
They told us to go to various places
to pray for the rain to stop.

559
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,640
Pray to the guardian spirits
at Tham Luang Cave

560
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,320
so that they could get the kids out.

561
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,400
[gentle music playing]

562
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,960
Mark is a small boy.

563
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,400
He's afraid of the dark.

564
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,880
The two of us have struggled
since he was little

565
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,960
because Mark's father and I divorced
when Mark was about a year old.

566
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,760
I didn't know
if my child was going to survive.

567
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,520
[sobbing]

568
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,840
It was too much for me,

569
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,400
so I fainted.

570
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,120
I couldn't control myself.

571
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,920
[in Thai] Are you feeling better?
Here, this is ammonia.

572
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,800
-Massage her.
-She has regained consciousness.

573
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,760
[water trickling]

574
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,840
[tense music playing]

575
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,960
[in English]
The water kept getting higher,

576
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,520
so we went further in
to try to find a way out.

577
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,920
[Tee] We reached
the farthest point we could go.

578
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,000
[Mix] We just couldn't find a way out.
There was only darkness.

579
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,600
I couldn't take it anymore.

580
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,920
I wanted to see the light.

581
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,280
[Tee] One of the boys shouted out,

582
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:06,280
"I can't take it anymore.
I'm tired. I want to go home.

583
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:10,880
[Tee in Thai]
Hey, we're going to make it. Trust me.

584
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,800
[Eak in English]
With all the stress piling on

585
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,760
and hunger on top of that,
it was getting harder to cope.

586
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,840
[indistinct chatter]

587
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,400
Everyone blamed themselves.

588
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,440
We all thought, "We shouldn't have come."

589
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,760
Eak said,
"If anyone wants to cry, let it all out."

590
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,760
I wanted to see my parents. I was hungry.

591
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,440
We told each other
that we loved each other.

592
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:48,120
At that time I was so stressed out.

593
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,360
I didn't think we'd make it.

594
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:59,280
I would tell them, "No matter
what happens, we must never fight."

595
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,320
"We must always help each other out."

596
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,640
I think it got quiet for five minutes.

597
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,720
Then I started hearing
the sound of a helicopter.

598
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,200
Like it was flying over.

599
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,840
[imitating helicopter hovering]

600
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,320
-[boy 1] Hurry!
-[boy 2] Help us!

601
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,160
I heard what sounded like someone
drilling, or digging into something.

602
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,440
We're going to make it.

603
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,680
[Eak] Stop. Stop.

604
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,880
Everyone was excited.

605
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,200
We were hopeful again.

606
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,280
We had lost hope earlier
and we got it back.

607
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,120
[in Thai] Hello! Please help us!

608
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,800
[in English]
Is someone coming to rescue us?

609
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,080
Please help us!

610
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,680
We tried to find where it was coming from,
see if it was a person.

611
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,960
[water gushing]

612
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,320
Suddenly, I heard what sounded like water.
I heard the water gushing in.

613
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,880
So I tried to look.
Then I saw this black thing, like a wave.

614
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,120
[water gushing]

615
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,920
[man yelling]

616
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,520
It was like a flash flood.

617
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,560
When I saw that,
I told everyone to get to a higher place.

618
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,120
[all clamoring]

619
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,200
Everyone ran up, pushing each other.

620
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,120
[all shouting]

621
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,560
If Eak hadn't jumped,
he would've been swept away by the water.

622
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,640
[all shouting]

623
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,760
It was so loud.

624
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,360
Then it got quiet.

625
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,480
The water got still.

626
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,120
[water flowing]

627
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,840
We were at the highest point in the cave.

628
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,360
We couldn't find a way out.
The entrance was completely flooded.

629
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,440
[somber music playing]

630
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,920
[water sloshing]

631
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,760
[Apakorn] The water was flooding the cave.

632
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,080
It was crashing into the walls.

633
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,280
[imitating water crashing]

634
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,320
The water was surging towards us.

635
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,440
I had never seen it before.

636
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,560
We had to retreat.

637
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,560
We had to go back
and start from square one.

638
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,160
It was depressing.

639
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,520
[Eak] We were trapped on both sides.

640
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:05,200
[Adul] We had no options left.
That meant we had to stay.

641
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,880
We couldn't go anywhere else.

642
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,080
We just hoped
that the water would stop there.

643
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,640
Hmm.

644
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,160
[water gushing]

645
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,640
[Tle] I thought about how we would die.
We would probably die drowning.

646
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,920
That's what I thought.

647
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,400
I worried about my mother.

648
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,240
She'd already lost one child.
I didn't want her to lose another one.

649
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,720
[Saksipong] Tle is a sensitive child.

650
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,080
As an only child,
he was the center of attention.

651
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,160
I have to hold him when he sleeps.

652
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,360
We sleep in the same bed, the three of us.

653
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,040
I blamed it on my luck.

654
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,160
I must have bad karma

655
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,040
because I didn't get to
raise my first child either.

656
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,840
If I lose this one too, I couldn't live.

657
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,840
[water dripping]

658
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,640
I did blame myself.

659
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:41,680
I was the one who brought them there.
I had to take responsibility.

660
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,960
I wouldn't want anyone to experience loss.

661
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,720
Experiencing loss
was something very painful for me.

662
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,200
When I was six years old,
my younger brother died.

663
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,880
Then, my mother,
who couldn't cope with the loss,

664
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,240
also passed away.

665
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,920
And not long after,

666
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,040
my father started falling ill
and he died too.

667
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,200
If one of them,
if any of them didn't make it out alive,

668
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,520
I wouldn't be able to face…

669
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,840
to look their families in the eye.

670
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,840
I wouldn't be able to confront them
and tell them how...

671
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,320
I brought their boys into the cave to die.

672
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,640
[somber music playing]

673
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,560
[water dripping]

674
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,440
[tense music playing]

675
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,880
We had nowhere else to go.

676
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,200
The only way to go was up,
and dig our way out.

677
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:13,720
[tense music continues]

678
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,320
We had no idea how thick it was.

679
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,880
"Help each other dig.
We'll get through." I told them.

680
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,360
We would take turns digging.

681
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,720
Without giving them something to do,

682
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,640
I thought that they would just sit around
talking or start thinking too much.

683
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,720
Then they would start
getting on each other's nerves.

684
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,080
We had to help each other.

685
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,960
-Let's help each other.
-[boy] Come on. Move that. [grunts]

686
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,160
Come help me.

687
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,640
We had to work together.

688
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,560
It was teamwork
just like when we played soccer together.

689
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,520
We can't play soccer alone, can we?

690
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,320
All of us have to play together.

691
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,680
[grunting]

692
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,440
We win and lose together.

693
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,200
[grunting]

694
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,800
-[Eak in Thai] Hey, slow down.
-[boy] Go forward.

695
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,960
[in English] The kids asked me,
"How far do you think it is?"

696
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:20,320
I said, "Five meters."

697
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,000
Everyone believed that.

698
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,680
[Eak] We imagined
that we'd turn up in the orange groves.

699
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31,720
-[ethereal music playing]
-[birds chirping]

700
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:36,240
[indistinct chatter and laughter]

701
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,960
[Tle] If we made it out
we would eat other people's oranges.

702
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,880
Would they yell at us?
Would the owners kick us out?

703
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,720
We came up with a whole plan.
We just used our imagination.

704
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:19,080
Once we got out,
we would go down from the orange groves.

705
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,600
There would be a small shop
where we would buy something to eat.

706
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:26,560
Then, we would go to the cave entrance
and get our bikes and head home.

707
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,640
-[ethereal music playing]
-[laughing]

708
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,240
[suspenseful music playing]

709
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,720
[boy in Thai]
We have to make it outta here.

710
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,480
[Eak in English] So we kept on digging.

711
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,080
Some started wishing
for an asteroid to hit Earth.

712
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,400
-[explosion]
-[Eak imitates explosion]

713
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,840
After the hit, we could get out.

714
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,840
[panting]

715
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:05,240
The boys played around, teased each other,
made jokes, that helped them quite a bit.

716
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:11,880
[Tee] We joked about "If a naked woman
walked in here, what would you do?"

717
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:18,840
Adul said, "That's good.
I'm tired. We'll make her dig." [chuckles]

718
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,640
Everyone burst out laughing.
No one was expecting that.

719
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,840
Many funny things happened back then,
but we weren't in the mood to laugh.

720
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,000
We were tense.

721
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,000
[grunting]

722
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,000
[Titan] It was like our last hope.
It was the only way.

723
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,280
[thunder rumbling]

724
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,280
[James] I could just
really feel the interest

725
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,400
in what was happening
day after day after day.

726
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,880
In time, it became like a mini village
in the middle of the jungle

727
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,160
where there were
hundreds and hundreds of people.

728
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:07,400
It became a huge global phenomenon.

729
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,840
The fate of a dozen youth soccer players

730
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,240
and their coach in Thailand
has captivated people around the world.

731
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,520
Twelve youth soccer players
and their coach

732
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,320
have been reported missing in a cave.

733
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,120
Has anyone said
how long this group can survive?

734
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,400
They just don't know.

735
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,720
Rescuers have been
working around the clock

736
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,680
pumping thousands of gallons of water
out of that cave

737
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:31,600
so they can get better access
and find the group inside.

738
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,360
I remember, we got there.

739
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,400
I think most people just thought
they'd be gone.

740
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:38,960
I think that was really what it was.
Like, surely, they can't be alive.

741
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,840
But what was happening in those early days

742
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,680
was that they were trying
to pump the water out.

743
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,640
And then they'd send in the Navy SEALs.

744
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:49,480
But, basically, the current
was so strong, they just couldn't get in.

745
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,880
And that's when
they asked for international help.

746
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,480
Yesterday, we said every minute counts.

747
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,120
Today, every half a minute,

748
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,480
every ten seconds
all count to save the boys' lives.

749
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,680
But we are still unable
to fight against the water.

750
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,400
Today we have experts on site

751
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,440
who have years of experience
cave diving around the world.

752
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:20,160
[Apakorn] There were many moving parts
for this mission.

753
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:24,120
I think there were around 8,000 people.

754
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,040
There were divers
from the US, Australia, and China.

755
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,120
[man] So, there's this group
of volunteer cave divers.

756
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:40,240
A very… kind of desperate bunch
of oddballs from all around the world.

757
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,640
So, very early on, I just said,

758
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,320
"Look, if there's anything
we can do from Australia

759
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:51,080
with manpower
or… or phone advice or anything,

760
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:54,400
uh, just let us know,
and I can help facilitate that."

761
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,840
But we asked and nothing happened…

762
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:01,360
[Richard] Rick Stanton and John Volanthen
are two very well-known cave divers

763
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,920
at the elite level in this sport.

764
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:09,280
My dialogue with Rick had started
a few days before we actually left

765
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,960
to go over to Thailand.

766
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:16,320
The description of the cave from Rick
and John was that it was fully in flood.

767
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,360
The cave was essentially impenetrable
by the divers.

768
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,440
[thrilling music playing]

769
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,600
The Thai Navy SEALs and Ben Reymenants
and one of Ben's dive buddies

770
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:34,600
were involved
in laying some lines early on in the cave.

771
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:41,040
But the information we were receiving
from a few people like Ben on the ground

772
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,280
was that the conditions were really dire.

773
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,080
[Ben] Make no mistake.

774
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,920
In a normal situation,
I would have never jumped in there.

775
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,120
Out of the question.

776
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,160
[water sloshing]

777
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,560
Strong currents and zero visibility.
I was really not very hopeful.

778
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,880
[Apakorn] The cave was complex.
It was dark.

779
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,840
We had to lay the line.
The first team went in.

780
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,520
They laid the ropes as they went.

781
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,600
They came back when they reached the end.

782
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:22,240
And the next team would go in,
and continue laying the lines.

783
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,560
Rotating around the clock,
the British divers, they were laying rope.

784
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:31,480
Then the Navy SEALs, then us,
and rotating, literally, around the clock.

785
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:39,080
We had to get in there.
We needed to find the kids.

786
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,520
We had to rescue the boys.

787
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,840
[water flowing]

788
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,480
[Eak] The fifth, sixth,
and seventh day were all the same.

[curious music playing]

790
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,800
[boy] What's up with the light?

791
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,080
[Titan] Our flashlights were about to die.

792
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,240
We were worried we wouldn't be able
to do anything without them.

793
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,280
[Tle] We kept digging.

794
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,120
All we did was dig, sit,
and drink water, that's it.

795
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,360
If we stayed still, we would lose hope.

796
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,760
If we kept digging,
we might have a chance.

797
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,320
[indistinct chatter]

798
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,960
[kids chatter in distance]

799
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,680
As we were digging, we all heard sounds.

800
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,920
I heard kids playing and crying.

801
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,720
-[kids chattering]
-[rooster crowing]

802
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:55,120
I heard a rooster crow.
And some of the boys heard dogs.

803
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:56,840
[dog barking]

804
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:01,800
We had no idea where they came from,
but we heard them.

805
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,520
Our brains were foggy.

806
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,040
[in Thai] You okay?

807
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,560
Hey. Come on.

808
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,960
[Eak in English]
If anyone was feeling down,

809
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,840
they would help cheer each other up.

810
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,480
[emotional music playing]

811
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:28,440
I'd tell them, "Someone is coming
to rescue us. We are going to survive."

812
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,040
"We're not going to die here."

813
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,400
Tee consoled us, gave us hope.

814
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,960
I had to make sure they would survive.

815
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:42,760
I brought them in here,
so I had to get them out.

816
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,840
[water dripping, flowing]

817
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,720
I missed my mother and family.

818
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,040
They slept in my arms,
next to me on both sides.

819
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,120
[emotional music continues]

820
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,920
We held each other as we slept.

821
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,840
It was like hugging my family.
It felt good.

822
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,160
[thunder rumbling]

823

[indistinct chatter]

824
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,640
I couldn't sleep.

825
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:42,880
So I asked my husband,
"What are we going to do if he dies?"

826
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,120
I wasn't able to eat for about five days.

827
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,920
I'm worried about my son.
I wonder what he's doing in there.

828
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:58,200
-[reporter] How have you been doing?
-I've been so stressed out.

829
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,240
[reporter]
What do you want to tell your son?

830
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,080
I want to see him.

831
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,080
I didn't want to sleep.

832
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:11,200
They wanted me to,
so they tried to give me sleeping pills.

833
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,920
I didn't take them.

834
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
I was afraid that if my son came out,
I would miss it.

835
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:21,880
-[reporter] Are you still hopeful?
-It's fifty-fifty.

836
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,600
I felt so disheartened
whenever someone asked,

837
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,560
"If something happens to your son,

838
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:34,320
where will you find the money
for the funeral?"

839
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,800
I was so devastated.

840
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:42,040
I pray that we find the boys
no matter what happens to them.

841
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,680
Let us find their bodies at least.

842
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,400
[thunder rumbling]

843
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:03,160
It can be said that as of now,
the mission hasn't been successful.

844
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,520
People are anxious.

845
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:11,240
Today, Phra Khuva Boonchum,
who is Chiang Rai's most respectable monk,

846
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,800
has been invited here.

847
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:17,400
He has come to perform the rituals
to beg for forgiveness

848
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,520
and to open the cave entrance.

849
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,840
[cameras clicking]

850
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,720
Phra Khuva Boonchum came to free
the spirits and say a prayer for them.

851
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:35,040
Legend has it that Khuva Boonchum
was Jao Mae's loved one in a past life.

852
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:40,480
Before Khuva Boonchum came,
it rained all day.

853
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:44,080
It rained heavily.
But as soon as he came, the rain stopped.

[all chanting]

855

[Patchanee] When Phra Khuva Boonchum
arrived, he meditated.

856
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:53,360
He said the kids were fine.

857
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:56,600
They were together.
They were alive, they weren't dead.

858
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:02,800
I stopped crying
because I was told my son was all right.

859
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,120
I was happy.

-[man 2] Exit on the right.

[bell tolling]

863
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:20,280
Let's pray for the children
who have been missing for the past week.

864
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,240
They were praying all around the world.

[kids praying]

866
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:34,160
It was a huge amount of good karma.
It came from everywhere.

[foreboding music playing]

01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:07,320
[Eak] By the ninth day,
we almost had no energy left.

[tense music playing]

875
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,680
We were on the edge of life and death.

876
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:22,880
[Mix] Eak worked harder than anyone
to try to get us out.

[Eak] I was a mess on the inside.

01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:43,440
It got to be too much while I was digging,
so I would cry secretly.

[sobbing]

885
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,960
I was afraid people would forget me.

886
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:07,880
That they might have thought,
"These 13 kids weren't going to make it."

887
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,440
And they would forget about us.

888
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:17,280
[Tle] We were all in really bad shape.

889
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,600
Everyone was sitting around
hugging each other, ready to give up.

890
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:23,040
We thought, "At this point,
we don't care if we die."

[solemn music playing]

892
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:51,160
Some of them said,
"Whoever dies first will be eaten."

893
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,680
If anyone died, that person would
become food for their friends

894
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,840
so that their friends would survive.

895
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:10,760
That night, I went to sleep
and I started saying,

896
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:14,440
"Tomorrow, if we still
can't get through, that's it."

[Mark] My body couldn't take it anymore.

01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:46,400
I was lying in one position.
Curled up and hugging myself.

[ominous music playing]

902
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,760
I couldn't think.

903
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:04,360
Everyone was thinking,
"This is probably our last day."

904
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:08,680
It was like I was dying.

[shivering]

906
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:17,240
[Mark] Around that time,
our batteries were about to run out.

907
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:22,400
So Eak told us to turn off the flashlights
and just be with each other.

[water bubbling]

913
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:49,120
It sounded like… air bubbles.

[bubbling]

Then I heard what sounded like, "Hello."

01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,600
It was like a force had woken me.

[Tee] Everyone was shocked.

921
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:22,120
We rushed down.
I said, "Hurry, before they leave!"

[music continues]

923

[Titan] I almost fell into the water
when I jumped down.

924
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,000
I cried. I cried.

925
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,160

[boy 1] Hey, somebody ask him for food.

932
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:13,320
We were so happy.
Someone came to rescue us.

933
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:16,680
[chuckles] I didn't know what to say.

934
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,400
I was so grateful
someone finally came for us.

935

He'll come back again.

[John in English] Okay? We'll come.

943

[boy 1] Tell him we're hungry.

944
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:46,800
[Adul] I already did.
He said he understood.

945
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:48,960
He brought some chocolate.

946
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:52,160
"Should we ask him? Should we ask?"

947
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:58,800
But nobody dared to ask him.
It was freaking hilarious. [chuckles]

948
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:02,880
-I am very happy.
-[John] We… We are happy too.

949
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,680
[Adul] Yes. Thank you so much.

950
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,000
-Thank you so much.
-[John] Okay.

951
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:11,320
[Eak] I was proud.
I was so proud of the boys

952
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:15,400
If the boys hadn't been strong enough
mentally as well as physically,

953
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:18,000
they probably wouldn't have survived
to be rescued.

954
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,200
[John] Tomorrow, many of us come.

[in Thai] They said we should wait here.

958
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:34,160
That Thai divers were coming.

When I heard that, I was confused.

01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:48,200
I thought the foreign diver
was getting us out,

felt like a weight

there were still challenges ahead.

The next thing we needed to figure out

1030
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:18,440
was creating a strategy
to get the kids out safely.

1031

[Craig] For the Thai government,
they didn't know what to do.

1032
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:28,040
And that's certainly
not a criticism of the Thais,

1033
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:32,040
because any country in the world
wouldn't have had a… a plan for this.

1034
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:34,920
It was a situation
that hadn't been experienced before.

[Richard] There are a lot
of very experienced cave divers worldwide

1037
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:42,800
who would have been
up to the task of getting to the point

1038
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,800
where they could assist
with rescuing the kids.

1039
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:49,480
But the one thing that set us apart
from many others

1040
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:53,920
was the… the medical skills
we could also bring, uh, to this rescue,

1041
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:59,080
and obviously, as an anesthetist
and as a vet with anesthesia experience,

1042
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:02,640
you know, that, uh, was
a very important asset for us to have.

[gentle music playing]

1044
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:09,760
The risk of diving out
conscious boys was immense.

1045
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:12,360
The likelihood
was that those boys would panic.

1046
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,000
And panic is death, basically.

1047

[in Thai] Three hundred is still…

1048
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:21,000
[Apakorn in English]
We thought of different methods.

1049
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:24,200
I even thought that maybe we would
have to wait for the water to drop,

1050
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:27,080
which would have taken four months.

1051
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:30,240
In the meantime,
we would send in food and water.

[indistinct chatter]

1053
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:37,240
[Adul] I was shocked when I heard
about the plan for us to stay there

1054
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:40,440
until the water level dropped
or until the end of the season.

1055
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:44,080
I thought, "What?
Why do we have to wait that long?"

1056

[indistinct chatter]

1057
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:48,920
I felt discouraged.

1058
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
[pensive music playing]

1059
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,280
[Craig] As it was thought about more,

1060
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:57,640
obviously the conditions
weren't all that sanitary in there,

1061
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:00,360
and that became a lot worse
once the boys were eating

1062
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,680
because that has inevitable products.

1063
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:08,800
So they were likely to be
getting sick, getting infections with,

1064
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,240
you know,
beyond the reach of…of medical help.

1065
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:17,440
It was going to be
a fairly slow and very unpleasant death.

1066
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:24,080
[Richard] So, you know, when all these
other plans and ideas fell away,

1067
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:26,040
only one solution was left.

1068
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:29,960
And that… that was
sedating the children and diving them out.

1069
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:36,480
You don't even need to be
a cave diver or an anesthetist

1070
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:41,200
to realize that the concept
of rendering a child unconscious,

1071
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:46,120
pushing their head underwater,
and then three hours later,

1072
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:48,960
expecting that when
you reemerge from the water,

1073
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:50,920
that those children
are still gonna be alive,

1074
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,440
it's just a preposterous idea.

1075
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,240
[Craig] There were three things
that I could see

1076
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,600
would inevitably happen to these children.

1077
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:00,960
The masks would fill with water,
and they'd drown.

1078
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:03,480
Their airway would obstruct,
and they'd suffocate.

1079
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:05,120
And the final thing I was worried about,

1080
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,920
if those two things
didn't take the lives of the kids,

1081
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,800
with the 23-degree temperature
of the water and the air in the cave,

1082
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:14,280
over the course
of three hours, under anesthesia,

1083
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:17,280
their core temperature would
steadily but surely head down south,

1084
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:20,040
and they'd slowly freeze
to death in the cave.

1085
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:25,560
I think, in the end,
I justified it to myself by saying,

1086
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:29,720
"If I do this anesthetic,
they're probably going to die."

1087
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,360
"But at least
they'll be asleep when they die."

[indistinct chatter]

1089
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,800
[Apakorn] We had to
inform the parents of our plan

1090
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:46,000
and they had to accept the risks.

1091
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:49,440
There was a possibility
that some of these kids might not survive.

1092
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,160
It was risky either way,

1093
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:56,200
and they told me
I had to sign a consent form.

1094
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:59,040
If I didn't,
the SEAL team couldn't get them out.

[rain pattering]

1096
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:05,400
If we waited for the rainy season to end,

1097
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:07,360
it would be three or four months.

1098
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:08,760
The chance would be zero.

1099
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:12,600
If we took a risk to get them out,
it was at least fifty-fifty.

1100
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:16,240
We had to make a decision.
It was a tough call.

1101
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:24,760
[Ei Khan] I decided to sign it.
It was a very difficult decision.

1102
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:25,880
I was scared.

1103
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:29,440
It wasn't like we were happy
when they informed us.

1104
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,600
I wasn't happy. I was scared.

1105
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:34,160
I was afraid they wouldn't get out.

-[water dripping]
-[indistinct chatter]

1107
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,160
[Eak] They phrased it
like they were trying to make us think

1108
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:49,760
of diving as something fun.

1109
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,680
They didn't want to stress the kids out.

1110
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:55,440
[man in Thai]
We have to wait for level three.

1111
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:57,240
We have to wait
for the water level to drop.

1112
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,000
[in English] I wanted to dive.

1113
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:03,360
[Mix] I was excited to do it.

1114
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:08,720
[Titan] I had no idea it was that risky.

1115
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,720
Back then all I thought about
was getting out.

1116
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:13,760
That was it.

1117

[pensive music playing]

1119
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:32,360
Because you had to dive a long distance
to get to them,

1120
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:35,640
you used the entire oxygen tank.

1121
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:42,640
When you dived back,

1122
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:47,280
you had to use a tank that was put there
to replace the one you had used up.

1123
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:54,000
[man] The starting point
is only 300 meters from this spot.

1124
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:57,760
But here the water is falling down
from the cave walls.

1125
01:17:58,360 --> 01:17:59,960
We have to dive down to get through.

1126
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:02,080
Stay tuned for tomorrow.

1127
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:03,840
We can do it.

1128
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:07,360
We SEALs can do it. We never back down.

1129

His name was Saman Gunan.

1130
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:17,160
He was a petty officer in the SEALs.

1131
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:24,640
That day, he had volunteered
to place the equipment.

1132
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:31,680
While diving back he lost consciousness.

1133

[somber music playing]

1134
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:37,400
He never woke up.

1135
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:45,000
[woman] I found out in the morning.

1136
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:49,000
I texted someone
who was in the same department.

1137
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:51,280
They…

1138
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,640
They said he had passed.

1139
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:58,720
[women sobbing]

1140
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:00,920
[in Thai] I just saw him.

[wailing]

1142
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,400
[in English] That day,
they sent him on a plane.

1143
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:09,240
I was delirious.

1144
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:11,680
I kept calling out his name.

1145
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:14,240
I kept calling out to him

1146
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:19,200
and saying to myself,
"It's not true. It's not true."

1147
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,960
I knew he had to do the rescue mission.

1148
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:33,240
These boys were still in there.
I understood that.

PETTY OFFICER SAMAN GUNAN
BORN DECEMBER 23,1980 - DIED JULY 6, 2018

1150
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:44,200
I remember just thinking, "If it's killed
a professional former Navy SEAL,

1151
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:47,520
there's no way
these boys are gonna make it out."

[tense music playing]

1154
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:58,400
[Craig] We all turned up thinking

1155
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:02,680
there was really very little prospect
of any success in this.

1156
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:10,800
[Eak] We were able to breathe normally,
but it was getting tougher.

1157
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,720
[labored breathing]

1158
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,320
They said the amount of oxygen
was getting lower inside the cave.

1159
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:24,880
I was quite worried about
what would happen if they ran out of air.

1160
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:28,840
And in the following week,
there would be more rain coming in

1161
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:31,560
that would create more risks.

1162
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:35,280
[James] With the water rising
and oxygen going down,

1163
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:38,200
they had no choice
but to start the rescue mission.

1164
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:44,160
Today, we are fully prepared.
Today is our D-Day.

Authorities say that high-risk operation
is now under way.

Just minutes ago
the local governor called it "D-Day."

1167
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:55,440
It's a rescue attempt
"like no other," they call it.

1168
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,920
It was the first time
this method was used in the world.

someone just announced, "We're on."

Where the boys were
is a little bit over two kilometers.

1172
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:19,800
[Richard] So we knew these kids
were going to have

1173
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:22,440
a three-hour journey out of the cave.

[water sloshing]

1176
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:35,120
I remember as we approached, I thought,

1177
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:39,160
"Here we are. We finally made it through
the cave and they're all going to die."

1178
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:42,360
That's when this was
all about to become a real thing.

[indistinct chatter]

1180
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,280
The kids were amazingly very accepting.

1181
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:50,120
You know, at that stage,
we could've told them

1182
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:52,200
they were gonna be taken out
on a flying carpet,

1183
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:53,640
and they would have agreed to it.

1184
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:56,360
They were just so desperate
to be out of that place by then.

1185
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:01,440
The funny thing was they decided
the kids who lived the farthest distance

1186
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:03,480
from the entrance of the cave
would go first.

1187
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:09,200
Once they got out, the kids planned
to ride their bikes back home

1188
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,040
and get something to eat.

1189
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:16,360
I asked to be the last to leave.

1190
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:21,000
[in Thai] Come on, let's go. Ready?

The first child that I anesthetized,

you know,
I can still remember very clearly.

It's hard to describe what it feels like,

1194
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:43,000
pushing an unconscious child's face
into the water.

1195
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:46,080
That's about as low
as you can go, I think.

Closely followed by, you know,

behind their backs.

1198
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:56,600
The implications of what
I might be doing to these kids,

1199
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:59,200
and that… that might be
signing their death warrant.

[water bubbles popping]

1201

[Craig] Sixteen hundred meters
or so, they were diving.

1202
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:10,120
The boys then
had to come out of the water,

1203

be carried across, uh, the dry land…

1204
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:21,480
[Apakorn] The British diver told us
he would be responsible

1205
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:24,680
for bringing the kids to us
at the third chamber.

1206
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:29,440
From there, we had to come up with a plan
to bring them to the cave entrance.

1207
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:36,360
From the third chamber,
we used 200 people.

[in Thai] Be careful.

1209

was the most at risk.

at least four boys have been brought out.

[Eak] When the last day came,
the plan changed.

1241
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:02,560
I had to go first. I was like, "What?"

1242
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,480
They wanted to take out the biggest first
and the smallest last.

1243
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:10,200
I started to feel uneasy.

1244
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:17,720
I thought that if I got out first
and the parents found out,

1245
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:20,240
they might be mad
that I left their kids behind.

1246

It wouldn't be good.

I didn't know how I was
going to explain it to their parents.

I sat with Dr. Harris.

the needle was stuck into my thigh.

I was the only one left.

There was no one to tell me
to get out safely and cheer me on.

But I thought, "It's fine."

Then I realize being last is cool.

Mark was the last one.

was my parents crying.
