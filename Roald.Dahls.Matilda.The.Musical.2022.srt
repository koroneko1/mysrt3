[muffled fart]

674
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,417
Over there, under those blazers.

675
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,542
[quiet gasps, groans]

676
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:26,375
Where he's been for the last hour!

677
00:36:27,292 --> 00:36:28,125
What?

678
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:29,792
Yeah.

679
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:34,375
You see, Nigel suffers from a rare
but chronic sleep disorder, narcolepsy.

680
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
The condition is characterized
by the sufferer

681
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:39,167
experiencing bouts of fatigue

682
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,792
and falling asleep without any warning.

683
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:44,583
He fell asleep and we put him
in the blazers for safety.

684
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:46,542
Didn't we?

685
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:49,792
Didn't we?

686
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:53,542
-[children agreeing enthusiastically]
-[Nigel yawning]

687
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:56,125
I had the strangest dream, Mum.

688
00:36:56,708 --> 00:36:57,917
I thought I was…

689
00:36:58,958 --> 00:37:00,417
Oh.

690
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,042
Hello, Miss Trunchbull.

691
00:37:06,417 --> 00:37:08,500
[tone chiming on PA system]

692
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:10,208
[amplified] Amanda Thripp.

[crows cawing]

694
00:37:13,458 --> 00:37:16,917
Y-- y-- yes, Miss Trunchbull?

695
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:23,292
What have I said about… pigtails?

696
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:26,375
I hate pigtails.

697
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:28,958
But my mummy likes them.
She says they make me look pretty.

698
00:37:29,042 --> 00:37:31,417
Well, your mother is a twit!

699
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,250

[announcer] <i>That's far! That's very…</i>

704
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:44,292
<i>…and we're there!</i>

705
00:37:44,875 --> 00:37:46,583
[Agatha] Yes! Still got it.

706
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:50,583
Check and see if that child
is still alive, will you?

707
00:37:52,667 --> 00:37:54,333
[clears throat]

708
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:57,500
And what is your name?

709
00:37:57,583 --> 00:37:58,417
Matilda.

710
00:37:59,208 --> 00:38:00,292
Matilda Wormwood.

711
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:04,458
Oh! You're Wormwood, are you?

712
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:08,583
I like troublemakers, Wormwood.

713
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:11,542
They make such a lovely sound…

714
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:14,375
when they snap.

715
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:16,500
[boy] She's alive!

716
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:19,250
-[boy 2] Hip, hip!
-[children] Hooray!

717
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:21,333
-Hip, hip!
-Hooray!

718
00:38:21,417 --> 00:38:23,792
-Hip, hip!
-Hooray!

719
00:38:23,875 --> 00:38:25,625

00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:29,958
[Agatha over PA] <i>Remember, Wormwood,</i>

721
00:38:30,042 --> 00:38:34,375
<i>I promise you that.</i>

722
00:38:37,292 --> 00:38:39,833
[Matilda] And so the great day arrived.

Over Sharks and Spiky Objects

726
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:51,958
Caught by the Man Locked in the Cage.

727
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:57,708
It was like the entire world
had gathered to see the acrobat

728
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:02,667
and the escapologist's incredible
death-defying feat.

729

[women laughing]

734
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,625
Everything was arranged by…

735
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:42,167
the acrobat's evil stepsister.

736
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:46,333
A frightening woman who used to be
an Olympic class hammer thrower.

737
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:50,125
People whispered that in her dark
and brooding heart,

738
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:53,833
she resented her stepsister's
success and love.

739
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,625
[cymbal crashes]

740
00:39:56,708 --> 00:39:58,042
Suddenly…

741
00:39:58,958 --> 00:40:00,833
out came the escapologist,

742
00:40:00,917 --> 00:40:03,208
but there was no sign of the acrobat,

743
00:40:03,292 --> 00:40:06,917
and no glimpse at all
of the shiny white scarf she always wore.

744
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:10,125
Ladies and gentlemen,

745
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:12,500
boys and girls,

746
00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:16,167

Over Sharks and Spiky Objects

00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:23,625
Caught by the Man Locked in the Cage

750
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:26,750

752
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:33,083
Canceled because my wife is…

753
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:34,958
pregnant!

754
00:40:35,542 --> 00:40:37,542
-[all gasping]
-Oh, Matilda.

755
00:40:39,167 --> 00:40:42,292
[Matilda] Absolute… silence.

756
00:40:44,583 --> 00:40:47,250
You could have heard a fly burp.

757
00:40:49,833 --> 00:40:51,708
-Then suddenly, the audience…
-[child] Hip, hip!

758
00:40:51,792 --> 00:40:55,042
…jumped to its feet
and roared in appreciation!

759
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:57,792
[band playing fanfare]

760
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:00,500

761
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,125
-The great feat was instantly forgotten.
-[laughing]

762
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,500
And the applause went on for over an hour!

763
00:41:09,917 --> 00:41:12,625
Oh, Matilda, that's wonderful!

764
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:14,833
I love stories that end happily.

765
00:41:15,917 --> 00:41:20,708
Forgotten by everyone
except the acrobat's evil stepsister.

766
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:26,500
When all had quietened down
she produced a contract!

767
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:28,375
-[Mrs. Phelps] A contract?
-[feedback squealing]

768
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:31,583
[over PA] A contract you have signed
to perform this feat.

769
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:34,583
-And perform this feat, you shall!
-No.

770
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:37,792
[Matilda and Agatha]
I've paid for the posters, publicity,

771
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:40,292
the catering, the toilet facilities.

772
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:42,292
If I give the crowd their money back,

773
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:43,875
where is my profit?

774
00:41:44,458 --> 00:41:47,333
A contract is a contract is a contract.

775
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:49,000
My hands are tied.

Over Sharks and Spiky Objects

779
00:41:57,083 --> 00:42:00,292
Caught by The Man Locked in a Cage
will be performed,

780
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:03,000
and it will be performed this day!

781
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:05,667
Or off to prison you both shall go!

782
00:42:10,042 --> 00:42:11,958
What… what happened next?

783
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:14,833
I dunno.

784
00:42:14,917 --> 00:42:16,875
What? How can you not know?

785
00:42:17,583 --> 00:42:20,667
It just comes to me in… fizzes.

786
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:23,917
Well, could you fizz up
a little bit more for me? Now.

787
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,250
I don't think it works like that.

788
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:28,000
Of course it doesn't.

789
00:42:28,625 --> 00:42:32,250
-Where is this coming from, Matilda?
-What do you mean?

790
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:33,958
I mean, it's incredible.

791
00:42:34,042 --> 00:42:37,000
But it's taking rather a dark turn.

792
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:38,750
Maybe I shouldn't tell you any more.

793
00:42:38,833 --> 00:42:41,292
No, no, no. No.

794
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:43,417
We must find out how it ends.

795
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:46,667
All I'm saying is,
is everything all right?

796
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:47,667
You could tell me.

797
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:51,208
I'd better go, Mrs. Phelps, Mum's waiting.

798
00:42:51,292 --> 00:42:53,833
She gets so upset when she's away from me.

799
00:42:53,917 --> 00:42:57,375
She says every minute
is like an eternity so…

800
00:42:58,167 --> 00:43:00,667
Is she coming here? Can I meet her?

801
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,208
Bye, Mrs. Phelps!

802
00:43:02,292 --> 00:43:04,583
Matilda, tomorrow I'm at the windmill.

803
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:06,417
Okay, I'll find you.

804
00:43:08,292 --> 00:43:10,833
[the Wormwoods arguing faintly]

805
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:14,042
I've got it.

806
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:16,125
-Harry! Let me have it!
-[clattering]

807

-[Harry grunting loudly]
-[Mrs. Wormwood yells]

808
00:43:18,083 --> 00:43:19,417
Hang on then.

809
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,292
[both straining]

810
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:24,458
-[Harry] You're hurting me!
-Yeah. Hold on, hold on.

811
00:43:28,417 --> 00:43:30,250
Let me pull, Harry.

812
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:31,333
Pull then!

813
00:43:35,042 --> 00:43:37,333
[children chattering]

814
00:44:01,625 --> 00:44:02,458
Matilda.

815
00:44:05,958 --> 00:44:08,333
I believe your mind is extraordinary.

816
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:11,500
So I'm taking things into my own hands.

817
00:44:12,625 --> 00:44:13,917
Starting tomorrow,

818
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,500
I'm going to bring in a selection
of very clever books.

819
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:19,083
You can sit and read them
while I teach the others,

820
00:44:19,167 --> 00:44:21,958
and if you have any questions, well…

821
00:44:22,042 --> 00:44:23,750
I shall do my best to answer them.

822
00:44:25,042 --> 00:44:26,250
How does that sound?

823
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:32,292
[gasps, chuckles]

824
00:44:33,542 --> 00:44:34,708
Matilda…

825
00:44:36,167 --> 00:44:37,792
That is the biggest hug in the world.

826
00:44:39,125 --> 00:44:41,333
You're going to hug all the air out of me.

827
00:44:43,792 --> 00:44:45,833
[Agatha, over PA]
What a touching little scene.

828
00:44:50,167 --> 00:44:51,042
Move!

829
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:56,833
I believe I said this maggot
was to receive no special treatment.

830
00:44:56,917 --> 00:45:00,167
In fact, I seem to recall informing you

831
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:05,917
that this particular snot-ball
was evil incarnate, did I not?

832
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,625
No, Miss Trunchbull, Matilda is not--

833
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:09,417
Did you just say "no," Jenny?

834
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,833
To me?

835
00:45:14,792 --> 00:45:18,167
Matilda Wormwood is a criminal.

836
00:45:19,875 --> 00:45:21,042
[over PA] This morning,

837
00:45:21,125 --> 00:45:25,417
a piece of my private
chocolate cake was stolen.

838
00:45:27,667 --> 00:45:31,292
It is my contention that you performed
this vileness, Wormwood, you.

839
00:45:31,375 --> 00:45:33,917
You have two choices,
admit your guilt and be punished,

840
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,625
or call me a liar… and be punished.

841
00:45:39,917 --> 00:45:41,667
Think very carefully

842
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:45,083
about what comes out
of your mouth, Wormwood.

843
00:45:45,667 --> 00:45:47,458
I did not stea--

844
00:45:47,542 --> 00:45:50,792
[loud, prolonged belch]

845
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:57,917

Chocolate.

Bruce Bogtrotter.

849
00:46:28,458 --> 00:46:30,625
[timidly] Yes, Miss Trunchbull?

850

I think I've got the next part
of the story.

1015
00:56:50,875 --> 00:56:52,167
But I shall warn you,

1016
00:56:53,292 --> 00:56:54,667
it's about to get real.

1017
00:56:56,042 --> 00:56:57,042
[crowd gasping]

1018
00:56:58,708 --> 00:57:02,083
[Matilda] Slowly, the acrobat
tied her shiny white scarf

1019
00:57:02,167 --> 00:57:03,750
around her husband's wrist.

1020
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,125
For luck, my love.

1021
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,542
[Matilda] Then she hugged him
with the biggest hug in the world.

1022
00:57:10,625 --> 00:57:14,792
So hard that he felt that
she could hug all the air out of him.

1023
00:57:14,875 --> 00:57:16,042
[roaring]

1024
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:19,542
[Matilda] And so they prepared themselves

1025
00:57:19,625 --> 00:57:23,125
for the most dangerous feat
that had ever been performed.

1026
00:57:23,208 --> 00:57:26,125
[band playing suspenseful music]

1027
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:46,167
The great escapologist had to somehow
escape from the padlocks,

1028
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:51,625
break free from the cage, and attempt
to rescue his wife within 12 seconds.

1029
00:57:51,708 --> 00:57:54,458
Or she would be blown to bits!

1030
00:58:05,125 --> 00:58:06,417
[breathing heavily]

1031
00:58:09,542 --> 00:58:14,000
[Matilda] The moment the fuse was lit,
the acrobat swung into the air.

1032
00:58:14,083 --> 00:58:16,292
-One second, two seconds…
-[grunting]

1033
00:58:16,375 --> 00:58:17,875
…the crowd held their breath

1034
00:58:17,958 --> 00:58:22,958
as she swung higher and higher
above the sharks and spiky objects!

1035
00:58:23,042 --> 00:58:25,167
Three seconds, four seconds.

1036
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:27,667
The evil sister looked on gleefully.

1037
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:30,042
-Five seconds, six seconds.
-[grunting loudly]

1038
00:58:30,125 --> 00:58:32,250
The escapologist
couldn't take his eyes from his wife

1039
00:58:32,333 --> 00:58:34,458
as he struggled in his chains,

1040
00:58:34,542 --> 00:58:37,458
knowing that the tiniest, weeniest mistake

1041
00:58:37,542 --> 00:58:40,417
would mean that he'd lose her
and their child forever.

1042
00:58:41,042 --> 00:58:43,125
Seven seconds, and suddenly…

1043
00:58:43,208 --> 00:58:45,458
-[yells loudly]
-[Matilda] She let go!

1044
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:52,292
The escapologist reached out
with one huge, massive arm

1045
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:53,625
to catch his wife and the child.

1046
00:58:53,708 --> 00:58:55,417
-[acrobat gasps]
-[grunts]

1047
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,333
-[Matilda] Eight seconds!
-No, I can't look.

1048
00:58:57,417 --> 00:59:00,542
Nine seconds! Ten seconds! And…

1049
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:04,583
And… And… Eleven seconds!

1050
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:09,333
He grabbed the dynamite
and flung it far, far away!

1051
00:59:09,417 --> 00:59:13,333
Hurray! So this story does
have a happy ending after all.

1052
00:59:14,167 --> 00:59:15,000
No.

1053
00:59:16,667 --> 00:59:17,583
No, it doesn't.

1054
00:59:18,833 --> 00:59:20,333
[crowd gasping]

1055
00:59:20,417 --> 00:59:21,667
[acrobat exclaims]

1056
00:59:30,875 --> 00:59:34,042
No! Was she okay? Did she survive?

1057
00:59:34,625 --> 00:59:37,292
She broke every bone in her body.

1058
00:59:37,958 --> 00:59:40,167
Except the ones at the ends
of her little fingers.

1059
00:59:41,125 --> 00:59:44,042
She did manage to live long enough
to have their child.

1060
00:59:44,125 --> 00:59:46,542
[baby fussing]

1061
00:59:47,958 --> 00:59:49,625
But the effort was too great.

1062
00:59:51,208 --> 00:59:52,833
Love our girl.

1063
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:58,042
Love our daughter with all your heart.

1064
00:59:59,667 --> 01:00:02,458
She is all we ever wanted.

1065
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:11,167
[crying softly]

1066
01:00:12,708 --> 01:00:13,875
And then she died.

1067
01:00:16,708 --> 01:00:17,750
And then…

1068
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:20,125
things got worse.

1069
01:00:20,208 --> 01:00:21,750
What? Worse?

1070
01:00:21,833 --> 01:00:23,417
I'm afraid they did.

1071
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,875
Because the escapologist was so kind

1072
01:00:25,958 --> 01:00:30,042
that he never for one second blamed
the evil stepsister for what happened.

1073
01:00:30,917 --> 01:00:35,708
In fact, he asked her to move in
and help look after his daughter.

1074
01:00:35,792 --> 01:00:38,167
[Mrs. Phelps]<i> No, no,</i>
<i>don't ask her to move in.</i>

1075
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:40,500
She was nothing but cruel
to the little girl,

1076
01:00:40,583 --> 01:00:43,708
making her wash and clean
all day long. Shouting,

1077
01:00:43,792 --> 01:00:46,208
[Matilda and stepsister]
"Clean the floor and I'll be nice!"

1078
01:00:46,292 --> 01:00:49,458
When the little girl did clean it,
she was even crueler

1079
01:00:49,542 --> 01:00:52,417
because she was
a terrible, terrible cheat!

1080
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,625
I hate cheats!

1081
01:00:53,708 --> 01:00:57,667
All in secret, so the escapologist
never suspected a thing.

1082
01:00:57,750 --> 01:01:00,750
And so the poor little girl grew up
with the meanest, cruelest,

1083
01:01:00,833 --> 01:01:03,875
horriblest aunt
you could possibly imagine!

1084
01:01:03,958 --> 01:01:06,042
Let's call the police! [panting]

1085
01:01:07,042 --> 01:01:08,208
Mrs. Phelps.

1086
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:10,667
It's just a story.

1087
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,125
What?

1088
01:01:14,333 --> 01:01:16,708
Oh. Yes, of course.

1089
01:01:17,375 --> 01:01:18,375
A story.

1090
01:01:19,167 --> 01:01:21,500
It's just, you make it so real.

1091
01:01:22,375 --> 01:01:24,083
[relieved laugh] Your mind, Matilda.

1092
01:01:24,583 --> 01:01:28,042
Your parents must think they've won
the lottery with a child like you.

1093
01:01:28,667 --> 01:01:30,708
Oh… they do.

1094
01:01:31,667 --> 01:01:33,250
They're always saying that.

1095
01:01:33,333 --> 01:01:35,833
In fact, they say,

1096
01:01:35,917 --> 01:01:39,500
"We're so proud of you, Matilda,
you're like winning the…"

1097
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:45,750
Yeah. I'd better go.

1098
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:50,542
[shrieking]

1099
01:01:50,625 --> 01:01:53,833
It's just like winning the lottery!

1100
01:01:53,917 --> 01:01:54,917
What?

1101
01:01:55,542 --> 01:01:56,708
Me?

1102
01:01:56,792 --> 01:01:59,250
You? No, you're like
eating someone else's bogeys.

1103
01:01:59,333 --> 01:02:01,583
Like winning a snottery, you, boy.

1104
01:02:01,667 --> 01:02:02,708
I'm a girl.

1105
01:02:02,792 --> 01:02:04,542
But how, Harry?

1106
01:02:04,625 --> 01:02:06,208
Remember that big, muscly idiot?

1107
01:02:06,292 --> 01:02:08,958
Turns out he had a whole lot
of muscly mates.

1108
01:02:09,042 --> 01:02:10,625
Bucketloads of cash.

1109
01:02:10,708 --> 01:02:13,042
Everyone wanting a luxury car.

1110
01:02:13,125 --> 01:02:17,292
All I had was a load of old bangers,
each with 100,000 miles on the clock.

1111
01:02:17,375 --> 01:02:20,375
So, I did what any decent
business leader would.

1112
01:02:20,458 --> 01:02:21,500
What?

1113
01:02:21,583 --> 01:02:22,875
I bought a drill.

1114
01:02:22,958 --> 01:02:26,875
Attached it to the speedometer
and whacked it in reverse.

1115
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:29,417
I put back the mileage
on every one of those cars

1116
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:33,083
and sold them to those big,
muscly idiots, resulting in…

1117
01:02:33,167 --> 01:02:34,875
Money!

1118
01:02:34,958 --> 01:02:36,083
But you cheated them!

1119
01:02:37,417 --> 01:02:38,333
Excuse me?

1120
01:02:38,417 --> 01:02:41,875
You cheated them.
What you did, it wasn't right.

1121
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:43,417
You're just a cheat!

1122
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,375
Oh, the little pig!

1123
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:50,875
It's the books, Harry.
It's the books and the stories.

1124
01:02:50,958 --> 01:02:52,250
Is it now?

1125
01:02:53,125 --> 01:02:53,958
Books, is it?

1126
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:58,500
You know what I'm going to do tomorrow?

1127
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,583
I'm going to go down to that library,

1128
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:05,750
I'm going to tell that old bag
to never let you in again.

1129
01:03:05,833 --> 01:03:07,125
What?

1130
01:03:07,208 --> 01:03:10,000
Always sticking your nose in
where it don't belong.

1131
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:14,875
You nasty little creep!

1132

[gasping]

1133
01:03:22,958 --> 01:03:27,667
That night, the escapologist's daughter
cried herself to sleep.

1134
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:31,458
She never said a word
about the evil step-aunt's bullying.

1135
01:03:31,542 --> 01:03:33,875
She didn't want to add
to her father's pain.

1136
01:03:34,583 --> 01:03:38,083
This only encouraged the woman
to greater cruelties,

1137
01:03:38,167 --> 01:03:41,500
until one day she exploded.

1138
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:45,042
[Agatha and Matilda] Sticking your
nose in where it doesn't belong!

1139

You nasty little creep!

1140
01:03:47,542 --> 01:03:50,667
And she threw her…
threw her into a dank,

1141
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:54,292
dark, dusty cellar,
locked the door and went out.

A-are you all right, Miss Trunchbull?

[gasps]

1408
01:20:59,708 --> 01:21:01,708
I moved it with my eyes.

1409
01:21:03,542 --> 01:21:04,792
Am I strange?

1410
01:21:08,708 --> 01:21:11,500
How do you fancy a… nice cup of tea?

[thunder rumbling]

1412
01:21:23,292 --> 01:21:25,250
[Miss Honey] Oh, no, no, no.
Not that way. This way.

1413
01:21:26,917 --> 01:21:30,292
[Matilda] What do you think it is?
This thing with my eyes.

1414
01:21:31,042 --> 01:21:32,583
[Miss Honey] Well, what did it feel like?

1415
01:21:34,042 --> 01:21:35,417
[Matilda] Felt like fizzing.

1416
01:21:36,125 --> 01:21:37,167
Fizzing.

1417
01:21:38,125 --> 01:21:40,208
But not bad fizzing, good fizzing.

1418
01:21:41,125 --> 01:21:42,208
Good fizzing.

1419
01:21:43,083 --> 01:21:45,125
Good fizzing. Hm…

1420
01:21:45,792 --> 01:21:47,958
Okay, let's see.

1421
01:21:48,875 --> 01:21:52,500
I'm no expert because I'm not sure
there are experts in fizzing,

1422
01:21:52,583 --> 01:21:56,292
but I think it has something to do
with that incredible mind of yours.

1423
01:21:57,458 --> 01:22:00,292
You mean, there's no room in my head
for all my brains?

1424
01:22:00,375 --> 01:22:02,625
So they have to squish out
through my eyes?

1425
01:22:03,375 --> 01:22:06,583
Well, yes.
Yes, that's exactly what I mean.

1426
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:10,375
Well, here we are.

1427
01:22:11,083 --> 01:22:12,125
[Matilda] Where are we?

1428
01:22:19,917 --> 01:22:21,000
Wow.

1429
01:22:21,083 --> 01:22:23,500
They pay teachers really badly.

1430
01:22:24,875 --> 01:22:28,542
-Well, actually, yes, they do.
-[lighting match]

1431
01:22:29,417 --> 01:22:31,292
But I'm poorer even than most.

1432
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,583
You see, my father died when I was young.

1433
01:22:38,667 --> 01:22:42,042
Magnus was his name. He was so kind.

1434
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:46,125
[sighing] But… when he was gone,

1435
01:22:46,208 --> 01:22:48,708
my aunt became my legal guardian.

1436
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:54,208
And she was cruel and mean
like you cannot even imagine.

1437
01:22:54,792 --> 01:22:58,375
Then when I became a teacher,
she presented me with a bill.

1438
01:22:59,167 --> 01:23:00,542
She'd written everything down.

1439
01:23:00,625 --> 01:23:04,958
Every teabag, every gas bill,
every tin of beans.

1440
01:23:05,042 --> 01:23:08,750
She made me sign a contract
to pay her back every single penny.

1441
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:10,083
Really?

1442
01:23:10,167 --> 01:23:13,917
She even produced a document that said
that my father gave her his house.

1443
01:23:14,875 --> 01:23:17,750
But did he really do that, Magnus,

1444
01:23:17,833 --> 01:23:19,875
did he just give her his house?

1445
01:23:20,917 --> 01:23:25,000
Well, I've always felt it was…
suspicious.

1446
01:23:25,583 --> 01:23:28,917
You see, she said his death
was an accident, but…

1447
01:23:30,583 --> 01:23:32,125
You think she did him in!

1448
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:36,875
Well, I cannot say for sure.

1449
01:23:38,333 --> 01:23:43,750
All I really know is that years of being
bullied by that woman made me, well…

1450
01:23:45,208 --> 01:23:46,375
pathetic.

1451
01:23:48,292 --> 01:23:52,125
Then one day, I came across this old shed.

1452
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:54,708
I fell in love with it.

1453
01:23:56,167 --> 01:23:59,292
I begged the farmer who owned it
to let me move in.

1454
01:24:00,208 --> 01:24:02,500
He thought I was mad, but…

1455
01:24:03,583 --> 01:24:05,417
he said "yes," and…

1456
01:24:07,458 --> 01:24:09,167

You need to be very careful.
