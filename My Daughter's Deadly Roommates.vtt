01:30.257 --> 01:30.923
Morning.

01:33.152 --> 01:35.094
Are you excited about
your first day of college?

01:36.839 --> 01:39.489
No, mom, I am not excited.

01:39.508 --> 01:41.767
I should be off at
college like my friends.

01:41.994 --> 01:43.251
I'm sorry your father
didn't come through

01:43.270 --> 01:44.752
With his half of the tuition.

01:44.772 --> 01:47.013
I would've gotten a smaller
house if I had known.

01:47.166 --> 01:49.108
Next semester, you'll
be wherever you want.

01:49.259 --> 01:50.517
I promise.

01:50.669 --> 01:52.260
I have a couple
potential clients

01:52.279 --> 01:54.504
Who seem interested in my
company's new migraine medicine.

01:54.598 --> 01:56.857
I just need to land one of them.

01:56.951 --> 01:58.433
I hope so!

01:58.452 --> 02:01.011
Because living with my
mommy while I start college

02:01.104 --> 02:02.454
Is not exactly
what I had in mind.

[coffee pouring]

02:12.466 --> 02:13.632
Thanks for the donuts.

02:16.879 --> 02:20.222
I have work after class
today, so I'll be home late.

02:25.871 --> 02:26.728
[aubrey] hi, uncle jason.

02:28.315 --> 02:28.981
Hold up.

02:31.226 --> 02:31.892
Love the skirt.

02:31.986 --> 02:33.393
I'm sure you do.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.153
You bought it for me.

02:34.304 --> 02:34.987
I have good taste.

02:36.398 --> 02:37.881
You look ready to
conquer your first day.

02:37.974 --> 02:39.616
-Thanks, uncle jason.

Don't forget, it's
"dr. Fountain"

02:42.404 --> 02:44.237
When you see him on campus.

02:44.331 --> 02:45.289
That's gonna be weird.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.333
Have a great day, sweetheart.

02:48.485 --> 02:49.576
Dr. Fountain.

02:49.670 --> 02:50.335
Maybe.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.248
You need to stop worrying.
She's gonna be fine.

02:55.342 --> 02:56.824
You got coffee, right?

02:56.844 --> 02:59.236
Well, I just wish I
had enough money

02:59.329 --> 03:00.737
To let her go off to college.

03:00.756 --> 03:02.497
Aubrey isn't gonna have
any trouble making friends.

03:02.591 --> 03:03.765
Everyone loves her.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.519
How about I check in
with her this afternoon?

03:07.671 --> 03:08.312
Thank you.

03:10.024 --> 03:11.673
I'm so glad my new job
brought us closer to you.

03:29.359 --> 03:30.709
-Hey.
-Thanks for meeting me.

03:30.936 --> 03:32.193
Sure.

03:32.287 --> 03:32.860
How's your first day going?

03:32.880 --> 03:34.696
Pretty boring.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.198
All we did in my first
class was read the syllabus,

03:37.218 --> 03:38.533
So that's fun.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.944
And now, I have to go to work,

03:40.963 --> 03:43.113
So who needs fun or friends?

03:43.206 --> 03:44.965
Oh, come on, you'll
make friends.

03:45.059 --> 03:46.283
You always do.

03:46.301 --> 03:46.975
Thanks.

03:48.896 --> 03:49.978
Okay, work time.

03:51.899 --> 03:52.639
Can you do me a favor?

03:52.733 --> 03:54.307
Sure.

03:54.460 --> 03:56.626
Can you tell your mom something
good that happened today?

03:56.720 --> 03:58.553
She's going through a lot too,

03:58.572 --> 04:00.297
And I know it would
make her feel better.

04:00.315 --> 04:02.574
Okay, I'll try to
think of something.

04:04.136 --> 04:05.802
You know,

04:05.821 --> 04:07.412
You can always tell her how
good it is to see me on campus.

04:09.065 --> 04:10.916
Nah, I'll think of
something better than that.

04:12.644 --> 04:13.159
I changed your diapers.

04:13.312 --> 04:14.811
Ew.

04:14.904 --> 04:18.423
[soft contemplative music]

04:25.766 --> 04:29.250
Ooh, hey, gamma's having
a mixer this Friday.

04:29.270 --> 04:30.176
Okay.

04:30.271 --> 04:30.936
Oh, hey, hey.

04:32.831 --> 04:34.106
Oh, hi.

04:34.333 --> 04:35.348
Sorry, I was trying
to get your attention.

04:35.442 --> 04:36.441
Oh, that's okay.

04:36.593 --> 04:38.168
What's up?

04:38.186 --> 04:39.352
You must be a freshman.

04:39.446 --> 04:40.353
I haven't seen you on campus.

04:40.506 --> 04:41.354
Yeah, yeah actually.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.023
Today's my first day.

04:43.175 --> 04:44.574
Have any of the
sororities talked to you?

04:46.102 --> 04:47.527
Great, I'm glad I
got to you first.

04:47.679 --> 04:48.862
So, the gammas are having
a mixer this Friday.

[ominous music]

04:55.945 --> 04:57.187

Is in the budget for
me this semester.

05:00.375 --> 05:01.616
That's too bad.

06:00.861 --> 06:03.177
Checking out the
first girl now.

06:03.271 --> 06:04.196
I think you'll approve.

[books clattering]

06:19.771 --> 06:20.212
Thanks.

06:20.439 --> 06:21.454
No problem.

06:21.548 --> 06:22.622
Anything I can help you find?

06:22.716 --> 06:23.882
Oh, I was just browsing.

06:25.386 --> 06:27.052
Do you have any recommendations?

06:28.055 --> 06:29.704
Do you like arthur long?

06:29.723 --> 06:30.705
He's my favorite author.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.182
Oh, mine too.

06:33.619 --> 06:34.726
Really?

06:34.953 --> 06:36.210
Well, his new book
just came out.

06:36.304 --> 06:37.211
I can show you.

06:37.305 --> 06:38.188
It's with the new releases.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.125
You look familiar.

06:42.144 --> 06:43.068
Do you go to sdu?

06:44.888 --> 06:46.479
Maybe I've seen
you around campus.

06:46.573 --> 06:47.313
Oh, I doubt it.

06:47.408 --> 06:48.073
I just started today.

06:48.224 --> 06:49.491
I'm sure I've seen you.

06:50.802 --> 06:52.469
I'll figure it out.

06:52.487 --> 06:53.412
I'm carter, by the way.

Hi, carter.

I'm aubrey.

06:57.142 --> 06:58.808
I've got it.

06:58.827 --> 07:00.752
Were you speaking one of
those sorority girls earlier?

07:00.979 --> 07:03.663
Maybe for like a few
minutes after class.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.257
I bet that's it.

07:05.484 --> 07:06.666
Are you gonna rush?

07:06.760 --> 07:07.717
I'm thinking about it.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.988
Have you considered
greek life alternatives?

07:12.007 --> 07:13.323
What do you mean?

07:13.341 --> 07:15.249
I'm a part of this great group.

07:15.269 --> 07:18.495
We're almost like a
sorority, only better.

07:18.588 --> 07:19.604
We aren't affiliated
with the school,

07:19.756 --> 07:21.498
So we don't have
any of the rules.

07:21.516 --> 07:22.256
And we're free.

07:22.350 --> 07:23.016
Really, you're free?

07:23.110 --> 07:24.501
Totally.

07:24.594 --> 07:25.852
Not that that matters to you,

07:26.004 --> 07:28.838
But we're smaller than
a normal sorority,

07:28.857 --> 07:30.431
Which is great.

07:30.525 --> 07:32.342
We're more like a family.

07:32.360 --> 07:33.768
Some of the girls
are gonna come over

07:33.787 --> 07:35.787
To my apartment tomorrow
night if you're interested.

07:37.349 --> 07:39.440
I'd love for you to
meet the other members.

07:39.460 --> 07:41.108
They're like my sisters.

07:41.203 --> 07:42.777
That sounds really awesome.

07:42.796 --> 07:43.628
I have to work tomorrow night.

07:43.855 --> 07:45.205
I'm closing.

07:45.357 --> 07:48.024
Mm, come after closing.

07:48.117 --> 07:49.468
You're not in high
school anymore.

07:54.549 --> 07:55.882
You're welcome to
bring your roommate.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.058

07:58.053 --> 08:01.813

of those in a while.

08:30.085 --> 08:31.568
Guess your day was
better than expected.

08:31.586 --> 08:32.827
I guess it was.

08:32.921 --> 08:34.829
So tell me about it.

08:34.923 --> 08:36.998
Well, classes were boring,

08:37.092 --> 08:39.667
But I do think I made a friend.

08:39.686 --> 08:40.852
That's great.

08:41.004 --> 08:43.170
I mean, I'm not surprised.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.673
Is your new friend in
one of your classes?

08:45.692 --> 08:47.767
No, but she goes to southern.

08:47.919 --> 08:51.087
I met her at the bookstore
and she invited me to hang out

08:51.180 --> 08:53.273
With some of her
friends tomorrow night.

08:53.425 --> 08:54.274
Don't you have work?

08:54.426 --> 08:55.367
Yeah, I'll go after.

08:56.928 --> 08:58.111
I'm in college now.

08:58.263 --> 08:59.596
I know,

08:59.689 --> 09:00.613
And that's why I
want to remind you

09:00.766 --> 09:01.948
That you're still under age.

09:02.100 --> 09:03.691
Okay, we've talked about
this a million times.

09:03.710 --> 09:04.784
I know I sound like a
broken record, but I just--

09:04.936 --> 09:06.286
No, no, no.

09:06.438 --> 09:07.528
You promised that if I
agreed to move in with you

09:07.548 --> 09:09.196
To save money,

09:09.216 --> 09:11.457
You'd give me the freedom to
be a real college student.

09:11.793 --> 09:13.126
You're right, you're right.

09:13.278 --> 09:15.795
I know I'm right,
I know I'm right.

09:15.947 --> 09:16.555
-Love you.
-Aww.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.801
Did carter pick from
the girls we sent her?

09:21.953 --> 09:23.787
Mm-hmm, two of them.

09:23.880 --> 09:25.789
She invited them
here tomorrow night,

09:25.882 --> 09:28.458
So she wants
everybody to be here.

09:28.476 --> 09:30.643
Ooh, I'll send a message
to the group chat.

09:30.737 --> 09:31.795
Perfect.

09:31.813 --> 09:33.071
Hopefully he'll be pleased.

09:50.315 --> 09:51.256
I was just in your
biology class with you.

09:53.485 --> 09:54.834
I remember your name

09:54.928 --> 09:56.986
'cause you answered that
question on gene therapy.

09:57.005 --> 09:58.888
Even the professor was
impressed with that one.

10:00.158 --> 10:01.415
Thanks.

10:01.509 --> 10:03.417
Anyway, I'm pre-med

a good study partner.

I have a lot on my plate
right now with work and school

10:13.171 --> 10:16.189
And I don't know if
it's the best time.

10:16.341 --> 10:17.765
If you're that busy,

10:17.784 --> 10:19.117
Wouldn't it be easier to
have somebody to study with?

10:21.012 --> 10:21.620
Maybe.

10:25.517 --> 10:26.625
I have to go, but...

10:28.962 --> 10:30.587
Give me your number
and I'll think about it.

10:33.282 --> 10:34.966
I bet I can turn that
maybe into a yes.

We'll see.

meeting new people.

we call our group.

12:42.929 --> 12:47.432
I'd like to introduce you
to izzie, kate, and diana.

Yup, I am.

You're lucky.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.971
I didn't find the kinship
until I was a sophomore.

13:27.198 --> 13:28.973
And joining was the best
decision you've ever made.

13:29.125 --> 13:30.809
It's true.

13:30.960 --> 13:33.369
We empower each other to
be the best that we can be.

13:33.462 --> 13:35.721
I'd do anything for
any of these women

13:35.816 --> 13:37.874
And they'd do the same for me.

13:37.892 --> 13:40.393
It's unlike anything
I've ever been a part of.

So tell me, how's the new job?

13:51.480 --> 13:53.072
My boss stopped by
my office today,

13:53.166 --> 13:54.666

With how well I'm

14:19.267 --> 14:20.525
You know, it might be easier

If you just thought of the
two of you as roommates.

I could probably pay
for utilities and stuff.

25:42.449 --> 25:43.874
Ugh, we'll figure it out.

25:44.877 --> 25:45.626
Okay.

25:47.029 --> 25:47.670
Thank you.

25:52.793 --> 25:54.718
Speaking from experience,

25:54.945 --> 25:58.889
College is way more fun
without a mom hovering.

26:00.634 --> 26:03.018
[phone beeping]

26:09.977 --> 26:11.318
Are those your old friends?

26:14.131 --> 26:15.531
You don't need to
feel left behind.

26:19.912 --> 26:20.578
Smile.

26:24.325 --> 26:28.586
Miss you too, and send.

26:30.756 --> 26:33.507
They're not the only ones making
new friends and having fun.

26:35.761 --> 26:36.510
You're right.

26:37.838 --> 26:38.596
Of course I am.

26:43.677 --> 26:44.393
Oh,

26:48.165 --> 26:50.107
Nice place.

26:50.334 --> 26:51.424
Thanks.

26:51.518 --> 26:52.776
We just moved in,

26:53.003 --> 26:54.353
So there's still a lot
of unpacking to do.

26:54.505 --> 26:56.113
Oh.

26:56.340 --> 26:58.782
Well, maybe you wont
have to unpack after all.

27:02.012 --> 27:05.030
Oh, aubrey didn't mention

27:05.182 --> 27:06.290
You were joining us
for dinner tonight.

27:06.517 --> 27:08.125
Oh, I'm not.

27:08.352 --> 27:10.461
Aubrey just invited me
over to see the new place.

27:10.688 --> 27:11.295
She did?

27:13.540 --> 27:15.374
-[knocking on door]
-oh.

27:15.468 --> 27:17.468
That must be your pizza.

27:17.619 --> 27:20.638
It was so nice to see
you again, ms. Stanton.

27:20.865 --> 27:22.364
Well, you're more than
welcome to join us.

27:22.383 --> 27:24.933
Thanks, but I have plans.

27:32.151 --> 27:33.651
Think about my offer.

27:33.878 --> 27:35.135
I will.

27:35.154 --> 27:36.302
Okay.

27:36.322 --> 27:37.062
Call me later.

27:37.156 --> 27:38.072
Okay.

27:39.900 --> 27:41.216
Hi.

27:41.309 --> 27:42.734
[charlotte] do you
want another piece?

27:42.887 --> 27:44.119
Oh no, I'm stuffed.

27:46.481 --> 27:50.501
So, what did carter
offer you earlier?

27:54.732 --> 27:58.509
She actually offered
me to move in with her.

27:58.736 --> 27:59.418
What?

27:59.512 --> 28:00.344
Completely rent free.

28:01.755 --> 28:03.013
Aubrey, you just met her.

28:03.240 --> 28:04.573
So?

28:04.666 --> 28:06.183
Living with new
people isn't easy.

28:07.335 --> 28:08.410
Did you even think this through?

28:08.503 --> 28:09.978
Yes, I've thought it through.

28:11.339 --> 28:12.431
I knew you were gonna say this

28:12.583 --> 28:13.691
And that's why I didn't
even bring it up.

28:13.918 --> 28:15.693
I just don't think it's
a good idea, aubrey.

28:15.920 --> 28:16.819
Of course you don't.

28:27.281 --> 28:29.689
Did you tell your mom
you're moving out?

28:29.783 --> 28:31.433
I told her you offered,

28:31.452 --> 28:34.119
But she's not happy
about the idea.

28:34.213 --> 28:36.672
What's she gonna do, ground you?

28:38.275 --> 28:39.199
Very funny.

28:39.293 --> 28:41.276
She's not that bad.

28:41.295 --> 28:42.945
If you want to be a
part of the kinship,

28:43.038 --> 28:45.614
Then we need to rethink
your living situation.

28:45.707 --> 28:48.133
We don't want a mom hovering.

28:48.285 --> 28:50.018
I know, it's just--

28:51.564 --> 28:53.138
You're 18.

28:53.290 --> 28:54.356
She can't stop you.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.217
You're right.

28:57.311 --> 28:59.027
I'll get my stuff
after work tomorrow.

29:22.987 --> 29:24.553
I was early, so
I got our drinks.

29:30.494 --> 29:31.101
Chai latte?

29:32.587 --> 29:34.496
How'd you know
that's my favorite?

29:34.589 --> 29:36.256
It's what you were
drinking yesterday.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.442
You remember, on our first date?

29:38.669 --> 29:41.261
Oh, yeah.

29:41.355 --> 29:42.428
Actually, I take it back.

29:42.448 --> 29:44.097
I think that's not nice.

29:44.116 --> 29:45.023
That's creepy.

29:45.175 --> 29:46.266
Come on, I got you a cookie.

29:46.285 --> 29:47.284
That's gotta be nice.

29:49.346 --> 29:50.788
You're right, the
cookie is nice.

29:59.023 --> 30:01.690
Second date and we're
already sharing food?

30:01.708 --> 30:03.383
Might be moving a
little fast for me.

30:07.214 --> 30:08.806
[carter] I thought you said
she wasn't dating anyone.

30:08.957 --> 30:10.307
[sable] that's
what she told me.

30:13.053 --> 30:15.229
Get elle, bring her
to the apartment.

30:16.631 --> 30:18.065
We'll deal with this
situation later.

30:23.989 --> 30:25.823
Is the drink okay, or?

30:30.554 --> 30:31.119
Sorry, what?

30:35.225 --> 30:37.668
You never mentioned
a revenge task.

30:37.895 --> 30:40.486
Don't you want to be a
member of the kinship?

30:40.506 --> 30:42.673
I do, I think.

30:45.419 --> 30:47.752
I can't sleep with a professor.

30:47.847 --> 30:50.072
Of course you can.

30:50.165 --> 30:51.431
Why do you want me to do that?

30:53.243 --> 30:55.686
Because dr. Arthur failed
sable last semester.

30:55.913 --> 30:57.596
Mm-hmm.

30:57.748 --> 30:58.689
I almost got kicked out
of school because of him.

31:00.508 --> 31:03.277
Listen, it'll be worth it.

31:04.771 --> 31:07.489
Once you sleep with dr.
Arthur, you'll be one of us.

31:10.536 --> 31:11.618
What about aubrey?

31:14.039 --> 31:15.205
Does she have a revenge test?

31:15.357 --> 31:17.115
Of course.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.266
Everyone does.

31:18.360 --> 31:20.435
Don't you worry about aubrey.

31:20.528 --> 31:22.546
We have something
special planned for her.

31:27.294 --> 31:28.944
You better hurry.

31:29.037 --> 31:30.629
You don't wanna keep
dr. Arthur waiting

31:30.723 --> 31:33.181
When he was so nice enough to
stay late to meet with you.

31:35.561 --> 31:36.727
I need a second.

31:40.474 --> 31:41.899
Sable will be watching.

31:43.310 --> 31:45.152
Don't disappoint us.

31:52.060 --> 31:54.060
I don't think elle might
be a fit for the kinship.

31:54.154 --> 31:55.996
But she already knows too much.

31:58.642 --> 32:02.252
We could shut her
up if we need to.

32:05.832 --> 32:07.424
[ominous ambient music]

32:46.281 --> 32:48.131
I'm meeting with a student
before I can leave.

32:49.693 --> 32:50.801
I know.

32:50.952 --> 32:52.452
Tell lucy I promise
I'll teach her

32:52.471 --> 32:53.971
How to make grandma's chocolate
chip cookies tomorrow.

32:55.365 --> 32:56.139
Thanks.

32:57.384 --> 32:57.975
I love you too.

33:00.037 --> 33:01.311
Wait.

33:01.463 --> 33:01.979
Are you elle?

33:12.566 --> 33:15.993
[intense orchestral music]

33:20.165 --> 33:22.958
[knocking on door]

33:26.580 --> 33:28.005
Is aubrey here?

33:29.008 --> 33:30.340
No, are you okay?

33:32.236 --> 33:34.919
Warn her, tell her to stay
away from the kinship.

33:35.072 --> 33:36.179
The kinship?

33:37.758 --> 33:41.334
Is someone trying to
hurt you or aubrey?

33:41.353 --> 33:42.477
Tell her to stay away!

33:43.856 --> 33:44.646
Wait!

33:47.584 --> 33:50.694
[ominous ambient music]

33:56.201 --> 33:58.869
[phone vibrating]

34:02.266 --> 34:03.114
What now?

34:03.267 --> 34:03.874
I'm busy.

34:04.025 --> 34:05.358
I need to talk to you.

34:05.377 --> 34:06.859
You always need to talk to me.

34:06.879 --> 34:08.528
It's important.

34:08.547 --> 34:09.713
I need you to come home as
soon as you get off of work.

34:09.864 --> 34:10.881
Yeah, okay, whatever.

34:28.550 --> 34:29.733
Thanks for coming with me.

34:30.811 --> 34:31.693
Is your mom asleep?

34:34.481 --> 34:35.238
I don't think so.

34:36.742 --> 34:38.742
She was really
upset on the phone, so...

34:40.637 --> 34:42.245
Maybe it's best
if you stay here.

34:45.584 --> 34:47.709
You're right, I'm not asleep.

34:50.664 --> 34:52.255
I thought you'd be alone,

34:52.407 --> 34:53.757
But maybe carter can help
explain what's going on.

34:56.169 --> 34:57.427
I'm always happy to help.

35:00.099 --> 35:01.264
What?

35:01.416 --> 35:03.158
What's going on, mom?

35:03.176 --> 35:05.677
I had a disturbing visit
from a friend of yours.

35:05.829 --> 35:06.436
Who?

35:08.756 --> 35:10.440
She didn't say,
she was too upset.

35:10.592 --> 35:12.167
She said she was
a friend of mine?

35:12.185 --> 35:14.185
I assume she was a friend

35:14.338 --> 35:17.781
Because she came to warn
you about the kinship.

35:19.693 --> 35:20.784
What's the kinship?

35:22.512 --> 35:23.245
I don't--

35:24.606 --> 35:26.456
Aubrey, don't you remember

35:26.608 --> 35:28.291
When I warned you
about the kinship?

35:29.369 --> 35:31.686
Oh yeah, right.

35:31.705 --> 35:33.521
I knew it sounded familiar.

35:33.540 --> 35:35.298
Did one of the
members approach you?

35:39.138 --> 35:40.378
I don't know.

35:40.530 --> 35:41.713
What do you mean,
you don't know?

35:41.807 --> 35:45.791
Well, that group is very
secretive, ms. Stanton.

35:45.811 --> 35:48.127
It's possible that aubrey
spoke with one of the members

35:48.147 --> 35:49.312
And didn't even know.

35:49.464 --> 35:51.631
You seem very
familiar with them.

35:51.650 --> 35:53.725
Well, there's a lot
of rumors about them.

35:53.877 --> 35:56.319
They're very popular on campus.

35:57.731 --> 35:58.638
Well, whoever they are,

35:58.657 --> 36:00.323
They terrified that poor girl.

36:02.219 --> 36:03.451
Don't worry about aubrey.

36:04.812 --> 36:05.620
I'll keep her safe.

36:08.333 --> 36:10.892
Carter, if you don't
mind, it is very late.

36:10.911 --> 36:12.836
I would like to speak
to aubrey on my own now.

36:12.987 --> 36:14.171
Actually, mom,

36:15.399 --> 36:16.506
I'm gonna go get my stuff, okay?

36:16.733 --> 36:17.841
I'm gonna stay with
carter for a while.

36:17.992 --> 36:19.009
Excuse me?

36:21.405 --> 36:22.179
Do you want to help me pack?

36:22.406 --> 36:23.013
Yeah.

36:26.743 --> 36:29.853
[ominous ambient music]

36:42.701 --> 36:45.202
You did great standing
up to your mom.

36:45.353 --> 36:46.703
Yeah, it felt good.

36:48.207 --> 36:50.832
I'm just gonna get a few
things and we are out of here.

36:55.363 --> 36:57.714
Do you think you could do a
favor for me before we go?

36:59.960 --> 37:00.675
I can try.

37:02.779 --> 37:04.387
The other day, your mom said

37:04.539 --> 37:07.465
That she had some samples
of migraine medications.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.059
Yeah, I remember.

37:09.210 --> 37:11.786
I saw a stack of them
by her briefcase.

37:11.805 --> 37:13.563
Do you think you could
grab a couple for me?

37:16.384 --> 37:19.069
Sable has migraines and she
can't afford the medicine.

37:20.797 --> 37:21.721
You said you wanted
to contribute,

37:21.815 --> 37:22.739
So this would be the way.

37:24.634 --> 37:25.575
Isn't that illegal?

37:25.802 --> 37:26.576
How?

37:26.728 --> 37:27.560
Your mom's not a doctor.

37:27.579 --> 37:28.578
She gives them out all the time.

37:30.640 --> 37:32.565
I could go grab them
if you'd rather.

37:32.659 --> 37:37.545
No, no, I'll do it.

37:39.907 --> 37:42.384
I don't want my mom to see
you like snooping around, so.

37:49.101 --> 37:51.101
Grab a few while you're at it.

can see how happy you look.

scared you so bad.

you to sleep with him.

by and apologize to you too.

[ominous ambient music]

41:43.651 --> 41:46.652
You did it, you cut the cord!

41:46.671 --> 41:47.295
How's it feel?

41:49.657 --> 41:50.423
It feels good.

41:52.902 --> 41:54.677
I can't stop thinking though

41:54.904 --> 41:56.495
About who came to
my house earlier.

41:56.589 --> 41:57.680
Did carter tell you about that?

41:57.907 --> 41:59.331
Mm-hmm.

41:59.351 --> 42:00.183
It really freaked my mom out.

42:00.334 --> 42:01.601
It was probably just elle.

42:02.521 --> 42:03.745
Yeah, but why would elle

42:03.838 --> 42:05.004
Want to warn me
about the kinship?

42:05.023 --> 42:06.839
She got kind of upset

42:06.858 --> 42:10.101
Because we asked her to do
a little initiation task.

42:10.195 --> 42:12.678
Initiation task, what's that?

42:12.772 --> 42:14.589
Well, everyone has to do a task

42:14.682 --> 42:16.491
Before they're initiated
into the kinship.

42:17.594 --> 42:18.350
Do I have to do one?

42:18.370 --> 42:19.702
Everyone does.

42:19.929 --> 42:21.871
It's too bad elle
didn't do hers.

42:22.023 --> 42:23.665
I thought she wanted
a place to belong.

42:26.119 --> 42:27.785
Wait, she's out of the kinship?

42:27.937 --> 42:29.287
Well, it's not
entirely up to me,

42:29.439 --> 42:32.698
But her actions have
proven she isn't loyal.

42:32.717 --> 42:35.534
We have to be able to
count on each other.

42:35.628 --> 42:37.628
What was she supposed to do?

42:37.722 --> 42:38.946
Enough about elle.

[jason] that girl who stopped
by really has you worried.

You should have seen
her, she was terrified.

43:04.991 --> 43:06.324
What did aubrey say when
you told her about it?

43:06.476 --> 43:07.825
Not much.

43:07.977 --> 43:11.495
Carter took over, said
it was probably a prank.

43:11.648 --> 43:12.571
Could it have been?

43:12.591 --> 43:14.649
No, no, there is no way.

43:14.742 --> 43:16.426
That girl was
genuinely terrified.

43:18.096 --> 43:20.321
Carter had the nerve to
tell me not to worry,

43:20.340 --> 43:21.848
That she would take
care of aubrey.

43:26.179 --> 43:28.329
No, no, no, I have
class tomorrow, I can't.

They weren't any help.

Aubrey's 18, she's an adult.

44:26.164 --> 44:27.646
What'd they say about the
girl that stopped by earlier?

44:27.666 --> 44:28.814
They said they'll let me know

44:28.908 --> 44:30.583
If they need anything
else from me.

I can't keep doing
this with you, okay?

over to the house--

I almost lost my job today.

45:01.274 --> 45:03.515
I realized there
were samples missing.

45:03.535 --> 45:05.443
Do you know anything about it?

45:05.537 --> 45:06.852
Does that sound like
something I would do?

45:06.946 --> 45:08.612
No, but nothing you're
doing these days

45:08.707 --> 45:09.831
Sounds like you, aubrey.

45:11.935 --> 45:13.042
I had to report it.

45:14.361 --> 45:15.937
Report it?

45:16.030 --> 45:18.363
My clients expect a
certain amount of samples.

45:18.458 --> 45:19.941
I had to report it to get more.

45:19.959 --> 45:21.384
Aubrey, I am new.

45:23.054 --> 45:24.679
I could have gotten
into a lot of trouble.

45:32.046 --> 45:33.879
Could carter have done it?

45:33.898 --> 45:34.897
She was at the house.

45:41.906 --> 45:44.532
Aubrey, are you sure
you don't know anything?

45:45.577 --> 45:47.802
Mom, you sound ridiculous, okay?

45:47.820 --> 45:49.412
I've never done anything
like that before

45:49.563 --> 45:50.972
And I wouldn't
start doing it now.

45:50.990 --> 45:52.749
So I think it's
best for both of us

45:52.900 --> 45:53.875
If you give me some space.

throughout high school

at my job every single day,

get me some space now.

carter forgot to mention

We don't really like for
you to bring guys here.

be more of a safe space

hasn't caught on yet.

I'm staying with carter.

them, not read them.

48:43.479 --> 48:45.070
I text aubrey's mom

48:45.164 --> 48:46.881
And then I delete the
messages and block her again.

That way, I have
complete control.

gonna sleep all day.

it in here again.

It's almost 1:00.

I slept through all my classes.

It doesn't matter.

gonna change tomorrow.

49:47.485 --> 49:49.485
I made sure there was a member
in each of your classes.

Did your mom reach out to you?

49:58.904 --> 50:01.405
Mm, that's great.

She's just giving you
the space you need.

go take a shower.

50:22.428 --> 50:23.269
I don't think so.

50:25.523 --> 50:27.106
It's time for the initiation.

50:30.086 --> 50:34.030
That is, after you complete
the initiation task.

50:34.257 --> 50:34.846
Yeah, what?

50:34.866 --> 50:35.614
What is that?

50:36.517 --> 50:37.533

I'm fine.

might be working

51:30.830 --> 51:32.088
When you didn't
respond to my text.

51:33.424 --> 51:35.165
What?

51:35.318 --> 51:36.759
I haven't missed
any text from you.

51:40.339 --> 51:42.080
Yeah, I don't have anything.

51:42.100 --> 51:43.173
That's weird.

51:43.267 --> 51:44.016
Can I see?

51:50.274 --> 51:51.849
You blocked me?

51:51.943 --> 51:53.334
What?

51:53.427 --> 51:54.518
No, no, I didn't
do it on purpose.

51:54.670 --> 51:56.186
I don't even know
how to do that.

51:56.280 --> 51:57.113
You want me to fix it?

51:57.340 --> 51:58.030
Yes, please.

You want to grab dinner later?

52:07.032 --> 52:09.199
I do, I have plans tonight.

52:09.352 --> 52:10.868
No worries.

you plan on blocking me again.

Wait here.

No, she's been living
with me for a while now.

And I was wondering
if aubrey invited you

To george's tavern
tomorrow night.

52:57.066 --> 52:58.490
No?

52:58.509 --> 52:59.675
A bunch of us are going.

53:00.994 --> 53:01.594
You should come.

53:03.589 --> 53:05.764
Come around 9:00, surprise her.

53:06.684 --> 53:07.349
She'll love it.

53:08.835 --> 53:09.476

[aubrey] is this a fake id?

53:47.132 --> 53:48.224
Just a perk of the kinship.

I don't how anyone
wears skirts this short.

You see that dark
haired guy at the bar?

54:03.741 --> 54:04.740
That's my ex.

54:06.577 --> 54:08.827
We dated for almost two
months and then he ghosted me.

54:11.231 --> 54:12.706
Okay, so what am
I supposed to do?

54:14.085 --> 54:16.252
Hook up with him tonight
and then ghost him.

54:18.647 --> 54:19.672
I think that's fair.

54:20.574 --> 54:23.408
[laughing]

54:23.427 --> 54:27.154
You mean like, hook up with him?

54:27.172 --> 54:29.014
I could send this
picture to your mom.

54:32.252 --> 54:33.418
You said you deleted that.

54:33.512 --> 54:34.603
I deleted one copy.

54:37.516 --> 54:40.276
After you finish
this, I'll delete it.

54:42.688 --> 54:44.505
You know what you should do?

54:44.523 --> 54:45.281
Hook up with him.

54:46.933 --> 54:50.119
Then, you can take a selfie
and send it to carter.

54:51.514 --> 54:53.122
You know I love my pictures.

54:56.035 --> 54:58.201
How am I supposed to
get him to do that?

54:58.296 --> 55:00.921
Have you seen how good
you look in this skirt?

55:02.858 --> 55:05.634
He will definitely want
what you've got going on.

55:05.861 --> 55:07.636
I think your mom
would like this video.

55:12.476 --> 55:13.267
What do you think?

55:15.813 --> 55:17.229
That's a good one.

55:18.482 --> 55:20.316
Oh, okay, okay, if I do that,

55:22.227 --> 55:23.635
Those pictures and
videos get deleted

55:23.729 --> 55:24.878
And you leave my mom alone?

55:24.971 --> 55:26.897
Of course. Why wouldn't I?

55:26.991 --> 55:28.306
Once you finish this,

55:28.326 --> 55:29.158
You'll be a member
of the kinship.

55:56.912 --> 55:57.519
Hi.

55:58.597 --> 56:00.247
Hi.

56:00.265 --> 56:01.190
You wanna buy me a drink?

56:04.420 --> 56:05.110
I'd love to.

56:07.698 --> 56:10.949
I'll leave her mom
alone, for now.

56:12.203 --> 56:13.369
What are you drinking?

56:15.021 --> 56:16.330
-Whatever you're having.
-Perfect.

56:17.875 --> 56:19.266
What's your name?

56:19.284 --> 56:21.526
-Aubrey.
-Zach.

56:21.620 --> 56:22.878
-Zach?
-Yeah.

56:23.105 --> 56:24.880
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

56:28.219 --> 56:30.386
Persistent and punctual.

56:47.220 --> 56:49.405
So, do you come here much?

56:50.983 --> 56:53.367
This is like my little spot.

56:56.580 --> 56:58.229
I'm so sorry.

56:58.323 --> 56:59.640
I didn't realize aubrey

56:59.733 --> 57:02.142
Was meeting someone
else here tonight.

57:02.161 --> 57:03.902
It's no big deal.

57:03.996 --> 57:05.170
It's not like we're dating.

57:06.649 --> 57:07.756
-Yeah.
-Do you go to school here?

57:08.592 --> 57:09.383
Yeah.

57:11.320 --> 57:13.887
To tell you the truth,
you're dodging a bullet.

57:15.674 --> 57:17.433
Aubrey's not as nice
as you might think.

57:19.828 --> 57:24.440
-[upbeat pop music]
-[people chattering]

57:40.273 --> 57:41.531
You know, I have to admit.

57:41.625 --> 57:43.459
I was a little surprised
when you approached me.

57:43.686 --> 57:44.376
Why's that?

57:45.854 --> 57:47.111
You're with carter.

57:47.131 --> 57:48.547
I assume you know she's my ex.

57:53.028 --> 57:53.635
I know.

57:57.716 --> 58:00.476
Wait, are these what
I think they are?

58:03.872 --> 58:04.480
Oh yeah.

58:06.800 --> 58:09.726
Wow, that was really fast.

58:09.820 --> 58:10.986
Aren't you a bad girl?

58:11.137 --> 58:12.738
You have no idea
how bad I can be.

58:14.808 --> 58:17.567
Why don't we send
carter a little picture?

58:17.661 --> 58:18.327
Okay.

58:30.490 --> 58:33.342
[camera shutter]

58:40.518 --> 58:41.517
What?

58:42.520 --> 58:43.185
What?

58:46.598 --> 58:47.597
I don't think I can do this.

58:47.691 --> 58:49.432
What do you mean?

58:49.585 --> 58:51.860
Trust me though,
you're better off.

58:52.087 --> 58:52.653
Aubrey.

58:58.536 --> 58:59.760
What are you doing here?

58:59.778 --> 59:01.778
You finished your task.

59:01.872 --> 59:03.038
It's initiation time.

59:04.375 --> 59:09.211
Come on, get in.

59:16.779 --> 59:18.295
What are you doing?

59:18.389 --> 59:19.721
What are you guys doing?

59:19.948 --> 59:21.181
What are you doing?

59:22.393 --> 59:23.708
What's going on?

59:23.727 --> 59:25.543
We're making you
an official member.

59:25.563 --> 59:26.544
What?

59:26.564 --> 59:27.470
What?

59:27.623 --> 59:29.213
Ow.

59:29.233 --> 59:29.982
What?

59:35.647 --> 59:37.314
What do you do?

59:37.408 --> 59:38.148
What?

59:38.242 --> 59:39.223
We've all done it.

59:39.318 --> 59:40.409
It doesn't hurt that bad.

59:41.745 --> 59:43.579
Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no.

59:43.806 --> 59:45.138
I don't want to do it,
I don't want to do it.

59:45.157 --> 59:46.156
Carter, oh, no, no, no.

59:46.250 --> 59:46.990
I don't want to do it.

59:47.142 --> 59:48.417
It bonds us forever.

59:48.644 --> 59:51.311
No, no, no, I don't
want to do it, okay?

59:51.404 --> 59:52.921
No, I don't want to
be a part of this.

59:53.073 --> 59:54.164
I don't want to
be a part of this.

59:54.258 --> 59:55.924
I don't want to do it.

-Dr. Bradley?
-Yes.

1:00:37.301 --> 1:00:39.209
Hi, I was trying to
meet my daughter,

1:00:39.361 --> 1:00:41.044
Aubrey stanton, after class.

1:00:41.138 --> 1:00:42.453
Did I miss her?

1:00:42.473 --> 1:00:44.139
Aubrey dropped my
class a few weeks ago.

1:00:45.534 --> 1:00:46.549
Why?

1:00:46.702 --> 1:00:48.143
You'll have to ask her.

1:00:48.294 --> 1:00:49.369
The only thing the
university does

1:00:49.388 --> 1:00:51.388
Is send me the add
drop notifications.

1:00:51.540 --> 1:00:53.223
I don't understand.

1:00:53.375 --> 1:00:55.150
Yeah, you must be looking
at an old schedule.

1:00:55.377 --> 1:00:56.818
I really wish she
would've called me

1:00:57.045 --> 1:00:59.154
Or talked to me before
she dropped out.

1:00:59.305 --> 1:01:00.380
I'm so sorry.

1:01:00.473 --> 1:01:01.490
I mean, she had
tremendous potential.

1:01:03.476 --> 1:01:03.992
What was she thinking?

1:01:04.144 --> 1:01:05.309
She's premed.

1:01:05.404 --> 1:01:06.620
It doesn't seem like her.

1:01:07.998 --> 1:01:09.981
When's the last time
you were alone with her?

1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:10.666
It's been a while.

1:01:11.894 --> 1:01:13.243
What about when you call?

1:01:13.337 --> 1:01:16.988
Carter's always with her
and she never answers calls,

1:01:17.007 --> 1:01:19.157
Only responds to
texts sporadically.

1:01:19.176 --> 1:01:20.400
I do not like how much control

1:01:20.493 --> 1:01:21.418
She's given this carter girl.

1:01:21.570 --> 1:01:22.177
I know.

1:01:25.407 --> 1:01:26.589
There's someone I think
you should talk to,

1:01:26.742 --> 1:01:28.408
A professor at the university

1:01:28.427 --> 1:01:31.019
And he specializes in
brainwashing and cults.

1:01:31.171 --> 1:01:31.853
Oh my god.

1:01:38.178 --> 1:01:39.844
You think aubrey's in a cult?

1:01:39.938 --> 1:01:41.363
I didn't say that,

1:01:41.514 --> 1:01:44.533
But she's definitely
changed a lot.

1:01:46.036 --> 1:01:48.870
Can we wait and see
what happens tomorrow?

1:01:51.208 --> 1:01:53.433
You're hoping she'll show
up for your birthday?

1:01:53.452 --> 1:01:55.877
We always have pizza and
watch movies together.

1:02:01.552 --> 1:02:03.534
I remember those days.

1:02:17.568 --> 1:02:19.217
[camera shutter]

1:02:19.311 --> 1:02:19.901
Send it to carter.

1:02:22.965 --> 1:02:24.147
Oh.

1:02:24.299 --> 1:02:25.073
Let's go.

1:02:32.916 --> 1:02:33.582
-Hey!
-Hi.

1:02:35.068 --> 1:02:36.084
-Hey.
-Hi.

1:02:36.311 --> 1:02:38.661
-I'm sable.
-Oh, hi, I'm christina.

1:02:38.756 --> 1:02:40.313
Nice to meet you.

1:02:40.332 --> 1:02:41.664
Are you new to this school?

1:02:41.759 --> 1:02:42.924
Oh yeah, I transferred--

1:02:56.923 --> 1:02:59.107
Hey, what's wrong with you?

1:03:01.186 --> 1:03:02.277
It's my mom's birthday.

1:03:04.339 --> 1:03:05.947
I texted her but she
didn't respond, so.

1:03:07.509 --> 1:03:10.844
Well, you asked her
to give you space

1:03:10.937 --> 1:03:13.121
And she's giving it to you.

1:03:13.273 --> 1:03:14.122
That's a good thing.

1:03:15.125 --> 1:03:16.941
I guess,

1:03:16.960 --> 1:03:21.129
But I don't want her to be
on her own on her birthday.

1:03:26.378 --> 1:03:27.803
I think I should go over there.

1:03:28.955 --> 1:03:31.548
Maybe I'll bring some pizza.

1:03:31.700 --> 1:03:33.624
We have this tradition
where we get pizza.

1:03:33.644 --> 1:03:35.293
You know what?

1:03:35.312 --> 1:03:37.646
I went through the
same exact thing.

1:03:37.797 --> 1:03:40.315
I missed my mom when
I first moved out,

1:03:40.466 --> 1:03:43.985
But then I realized how
great the freedom is.

1:03:45.322 --> 1:03:46.112
Yeah.

1:03:48.050 --> 1:03:50.492
I know you're right,
but I don't know.

1:03:50.719 --> 1:03:52.327
Hey, we can order
pizza if you want.

1:03:54.389 --> 1:03:54.996
Want to?

1:03:58.669 --> 1:03:59.334
Sure.

1:04:15.410 --> 1:04:17.185
-She didn't show up?
-No.

1:04:19.414 --> 1:04:21.356
She sent a happy birthday text

1:04:21.507 --> 1:04:23.024
And when I asked her
how she was doing,

1:04:24.510 --> 1:04:25.318
She didn't respond.

1:04:36.598 --> 1:04:40.542
At least she texted and
remembered your birthday.

1:04:42.195 --> 1:04:46.882
I guess I shouldn't
have bothered.

1:04:49.369 --> 1:04:50.218
We need to celebrate.

1:04:51.555 --> 1:04:52.962
You got wine?

1:04:53.056 --> 1:04:55.223
[laughing]

1:04:57.561 --> 1:05:01.304
Thank you for staying
and helping me celebrate.

1:05:01.398 --> 1:05:02.063
Of course.

1:05:03.567 --> 1:05:05.400
I'm sorry you didn't
get to have dinner

1:05:05.551 --> 1:05:06.793
With austin tonight.

1:05:06.886 --> 1:05:08.570
Oh, don't even worry about that.

1:05:08.721 --> 1:05:11.222
Austin didn't want you to be
alone on your birthday either.

1:05:11.241 --> 1:05:13.408
I need to find a
good man like that.

1:05:14.912 --> 1:05:16.653
Don't we all?

1:05:16.747 --> 1:05:19.039
[laughing]

1:05:23.403 --> 1:05:25.754
You know, I think it's time

1:05:25.905 --> 1:05:29.257
We talk to that
professor you mentioned.

1:05:30.427 --> 1:05:33.244
I don't know what else to do.

1:05:33.263 --> 1:05:34.054
Maybe he can help.

1:05:35.490 --> 1:05:36.097
Yeah.

1:05:37.826 --> 1:05:38.992
How about we try to catch him

1:05:39.010 --> 1:05:40.393
Before his first
class in the morning?

1:05:41.271 --> 1:05:42.270
Okay.

1:05:45.925 --> 1:05:47.275
Better save this for aubrey.

warn aubrey about the kinship.

This is my sister,

1:06:45.744 --> 1:06:46.893
Our daughter's a freshman
here at the campus.

1:06:46.986 --> 1:06:48.336
Nice to meet you, ms. Stanton.

1:06:48.488 --> 1:06:49.295
Please have a seat.

1:06:50.490 --> 1:06:51.673
-Thank you.
-Pleasure.

1:06:56.238 --> 1:06:59.422
I've got 15 minutes
before my first class.

1:06:59.574 --> 1:07:01.016
What can I do for the
two of you this morning?

1:07:03.002 --> 1:07:05.669
Jason tells me
you research cults

1:07:05.689 --> 1:07:10.341
And cult behaviors
like brainwashing.

1:07:10.360 --> 1:07:11.693
I do.

1:07:11.920 --> 1:07:14.604
My father, he was
obsessed with cults,

1:07:14.756 --> 1:07:18.033
And after he died, I
found all his research.

1:07:18.184 --> 1:07:21.327
I guess you can say that my
interest in cults is hereditary.

1:07:22.781 --> 1:07:27.208
I'm concerned about my
daughter's new friends.

1:07:27.435 --> 1:07:30.712
They seem to have
taken over her life.

1:07:32.274 --> 1:07:33.548
Can you explain more to me?

1:07:35.552 --> 1:07:38.628
I've barely seen my
daughter in weeks.

1:07:38.722 --> 1:07:41.890
It's like she can't
even think for herself.

1:07:43.468 --> 1:07:45.393
She's so smart, I don't
know how this happened.

1:07:46.955 --> 1:07:48.454
Have you tried
getting her alone?

1:07:48.473 --> 1:07:49.564
Many, many times.

1:07:51.309 --> 1:07:52.550
I even talked to the police.

1:07:52.569 --> 1:07:55.236
They promised to do a
welfare check today.

1:07:58.300 --> 1:07:59.407
We're specifically
concerned about a group

1:07:59.559 --> 1:08:01.301
Called the kinship.

1:08:01.319 --> 1:08:02.410
Have you ever heard of them?

1:08:04.306 --> 1:08:06.748
We think they're here on campus.

1:08:06.899 --> 1:08:09.642
I'm not familiar
with the kinship.

1:08:09.661 --> 1:08:10.993
Are they the ones

1:08:11.146 --> 1:08:12.087

1:23:18.828 --> 1:23:22.121
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I had no idea.

1:23:25.317 --> 1:23:26.333
I heard your talk.

1:23:29.672 --> 1:23:30.987
I listened from the hall

1:23:31.007 --> 1:23:32.506
'cause I wasn't sure
you wanted to see me.

1:23:34.510 --> 1:23:35.734
I'm really sorry

1:23:35.827 --> 1:23:36.844
About everything that
you went through.

1:23:38.239 --> 1:23:40.663
I wish I understood
and helped.

1:23:40.683 --> 1:23:42.349
You don't have to
apologize, luke.

1:23:43.519 --> 1:23:45.019
I'm the one who
should be apologizing.

1:23:45.246 --> 1:23:46.520
Everything that
happened that night,

1:23:46.747 --> 1:23:48.413
It was all a part
of the manipulation.

1:23:48.432 --> 1:23:49.023
I know now.

1:23:50.918 --> 1:23:52.359
And I should have
realized that wasn't you.

1:23:54.030 --> 1:23:57.865
Well, I have been
thinking about texting you

1:23:58.016 --> 1:23:59.424
So many times.

1:23:59.443 --> 1:24:02.611
I just wasn't sure if
you wanted to see me.

1:24:02.763 --> 1:24:04.329
Maybe we could meet for coffee?

1:24:07.859 --> 1:24:09.209
I think I have a better idea.

1:24:10.621 --> 1:24:11.545
We're gonna go to dinner.

1:24:12.773 --> 1:24:14.006
If you wanted to join us,

1:24:15.609 --> 1:24:16.717
I'd really like for
you to meet my mom.

1:24:18.721 --> 1:24:19.386
I'd like that.

1:24:20.781 --> 1:24:21.388
Me too.

1:24:25.377 --> 1:24:27.544
So, would you consider
this our second first date?

1:24:27.563 --> 1:24:28.729
Or our first third date?

1:24:31.734 --> 1:24:36.570
-[soft optimistic music]
-[people chattering]

1:24:44.471 --> 1:24:47.414
[ominous ambient music]
