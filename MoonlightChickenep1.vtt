00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.369
The Covid-19 situation appears to be improving.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.647
However, the overall picture of the economy has yet to improve.

00:00:36.647 --> 00:00:42.000
However, the overall picture of the economy has yet to improve.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.744
Today's scoop will take you to see the atmosphere of a tourist destination like Pattaya.

00:00:47.744 --> 00:00:52.324
It appears that the cost of living here has skyrocketed,

00:00:52.324 --> 00:00:56.550
in contrast to the current economic situation that is still in a recession.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.884
The majority of restaurant owners have raised their prices

00:01:00.884 --> 00:01:04.455
because they can no longer absorb the rising ingredient costs.

00:01:04.455 --> 00:01:06.471
What's interesting is that

00:01:06.471 --> 00:01:10.829
some eateries insist on charging the same prices as before

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:14.663
because they understand people who struggle to make ends meet.

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:18.980
Like this Hainanese Chicken Rice diner

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.473
that is popular among night-goers,

00:01:23.473 --> 00:01:25.529
Moonlight Chicken.

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:29.157
It’s also known as Midnight Chicken Rice to many customers.

00:01:29.157 --> 00:01:32.309
Aside from their delicious Chicken Rice,

00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:34.857
what draws customers to this diner is that

00:01:34.857 --> 00:01:36.802
they serve an unlimited amount of Chicken Rice after midnight.

00:01:36.802 --> 00:01:40.727
In other words, customers can order additional servings until they are satisfied.

00:01:40.727 --> 00:01:44.651
After midnight, as I close my diner,

00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:48.141
I want my customers to eat as much as they want.

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:49.434
I want to fill their stomachs until they are satisfied.

00:01:49.434 --> 00:01:51.230
That's how we spread joy to everyone before calling it a night.

00:01:51.483 --> 00:01:53.620
Bummer! I even bought a new shirt for this.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.573
They don’t friggin’ show me.

00:01:55.573 --> 00:01:57.247
Who do you think you are?

00:01:57.247 --> 00:01:58.799
They must focus on the owner.

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.906
No, I should be included as well. I've been working here longer than him.

00:02:02.906 --> 00:02:04.296
Here you go.

00:02:04.296 --> 00:02:06.551
You big talker! Why are you bothering him?

00:02:06.551 --> 00:02:08.401
220 baht? But I gave you a 500-baht banknote.

00:02:08.401 --> 00:02:10.162
Are you sure you've done the math correctly?

00:02:10.162 --> 00:02:12.142
What’s going on? Let me help you, ma’am.

00:02:12.142 --> 00:02:14.100
The change is 100 baht short.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.676
100 baht, right?

00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:16.546
Our food is just a bit over 100 baht.

00:02:16.546 --> 00:02:19.729
Okay. Here you go.

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:21.424
Now we’re talking.

00:02:21.424 --> 00:02:23.783
My apologies.

00:02:23.783 --> 00:02:25.901
Li Ming, why didn’t you use the calculator?

00:02:25.901 --> 00:02:27.775
Or you can ask Leng to help.

00:02:27.775 --> 00:02:29.763
It's just basic math. I can do it in my head.

00:02:29.763 --> 00:02:31.763
You've never made a mistake and charged a customer the wrong amount?

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.832
It’s almost 10. Go get rest.

00:02:34.832 --> 00:02:36.130
Uncle Jim.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.725
The interest on our money pool this time is 35 baht.

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:43.807
Mom said you would have to pay the interest only 3 more times.

00:02:44.092 --> 00:02:45.291
Got it. Wait a minute.

00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:46.533
Sure.

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:49.841
Uncle Jim, the internet data this month has reached. I need money to recharge it.

00:02:49.841 --> 00:02:51.391
Hold on, Li Ming.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.450
Here you go. I can use this money to pay for his tuition.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.817
Here. Mom asked me to give this to you.

00:02:56.817 --> 00:02:58.744
Your mom or you exactly?

00:02:58.744 --> 00:03:00.592
Damn it, Leng!

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:08.372
Here, Li Ming. Your internet fee.

00:03:10.446 --> 00:03:12.000
Jim, can I have the bill?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.110
Of course.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.824
Leng, bill Table 2.

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.067
All right, sir.

00:03:18.511 --> 00:03:20.920
Only 35 baht for 1 dish.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.174
Thank you so much.

00:03:22.174 --> 00:03:23.410
Please have a seat.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.017
Leng, take her order.

00:03:25.017 --> 00:03:27.458
Gai, help me.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.000
Bring that to them.

00:03:58.468 --> 00:04:00.468
Can you clear up the rest?

00:04:00.468 --> 00:04:02.097
You can lock the door. I’ve already brought out the key.

00:04:02.858 --> 00:04:04.679
Bring some food home.

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:06.662
No, thanks. Praew wanted to have Somtum tonight.

00:04:06.662 --> 00:04:08.512
Maybe her period is approaching.

00:04:09.018 --> 00:04:12.139
You should be relieved that she still has her period.

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:13.807
Yeah. So true.

00:04:13.807 --> 00:04:15.361
It's best if she still has her period.

00:04:15.361 --> 00:04:16.731
See you, Uncle Jim.

00:04:16.731 --> 00:04:19.222
See you. Drive safe.

00:04:19.222 --> 00:04:20.472
I will.

00:04:46.163 --> 00:04:48.163
Mister.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Mister.

00:05:18.197 --> 00:05:20.197
Would you like me to call a cab?

00:05:22.477 --> 00:05:24.477
No, thanks.

00:05:24.477 --> 00:05:27.070
I’ll call my friend.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.560
Hello, Gong?

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.594
Come pick me up.

00:05:35.594 --> 00:05:38.594

You can’t go home yet because of me.

00:07:46.253 --> 00:07:49.910
Don’t worry about it. You can chill out here until dawn. This is my diner.

[10 Sep 22]

00:08:00.944 --> 00:08:03.880
Is it a beer can or a calendar?

00:08:06.347 --> 00:08:08.347
Both.

00:08:08.347 --> 00:08:11.160
It’s my daily reward.

00:08:13.999 --> 00:08:17.552
You must have a good day today. You rewarded yourself with it.

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:20.998
I guess.

00:08:23.136 --> 00:08:25.136
Actually, it’s to remind me that

00:08:25.833 --> 00:08:28.606
I can only afford one can of beer per day.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.350
What about you?

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:35.742
You are drunk like this. It must be a good day for you too.

00:08:40.392 --> 00:08:42.392
Just a small celebration for my job.

00:08:44.051 --> 00:08:46.051
Congrats.

00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:03.482
You may leave. I don’t want to trouble you.

00:09:03.482 --> 00:09:05.496
My friend should be here in a minute.

00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:12.000
Have you seen the news about a drunken young man being robbed for his cell phone?

00:09:14.567 --> 00:09:16.567
It was right here last week.

00:09:16.567 --> 00:09:19.056
The culprit is still at large.

00:09:20.492 --> 00:09:22.492
Really?

00:09:23.223 --> 00:09:25.223
How about this?

00:09:25.223 --> 00:09:28.239
I will give you a ride to the main street.

00:09:28.239 --> 00:09:30.825
You can tell your friend to meet you there.

00:09:32.364 --> 00:09:34.617
Are you the cell phone culprit?

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:38.451
A cell phone is not worth it.

00:09:38.451 --> 00:09:41.923
I can get a better price for kidneys.

00:09:46.553 --> 00:09:48.553
Are you drunk?

00:09:48.553 --> 00:09:52.240
Aren’t you afraid of getting stopped by the police for drunk driving?

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.837
Only one can. A breath alcohol test cannot detect it.

00:10:14.289 --> 00:10:16.289
For the Chicken rice I owe.

00:10:18.488 --> 00:10:24.000
And may I exchange the change for your reward tomorrow?

00:10:26.872 --> 00:10:30.198
You must be drunker than me.

00:10:33.029 --> 00:10:36.994

It’s the Moon Festival today.

00:11:28.351 --> 00:11:30.556
That’s why the moon is exceptionally beautiful.

00:11:31.212 --> 00:11:33.212
So nice.

00:11:35.213 --> 00:11:40.263
I used to see a woman on the moon.

00:11:43.448 --> 00:11:45.448
Isn’t it a rabbit?

00:11:46.995 --> 00:11:49.750
It’s my own imagination.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:52.202
And you believe that?

00:11:59.082 --> 00:12:01.082
Hey, Jim.

00:12:01.082 --> 00:12:02.713
Have you prayed?

00:12:03.512 --> 00:12:04.924
Not yet.

00:12:04.924 --> 00:12:06.709
Pray with me then.

00:12:19.411 --> 00:12:21.411
Thank you.

00:13:02.769 --> 00:13:04.769
It’s done.

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.620
Here’s a mooncake. Share some with him.

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:17.323
When you have kids, they will be lovely and good together.

00:13:17.323 --> 00:13:18.917
Share it.

00:13:20.439 --> 00:13:22.439
Thank you.

00:13:37.513 --> 00:13:39.513
Is it good?

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.590
Yes, it is.

00:15:44.665 --> 00:15:46.665
Are you okay to walk?

00:15:51.449 --> 00:15:53.449
I don’t think he is.

00:16:03.483 --> 00:16:05.483
His battery is dead.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:40.323
Hey.

00:16:40.608 --> 00:16:41.937
Come on.

00:16:43.797 --> 00:16:45.797
Come on.

00:16:45.797 --> 00:16:46.707
Slowly.

00:16:46.707 --> 00:16:48.432
I’m fine.

00:16:48.432 --> 00:16:50.831
No, you are not. You are so drunk.

00:16:51.331 --> 00:16:54.134
Easy. Watch your head.

00:16:57.182 --> 00:16:59.182
Come here.

00:17:03.305 --> 00:17:06.858

00:17:12.321 --> 00:17:15.191
Yes. Wait here.

00:17:21.457 --> 00:17:23.457
All right.

00:17:30.476 --> 00:17:32.476
Walk slowly.

00:17:38.886 --> 00:17:40.728
No. Not here.

00:17:40.728 --> 00:17:41.464
Come on.

00:17:41.464 --> 00:17:44.516
Take it easy.

00:17:57.345 --> 00:17:59.345
I’ll be right back. Wait here.

00:18:40.795 --> 00:18:42.795
Mister.

00:18:52.167 --> 00:18:54.167
Mister.

00:19:08.959 --> 00:19:10.959

00:19:22.718 --> 00:19:24.718
Hey.

Hey. Not this room.

00:19:36.661 --> 00:19:38.534
Come here.

00:19:38.851 --> 00:19:41.103
Sorry, Li Ming.

00:19:50.649 --> 00:19:52.649
Tell your son I’m sorry.

00:19:55.279 --> 00:19:57.279
Do I look that old?

00:19:57.973 --> 00:19:59.973
That’s my nephew.

00:20:01.209 --> 00:20:03.209
I don’t have a wife yet.

00:20:06.942 --> 00:20:08.942
I’m sure you know my preference.

00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:25.029
You are too wasted.

00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:27.208
Just crash here tonight.

00:20:39.382 --> 00:20:41.382
I’m already sober.

00:20:45.209 --> 00:20:47.209
But I don’t want to leave just yet.

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:51.910
It won’t be complicated, right?

00:20:55.414 --> 00:20:57.414
We don’t need to make it complicated.

00:20:58.646 --> 00:21:02.515
What happens tonight ends tonight.

00:21:11.363 --> 00:21:13.363
I’m not sure about that.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.500
Seriously.

00:22:37.032 --> 00:22:39.443
You don’t want to know me that much?

00:22:39.855 --> 00:22:42.099
I think it’s better for us this way.

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:07.242
You cute little thing.

00:24:11.624 --> 00:24:12.903
You are so cute.

00:24:14.813 --> 00:24:16.125
You like it, huh?

00:24:19.595 --> 00:24:20.569
May I know the name?

00:24:22.683 --> 00:24:23.551
Me or the cat?

00:24:26.195 --> 00:24:27.089
The cat.

00:24:28.586 --> 00:24:30.586
Jimbo. Call it Jimbo.

00:24:36.407 --> 00:24:38.407
Jimbo.

00:24:42.417 --> 00:24:44.417
You are so cute.

00:24:51.498 --> 00:24:52.616
Can I feed it?

00:24:53.569 --> 00:24:54.714
Sure?

00:24:56.071 --> 00:24:56.999
Can you open it for me?

00:25:02.621 --> 00:25:03.478
Thank you

00:25:04.837 --> 00:25:07.694
Jimbo, your treat.

00:25:10.492 --> 00:25:11.873
It’s yummy, isn’t it?

00:25:16.222 --> 00:25:18.222
You like it, huh?

00:25:28.791 --> 00:25:31.458
What should I call your dad, Jimbo?

00:25:36.251 --> 00:25:39.966
You are cuter. How could I not want to know your name first?

00:25:47.915 --> 00:25:48.939
Enough now, Jimbo.

00:25:52.512 --> 00:25:53.488
Come here.

00:26:14.715 --> 00:26:19.931
Comrades, Almost a Love Story: 365 days, I love only you

00:26:21.033 --> 00:26:23.033
It’s 3650 days.

00:26:23.266 --> 00:26:25.647
You cut their love 9 years short.

00:26:27.839 --> 00:26:29.577
Ah. You’re right.

00:26:29.714 --> 00:26:31.452
3650 days.

00:26:32.567 --> 00:26:38.759
Wow. I can't even remember the last movie I watched on DVD.

00:26:40.219 --> 00:26:41.318
It’s classic.

00:26:41.961 --> 00:26:45.363
But I haven't watched it in a long time. The disc is probably damaged.

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.564
I’m sure you can stream it online nowadays.

00:26:49.053 --> 00:26:50.021
It’s all right.

00:26:51.053 --> 00:26:52.299
I don’t feel like watching it anymore.

00:26:54.154 --> 00:26:57.154
Well, I’m going outside.

00:26:57.493 --> 00:26:59.714
Want me to drop you at the main street?

00:27:04.884 --> 00:27:06.431
I guess I have to bother you about that.

00:27:31.543 --> 00:27:34.019
You can wait and catch a ride over there.

00:27:37.979 --> 00:27:38.693
Okay.

00:27:50.442 --> 00:27:51.664
Seriously.

00:27:52.974 --> 00:27:54.714
You don’t want to know me that much?

00:27:59.116 --> 00:28:00.142
It’s not what you think.

00:28:01.381 --> 00:28:04.546
I think it’s better for us this way.

00:28:09.715 --> 00:28:10.572
Good luck.

00:28:41.157 --> 00:28:42.138
Mrs. Hong.

00:28:42.138 --> 00:28:42.943
Yes?

00:28:42.943 --> 00:28:43.826
Hi, Gaipa.

00:28:44.358 --> 00:28:46.358
I owe you this for last week’s order.

00:28:46.358 --> 00:28:47.319
Thanks.

00:28:47.319 --> 00:28:49.379
I thought you didn’t offer credit.

00:28:49.379 --> 00:28:51.489
It depends on who that customer is.

00:28:51.489 --> 00:28:55.514
He's been my customer for a very long long time.

00:28:55.514 --> 00:28:57.526
Or simply because he’s hot.

00:28:57.526 --> 00:28:59.460
That’s too, but only slightly.

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.114
Understandable.

00:29:04.041 --> 00:29:05.834
By the way, the chicken price will be higher from next week.

00:29:06.284 --> 00:29:08.784
The slaughterhouse said it was due to the rising fuel prices.

00:29:08.995 --> 00:29:13.639
I'm sick of being slammed whenever the price gets higher.

00:29:13.639 --> 00:29:15.298
Slam the government, not me.

00:29:15.298 --> 00:29:17.926
I’m just a vendor, not a Minister of Commerce.

00:29:17.926 --> 00:29:20.091
I can’t control the price of chicken.

00:29:20.091 --> 00:29:23.737
If the price increases again,

00:29:23.737 --> 00:29:27.597
I'm going to buy some land around here and open my own gas station.

00:29:27.597 --> 00:29:29.714
Please hire me as your gas staff.

00:29:29.714 --> 00:29:30.575
Are you sure?

00:29:30.575 --> 00:29:31.215
I am.

00:29:32.637 --> 00:29:34.637
The Sour Soup you gave me yesterday was very delicious.

00:29:34.637 --> 00:29:35.604
U…m..um.

00:29:36.009 --> 00:29:36.881
Um.

00:29:37.262 --> 00:29:40.769
If you like it, come and eat at our place anytime.

00:29:40.769 --> 00:29:42.664
We always have a full table of food.

00:29:42.664 --> 00:29:44.210
All your staff at the diner are welcome too.

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:45.152
I don’t want to trouble you.

00:29:45.152 --> 00:29:46.281
Don’t worry about it.

00:29:46.281 --> 00:29:49.511
You are famous now Uncle Jim.

00:29:49.511 --> 00:29:51.476
I saw you on the news.

00:29:51.476 --> 00:29:53.892
Customers must be flocking to your diner.

00:29:53.892 --> 00:29:57.358
Yes. That's why I have to order a few more chickens from Mrs. Hong.

00:29:57.358 --> 00:29:59.591
Good for you.

00:30:00.432 --> 00:30:02.432
Do you really want to order more chicken?

00:30:02.637 --> 00:30:07.400
If your diner is short-staffed, Gaipa can help you out.

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:09.410
Even though he has enough staff, I'm happy to help him.

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:10.195
See?

00:30:10.195 --> 00:30:11.054
Come on, Mrs. Hong.

00:30:11.054 --> 00:30:12.694
I have no budget to pay him.

00:30:12.905 --> 00:30:15.953
My son? Just one dish of food, that’s all it takes for him to be there.

00:30:15.953 --> 00:30:17.406
He can bring food himself, even.

00:30:17.406 --> 00:30:18.446
Mom!

00:30:18.446 --> 00:30:19.312
Isn’t it true?

00:30:19.312 --> 00:30:20.113
It is.

00:30:20.113 --> 00:30:21.053
Uncle Jim, hold on.

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:23.263
Hold on a sec.

00:30:23.263 --> 00:30:26.054
Here. Take these mooncakes.

00:30:26.892 --> 00:30:28.678
Here's to many customers for you.

00:30:28.678 --> 00:30:31.584
Mom bought way too many of these for the Moon Festival last night.

00:30:31.584 --> 00:30:34.151
It's just me and her. We can’t finish them all.

00:30:34.151 --> 00:30:34.686
Here.

00:30:39.069 --> 00:30:40.350
You may share it with Leng.

00:30:42.708 --> 00:30:43.713
Thank you so much, Gaipa.

00:30:44.241 --> 00:30:46.455
Share some with Leng too.

00:30:46.455 --> 00:30:48.786
- Sure. See you.
- See you.

00:30:48.786 --> 00:30:50.405
- 1 kg of chicken thighs, please.
- Good day, Mrs. Hong.

00:30:50.619 --> 00:30:51.132
Bye.

00:30:51.892 --> 00:30:52.983
- Chicken thighs, right?
- Yes.

00:30:53.428 --> 00:30:54.680
Mom, give me a bag.

00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:57.834
What are you looking at? The bag is right here.

00:30:59.547 --> 00:31:00.904
This dreamy boy.

00:31:16.827 --> 00:31:18.041
Can I sit here?

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:52.114
Here.

00:31:56.735 --> 00:31:58.248
I know old people like to eat ginger.

00:31:59.664 --> 00:32:00.719
It’s okay.

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:02.474
I’m already old.

00:32:09.854 --> 00:32:13.712
What about you? You seem to like eating ginger like old people.

00:32:15.159 --> 00:32:16.080
No.

00:32:19.557 --> 00:32:20.946
I like old people.

00:32:35.443 --> 00:32:36.426
I’m leaving first.

00:32:41.642 --> 00:32:42.659
Ma’am.

00:32:46.835 --> 00:32:48.525
Thank you. Please come again.

00:32:56.494 --> 00:32:59.280
This meal is on me.

00:32:59.974 --> 00:33:03.403
For your service last night, Uncle Chicken Rice.

00:34:08.165 --> 00:34:10.713
[Pick up the package at the building office for me.]

00:35:35.077 --> 00:35:36.410
Here’s your Chicken Rice.

00:35:40.186 --> 00:35:42.186
Here’s your chic… Oh shit!

00:36:18.628 --> 00:36:21.028
Beer is getting more and more expensive.

00:36:21.427 --> 00:36:23.160
At this rate, I may have to start brewing my own liquor.

00:36:36.852 --> 00:36:38.852
Do you want me to put dates on these cans now?

00:36:41.292 --> 00:36:42.040
Uncle Jim.

00:36:42.908 --> 00:36:43.626
Uncle Jim!

00:36:45.139 --> 00:36:46.011
What?

00:36:46.144 --> 00:36:48.585
You’re dreamy like a teen waiting for a text back from his lover.

00:36:48.585 --> 00:36:50.001
Do you want me to put a date on the beer?

00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:51.784
Leave that to me.

00:36:53.007 --> 00:36:56.057
You need to deliver this to Senior Sergeant Major Supoch’s house.

00:36:58.895 --> 00:37:00.406
Can you ask Li Ming to do it?

00:37:00.406 --> 00:37:02.870
I still owe his wife’s lotto money. I haven’t paid for it yet.

00:37:03.897 --> 00:37:05.330
Don't pull any tricks on this family.

00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:06.965
You have no idea what they're capable of.

00:37:07.346 --> 00:37:08.532
- I know.
- You could be in trouble.

00:37:09.346 --> 00:37:11.139
Give it to me. I’ll do it.

00:37:11.973 --> 00:37:14.596
How could you do it? It’s dangerous.

00:37:14.596 --> 00:37:15.587
You don't even have a driver's license yet.

00:37:17.592 --> 00:37:19.592
My friend doesn’t have a driver’s license

00:37:19.809 --> 00:37:21.809
and he rides his bike to school every day.

00:37:24.684 --> 00:37:27.507
I've never seen a police checkpoint on this road.

00:37:32.278 --> 00:37:35.813
Bye, my beloved bro. Drive safely.

00:37:36.511 --> 00:37:37.799
See you.

00:37:55.931 --> 00:37:57.375
Here’s your Chicken Rice.

00:38:12.426 --> 00:38:13.892
Here’s your Chicken Rice.

00:38:21.863 --> 00:38:23.151
Here’s your Chicken Rice.

00:38:33.911 --> 00:38:35.911
Here’s your chic… Oh shit!

00:38:46.475 --> 00:38:47.492
What the hell was that?

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.615
I don’t understand.

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:56.074
I can’t read sign language.

00:39:01.035 --> 00:39:03.084
No, it wasn’t me.

00:39:03.985 --> 00:39:05.807
What was that? I don’t get it. I can’t read it.

00:39:10.453 --> 00:39:11.763
I just put it here.

00:39:24.721 --> 00:39:26.155
Hey, Leng.

00:39:28.824 --> 00:39:30.102
Need my help?

00:39:33.101 --> 00:39:33.958
Why are you here?

00:39:34.625 --> 00:39:37.125
Can I have the diner’s spare key? I didn’t bring it with me last night.

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.150
Thank you.

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:43.106
Where’s Uncle Jim?

00:39:48.615 --> 00:39:50.326
Come home as soon as school is over.Come home as soon as school is over.

00:39:50.847 --> 00:39:52.192
I don’t want to hear your uncle nag.

00:39:53.638 --> 00:39:55.049
Let him.

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:57.429
He stops when he’s done with it.

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:00.039
Like uncle, like nephew.

00:40:04.738 --> 00:40:05.755
Hey, Leng.

00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:10.231
Officer Supoch's son is deaf?

00:40:11.876 --> 00:40:14.588
Ah…you mean Heart?

00:40:15.348 --> 00:40:17.126
He only became deaf a few years ago.

00:40:17.789 --> 00:40:19.385
It was caused by a disease. I'm not sure what it is.

00:40:21.499 --> 00:40:22.622
I see. How does he study then?

00:40:24.048 --> 00:40:25.112
I don’t think he goes to school now.

00:40:25.646 --> 00:40:27.138
I haven’t seen him for quite a while.

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:29.680
His parents don’t want him to go anywhere.

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:30.766
They probably don’t like the way people look at him.

00:40:35.058 --> 00:40:36.342
Do you know him?

00:40:38.634 --> 00:40:40.351
I see him when I bring his mother lotto orders.

00:40:40.744 --> 00:40:42.302
He looks kind of annoying, right?

00:40:44.206 --> 00:40:46.428
What happened? Did you have a fight with him?

00:40:49.467 --> 00:40:50.246
No.

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:54.804
Did you?

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:56.713
No. Nothing happened.

00:40:59.227 --> 00:41:01.328
Okay. Later then.

00:41:13.509 --> 00:41:17.534
Customers can order additional servings until they are satisfied.

00:41:18.106 --> 00:41:23.732
And now I’m with Mr. Jim, the owner of Moonlight Chicken.

00:41:23.732 --> 00:41:25.995
Good evening, Mr. Jim.

00:41:25.995 --> 00:41:29.732
Can you tell me what draws people here?

00:41:29.732 --> 00:41:33.067
After midnight, as I close my diner…

00:41:33.067 --> 00:41:36.670
Hey, Wen. Where were you last night?

00:41:42.905 --> 00:41:44.505
I didn't want to butt in your business.

00:41:44.804 --> 00:41:47.827
But Alan messaged me asking for you.

00:41:48.487 --> 00:41:51.021
He doesn’t know that I have read the message. What should I say to him?

00:41:51.288 --> 00:41:52.146
Hm?

00:41:57.095 --> 00:41:59.963
You don’t need to answer what you don’t know.

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:03.521
You have so many secrets, you sly kid.

00:42:04.947 --> 00:42:05.576
Hey, Gong.

00:42:05.576 --> 00:42:06.123
Yes?

00:42:06.279 --> 00:42:07.726
Have you ever had a one-night stand?

00:42:09.069 --> 00:42:10.192
I knew it.

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:12.471
I know now what happened to you last night.

00:42:13.564 --> 00:42:15.342
Yes, I have had it.

00:42:17.124 --> 00:42:21.126
So? Who initiated it? You or your one-night stand?

00:42:22.596 --> 00:42:23.630
We both took turns.

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:25.308
Really? That’s my slutty boy.

00:42:25.703 --> 00:42:28.148
A one-night stand is not a problem.

00:42:28.569 --> 00:42:31.348
What could be a problem is when it doesn’t end after one night.

00:42:32.598 --> 00:42:34.420
Be careful about it.

00:42:35.324 --> 00:42:36.710
Don't make it complicated.

00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:39.037
Avoid making affectionate eye contact during the action.

00:42:40.801 --> 00:42:44.091
You can go all out physically.

00:42:44.091 --> 00:42:46.366
Any position, any location, your choice.

00:42:47.014 --> 00:42:48.334
Just don’t show your inside feeling too much.

00:42:49.014 --> 00:42:50.050
I don’t think I can control that.

00:42:51.814 --> 00:42:52.766
Then don’t make eye contact.

00:42:55.347 --> 00:43:00.266
Don’t let your partner know what you are thinking or feeling.

00:43:00.266 --> 00:43:01.799
And don’t say anything tacky.

00:43:03.704 --> 00:43:06.171
“Oh, it’s really good. It feels so good.”

00:43:06.171 --> 00:43:07.542
Damn it, Gong!

00:43:12.462 --> 00:43:13.004
Hey.

00:43:14.072 --> 00:43:15.285
Then what do you think?

00:43:16.455 --> 00:43:19.367
As you are doing it, don’t you think that your partner may find it weird?

00:43:20.417 --> 00:43:22.862
Put on some act. No need to show that you are into it.

00:43:23.356 --> 00:43:26.157
Just nail and bail. Then part ways.

00:43:26.157 --> 00:43:27.617
It's a win-win situation.

00:43:29.055 --> 00:43:30.001
Let me tell you this.

00:43:30.757 --> 00:43:32.612
This kind of sex is not love.

00:43:33.353 --> 00:43:34.573
It's pure sex.

00:43:35.886 --> 00:43:40.604
If you give too much feeling or if one of you likes it and develops a bond,

00:43:41.266 --> 00:43:42.599
that will be complicated.

00:43:53.784 --> 00:43:54.574
Gong.

00:43:55.998 --> 00:43:57.030
Let’s go eat Chicken Rice.

00:43:58.387 --> 00:43:59.605
What’s with you?

00:43:59.605 --> 00:44:01.321
We just talked about sex.

00:44:01.321 --> 00:44:03.167
How could you invite me out to eat?

00:44:03.588 --> 00:44:04.686
No, I don’t want to eat it.

00:44:05.198 --> 00:44:06.545
Didn’t you just have it yesterday?

00:44:08.854 --> 00:44:11.143
You look sus. There must be something.

00:46:15.889 --> 00:46:17.889
[Mr. Wongsakorn Thunapakarn]

00:46:56.507 --> 00:46:57.926
I said I didn’t do it.

00:46:58.349 --> 00:47:01.244
Your son was startled when he saw me and dropped the bottle.

00:47:01.244 --> 00:47:03.453
- He said here he didn’t do it.
- It wasn’t me.

00:47:03.453 --> 00:47:04.788
He told me he didn’t.

00:47:04.788 --> 00:47:06.046
You friggin’ did it.

00:47:06.273 --> 00:47:07.471
Write it then.

00:47:07.471 --> 00:47:08.273
Stop.

00:47:42.054 --> 00:47:44.054
[Mrs. Jintana]

00:47:57.923 --> 00:48:01.267
When he brought Chicken Rice here yesterday,

00:48:01.267 --> 00:48:02.826
He played with a bottle of liquor.

00:48:02.826 --> 00:48:05.510
He was startled when my son appeared and dropped it on the floor.

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:07.551
Then he ran back home.

00:48:07.551 --> 00:48:09.756
I didn’t do that, Uncle Jim.

00:48:09.756 --> 00:48:11.026
We weren’t home.

00:48:11.026 --> 00:48:12.760
The liquor couldn’t drop itself.

00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:14.759
It wasn’t me.

00:48:17.587 --> 00:48:19.587
It was him.

00:48:20.248 --> 00:48:22.297
Hey. How could you put the blame on my son?

00:48:24.107 --> 00:48:26.107
I said I didn’t do it.

00:48:26.107 --> 00:48:29.152
Your son was startled when he saw me and dropped the bottle.

00:48:31.673 --> 00:48:35.161
That bottle was always there. Why would he want to grab it?

00:48:35.784 --> 00:48:37.724
And on the day that you came?

00:48:38.072 --> 00:48:39.885
Why don’t you hear it from him?

00:48:45.478 --> 00:48:47.478
He’s already told us everything.

00:48:51.657 --> 00:48:53.657
You dropped it.

00:48:55.032 --> 00:48:57.320
Tell them you tried to drink that liquor when they weren’t around.

00:48:57.728 --> 00:49:00.213
- He said here he didn’t do it.
- It wasn’t me.

00:49:00.213 --> 00:49:01.597
He told me he didn’t.

00:49:01.597 --> 00:49:03.246
You friggin’ did it.

00:49:03.718 --> 00:49:04.952
Stop.

00:49:06.448 --> 00:49:08.448
You use your deafness to get you off the hook, right?

00:49:08.448 --> 00:49:09.842
Don’t talk to my son like that.

00:49:09.842 --> 00:49:11.451
But I didn’t do it.

00:49:11.451 --> 00:49:12.725
Li Ming, stop!

00:49:13.909 --> 00:49:17.450
Please excuse us for a moment.

00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:18.765
Get up.

00:49:28.699 --> 00:49:30.699
Tell me everything.

00:49:30.699 --> 00:49:33.020
I already told everything.

00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:35.153
He was sneakily drinking his father's liquor.

00:49:35.153 --> 00:49:38.664
When he saw me, he was startled and dropped the bottle.

00:49:39.464 --> 00:49:42.267
So I placed the food on the counter and left.

00:49:42.507 --> 00:49:44.164
That's all there is to it.

00:49:45.972 --> 00:49:47.972
You should have told me about it first.

00:49:48.982 --> 00:49:50.703
What would I do that for?

00:49:50.703 --> 00:49:53.227
I did nothing wrong.

00:50:01.597 --> 00:50:04.461
What's the point of asking me if you're not going to believe me?

00:50:13.371 --> 00:50:16.787
Okay. You didn’t do it.

00:50:16.787 --> 00:50:19.351
But we have nothing to prove your innocence.

00:50:19.351 --> 00:50:21.827
If we keep arguing with them like that, it will never end.

00:50:22.163 --> 00:50:24.330
What evidence do you want?

00:50:24.330 --> 00:50:27.294
I said I did nothing wrong.

00:50:33.574 --> 00:50:36.366
I know. But if Officer Supoch refuses to drop the matter,

00:50:36.366 --> 00:50:37.937
you cannot win against him.

00:50:43.778 --> 00:50:45.778
Can you think of this incident as bad luck?

00:50:46.522 --> 00:50:48.558
What bad luck?

00:50:48.558 --> 00:50:50.380
I don’t get it.

00:50:50.628 --> 00:50:52.924
I did nothing wrong.

00:50:54.737 --> 00:50:56.362
Because we are poor?

00:50:57.034 --> 00:50:59.218
They can do anything at all to us?

00:51:03.027 --> 00:51:04.859
I don’t want to settle it at the police station.

00:51:05.435 --> 00:51:07.567
What exactly do you fear?

00:51:07.567 --> 00:51:09.705
Because he’s a police officer?

00:51:09.705 --> 00:51:12.155
So he has the power to do anything to us.

00:51:32.156 --> 00:51:34.156
To be honest, I don’t want to put you in this position.

00:51:34.156 --> 00:51:36.386
But this was one of his old liquor collections.

00:51:36.386 --> 00:51:39.248
It is worth over 10,000 baht.

00:51:41.264 --> 00:51:43.264
We don’t want you to think that we are mean.

00:51:45.032 --> 00:51:46.168
What do you think?

00:51:46.168 --> 00:51:47.881
Since we cannot find evidence.

00:51:47.881 --> 00:51:50.727
Say we split the responsibility 50/50.

00:51:50.727 --> 00:51:52.631
7000 baht, are you able to pay that?

00:52:00.687 --> 00:52:02.687
I will get money from Mrs. Hong’s money pool at the end of this month.

00:52:02.687 --> 00:52:04.875
I’ll pay you then.

00:52:04.875 --> 00:52:06.700
You don’t need to do that.

00:52:07.372 --> 00:52:09.372
I’ll pay you myself.

00:52:10.813 --> 00:52:13.964
I let you pay us in installments.

00:52:15.216 --> 00:52:17.216
Can I work for you instead?

00:52:37.988 --> 00:52:39.988
[We’re hiring daily waitstaff.]

00:53:02.338 --> 00:53:04.338
We have no Chicken Rice left.

00:53:08.928 --> 00:53:10.928
This has an owner.

00:53:11.144 --> 00:53:13.101
I’m not here to eat.

00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:17.388
I want a can of beer. Can I have that?

00:53:44.624 --> 00:53:46.624
Where’s everyone?

00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:49.473
They have gone home.

00:53:51.004 --> 00:53:54.132
You are the most chill Chicken Rice seller I know.

00:53:56.101 --> 00:53:58.101
You only saw me when I’m chilling.

00:53:59.454 --> 00:54:03.026
I'm a different man when my diner is packed with customers.

00:54:03.555 --> 00:54:06.712
What kind of person is that man?

00:54:08.839 --> 00:54:10.839
Just an ordinary seller

00:54:10.839 --> 00:54:14.056
with an oily face and a body that smells like boiled chicken.

00:54:15.134 --> 00:54:17.134
And I look so damn tired.

00:54:17.134 --> 00:54:19.066
You must see it yourself for once.

00:54:23.258 --> 00:54:25.258
I take that as your permission.

00:54:27.473 --> 00:54:31.177
Well. Aren’t you curious about me at all?

00:54:35.527 --> 00:54:37.527
Why are you here?

00:54:39.083 --> 00:54:41.083
If you're only here for a beer,

00:54:41.083 --> 00:54:43.353
I don't think you need to come all the way to my diner.

00:54:48.171 --> 00:54:50.171
I just want…

00:54:52.285 --> 00:54:54.285
to have a friend to drink beer with.

00:54:59.336 --> 00:55:01.336
I don't believe you have no friends.

00:55:03.015 --> 00:55:05.015
I do have some.

00:55:05.291 --> 00:55:09.258
But it's more about who I'd like to drink with.

00:55:42.027 --> 00:55:43.403
This is yours.

00:55:43.403 --> 00:55:45.093
You dropped it the other night.

00:55:56.968 --> 00:55:58.968
What if…

00:56:00.197 --> 00:56:02.197
I want to leave it here again?

00:56:07.768 --> 00:56:11.136
Didn’t I make it clear that what happened that night ended that night?

00:56:15.281 --> 00:56:17.281
Okay.

00:56:24.371 --> 00:56:28.722
What if I want to apply to be your waitstaff?

00:56:33.375 --> 00:56:35.375
I am available for an interview at your convenience.

00:56:35.855 --> 00:56:38.912
You may interview me as many times as you like.

00:56:42.382 --> 00:56:43.734
What’s your name?

00:56:43.734 --> 00:56:44.884
Wen.

00:56:46.202 --> 00:56:48.281
I thought you wouldn’t ask that.

00:56:48.281 --> 00:56:49.776
Okay, Wen.

00:56:51.438 --> 00:56:54.566
From now on, we are no strangers.

00:56:56.519 --> 00:56:58.519
So?

00:57:05.032 --> 00:57:09.839
Here is the rule for working with me.

00:57:10.631 --> 00:57:14.940
We must not do anything that strangers do.

00:57:17.712 --> 00:57:19.712
Like what?

00:57:21.266 --> 00:57:24.346
Like…what we did the other night.

00:57:30.215 --> 00:57:35.334
What should I call you, Boss?

00:57:37.189 --> 00:57:38.685
Jim.

00:57:39.841 --> 00:57:41.841
But people call me Uncle Jim.

[Wen - Moonlight Chicken - Temp staff]

Hi.

00:58:29.614 --> 00:58:31.361
Thanks.

00:58:32.021 --> 00:58:33.336
 Would you like some?

00:58:33.704 --> 00:58:35.023
No, I’m good.

00:58:35.023 --> 00:58:36.372
I’m cleaning it.

00:58:36.588 --> 00:58:38.274
I’m cleaning it.

00:58:38.767 --> 00:58:39.476
Shit!

00:58:40.712 --> 00:58:43.192
