Six months ago,
I begged you, I begged you

159
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,854
to please give me an option

160
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,939
I can put on a shelf
for 50 bucks.

161
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,650
And we are working on it.
I promise.

162
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,276
-Yeah.
-But, David, the only way

163
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,487
to stay ahead of the
competition is to come up with

164
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,364
toys that are too advanced
to replicate.

165
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,282
-(sighs)
-I know the tech on Petz seems

166
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,076
more complex than it needs
to be, but that's only because

167
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,119
I was using it as a launchpad
for something bigger.

168
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,081
In each Pet,
we installed a listening model

169

patterns among kids.

-(doorbell rings)

314
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,263
Hold on.

315
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,227
-Hi.

316
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,604
I'm Lydia.

317
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:40,731
Oh! The therapist?

318
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,441
Sorry, yeah.

319
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,318
Please come in.

320
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,782
And you must be Cady.

321
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,201
Hi. Look at you,
still in your pajamas.

322
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,870
GEMMA:
Yeah, we were just watching TV.

323
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,621
I see that.

324
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,627
So, how does this work?

325
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,796
I just need to observe
the two of you together

326
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,423
for half an hour,
40 minutes or so.

327
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,049
Oh. Okay.

328
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,634
Doing what, exactly?

329
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,970
Oh, just hanging out.

330
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,681
Maybe playing with some toys
or playing a game.

331
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,975
Hey, Cady, do you want to run
and grab some toys to play with?

332
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,476
I don't have any toys here.

333
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,811
I just unpacked a bunch
this morning.

334
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,188
I think they're just old.

335
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,814
I don't think
she plays with them anymore.

336
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,317
-What about these ones up here?
-Those aren't toys.

337
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,860
They're Aunt Gemma's
collectibles.

338
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,111
You're not supposed
to play with them.

339
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,072
(stammers) That's okay.

340
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,200
(chuckles)
We can play with them.

341
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,659
We can totally play with them.

342
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,828
Do you want to play with them?

343
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,663
You want to play-- Yeah.

344
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,040
Play with it. No big deal.

345
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,500
(rummaging)

346
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,211
(drawer closes)

347
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,358
There's a lever you have
to pull on the bottom...

348
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,860
Maybe, Gemma,
for the sake of the exercise,

349
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,487
we might let Cady lead.

350
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:10,988
Yeah, I'm just explaining
how it works.

351
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,240
Well, it's a toy.

352
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,408
I'm sure it's not
that complicated.

353
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,036
That's great, Cady.

354
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,455
Do you want to roll it
to Aunt Gemma?

355
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,127
It's just that this is not
what it was designed to do.

356
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,462
It does other things.

357
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,883
But, yeah, totally.

358
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,719
Let's just roll it on
the ground like a tennis ball.

359
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,721
Let's do that instead.

360
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,683
(sighing)

361
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,230
Uh, we'll do a few more
sessions with Cady initially,

362
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,731
but that can happen
at your office or school.

363
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,900
Oh, yeah. I haven't had time
to look into that yet.

364
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,529
Nicole was homeschooling her.
But, yeah, it's on my list.

365
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:55,449
Sorry, can I just ask, how
close were you and your sister?

366
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,078
Oh. I don't know.

367
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,580
But you wanted this, right?
To take custody?

368
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,457
Yeah, of course.

369
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,418
Okay, because
the father's parents have said

370
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,919
they're willing to take her
if you feel it's too much.

371
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,255
-Wait, did they contact you?
-It's no big deal, Gemma.

372
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,756
They're just trying
to be supportive.

373
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,258
If Nicole wanted Cady
to go to Jacksonville,

374
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,801
she would have said so.

375
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,803
But even so, I need to make
my own recommendations

376
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,139
to the court as to whether
or not this is a safe space,

377
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,516
so you're gonna need to make

378
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,394
one or two adjustments
in order for this to work.

379
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,564
Okay.

380
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,615
(phone beeping quietly)

381
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,254
Listen, Cady, um,

382
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:54,300
I have this project at work
that's kind of overdue,

383
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,802
and with all the time that
I had to take off last week,

384
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,597
I'm not really sure
I'm gonna get it done.

385
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:05,644
Anyway, it's not gonna take
longer than a couple of hours,

386
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,814
but if you could just
hold down the fort by yourself

387
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:12,234
for a little while,
that would help me so much.

388
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,779
You can use my iPad if you want.

389
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:18,949
You can FaceTime a friend
or play a game or something.

390
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,493
What about screen time?

391
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:21,660
Hmm?

392
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,538
How long before
I have to turn it off?

393
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,916
Oh, I don't care.
As long as you want.

394
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,418
I mean, I'm not
gonna be gone that long.

395
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,836
I'll just be down the hall.

396
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,672
And, uh, when I'm done,
we can go out somewhere.

397
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:37,176
We can go to a playground or...

398
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,096
get something to eat.

399
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,514

Cady?

Oh, Cady, I'm sorry.

405
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,804
Come here.

406
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:27,393
(sighs)

407
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,979
I'm not off to
a very good start here, am I?

408
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,024
What is this?
Did you draw a picture?

409
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,902
Oh, my God. This is amazing.

410
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,237
I'm still working on it.

411
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,572
-Tell me.
-(chuckles)

412
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,240
It was actually supposed to be

413
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,117
-a different animal
for each head. -Mm-hmm.

414
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:45,703
-CADY: Like, this one was
supposed to be a tiger. -Mm.

415
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,997
And this one was
supposed to be a grizzly bear,

416
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,207
-but I can never seem
to get the fur right. -Mm.

417
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,126
It's hard. I can relate.

418
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:55,754
I've actually been working with
some furry creatures myself.

419
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,132
Do you want to see?

420
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,717
Yeah?

421
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,386
So we're working on a version

422
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,512
of the Purrpetual Pet
that's cheaper.

423
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,098
We still want it to be fun.

424
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,893
So, what do you think?

425
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,729
(Cady sighs)

426
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,439
Yeah.

427
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,191
What's that?

428
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,109
Oh.

429
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,360
That's Bruce.

430
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,529
Is he a toy?

431
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,823
Yeah, kinda.
He's a proxy robot.

432
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,242
I built him
when I was in college.

433
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:29,288
-Why doesn't he have a face?
-Yeah, I know what you mean.

434
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,416
It's a pretty obvious
design flaw.

435
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,336
Okay, hold on.
Let's see what we have.

436
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,134
Let's see about this.

437
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,345
-How's that?
-(laughs)

438
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:46,305
Would you maybe want
to talk to him?

439
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,766
Yes.

440
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:50,768
Okay.

Hey, Cady. What's up?

443
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:07,493
-(laughs)
-Give me five.

444
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,914
Oh, come on.
You can do better than that.

445
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,168
Ouch, girl. Not so hard.

446
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,045
(chuckles) How does he work?

447
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:21,006
Are you sure you want to know?
It might freak you out.

448
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,175
I won't get freaked out.

449
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,344
(inhales deeply) Okay.

450

(electronic chiming)

451
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,891
Let's see what we've got here.

452
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,354
Okay.
These are stereoscopic cameras.

453
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,565
That is a laser. That's radar.

454
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:40,359
These are bump sensors,
so he can tell the difference

455
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,027
between a human
and a hard surface.

456
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:46,156
And this little block right here
is where all of his thoughts go.

457
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,825
-It's his brain?
-Yeah.

458
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:50,578
And this is a spectrometer,
which means he can even smell.

459
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:52,621
I can't believe you made this.

460
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,540
Yeah. He's pretty cool.

461
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,041
But the problem
with toys like Bruce

462
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,376
is that they're so expensive,

463
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,670
and most kids
can't afford to have one.

464
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,380
If I had a toy like Bruce,

465
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,049
I don't think I'd ever need
another toy again.

That's a great question, Cady.

not replace them.

634
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,364
-(sighs) -I mean, if you're
having M3gan tuck Cady in

635
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,533
and read her a bedtime story,
then when are you ever

636
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,410
spending time with her
or even talking with her?

637
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,371
I don't really think
this is any of your business.

638
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:16,166
Well, it is.

639
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,168
If you're spending less time
with your child

640
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:20,295
as a result of M3gan,
that is something

641
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:23,256
-we should be aware of.
-She's not my child.

642
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,177
Look, you know how hard

643
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:28,720
I've been working
on this presentation.

644
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,305
As soon as it's over and
the board agrees to proceed,

645
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,057
then we can establish
some kind of balance.

646
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:34,059
But for now, it's important
that Cady and M3gan spend

647
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,393
as much time
as possible together.

648
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,645
And by the way,

649
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:38,146
I don't think it's having
detrimental effects,

650
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,481
because she's the happiest
she's been

651
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:40,857

daughter of
Nicole and Ryan James,

657
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,576
killed in a collision
on Interstate 84

658
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,994
outside of Oregon.

659
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,412
Why is she doing that?

660
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,164
Shit, she's still
paired with Cady.

661
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,083
You didn't code in
parental controls?

662
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,876
I didn't have time to implement
them before we went live.

663
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,086
Hold on.

664
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,504
M3gan, if you have
data requests,

665
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:04,422
you have to engage
with the protocols.

666
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,133
I don't have a framework
to speak with Cady

667
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:07,425
on the subject of death.

668
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,094
Yes, I know.
We're looking into it.

669
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:11,054
Gathering auxiliary
Internet data on death.

DAVID:
Every interactive toy

792
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,363
that's ever been made

793
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:29,701
has been a variation
on the same basic formula:

794
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,911
a series of
preprogrammed responses

795
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,038
initiated by
the push of a button.

796
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:37,041
Never before in the history
of these products

797
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,668
has there been a talking doll

798
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:42,046
you could actually have
a conversation with.

799
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,090
But what if there was a toy

800
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:48,595
that did have genuine,
spontaneous response,

801
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:50,722
that had a mind all of its own,

802
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:54,851
that looked and behaved
exactly like a real child?

803
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:58,688
I mean, (chuckles) a toy
like that wouldn't come cheap.

804
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:03,401
But as of next year, it's gonna
be the only toy that matters.

805
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,819
Ladies and gentlemen,

806

she's the apex
of 21st-century technology

00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:11,326
wrapped up
in four feet of silicone.

808
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:14,162
And her name is M3gan.

809

(people whispering, murmuring)

813
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,513
So, how would you
like to help me

814
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:35,433
make a flower decoration
with nothing more than

815
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,019
some colored paper
and a rubber band?

816
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,438
(crying)

817
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,192

(crying continues)

819
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:51,449
Why are you sad, Cady?

820
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,950
Is it your arm?

821
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,952
Is it still sore?

822
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:58,456
Then what is it?

823
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:04,921
It's just that every day I
wake up in this strange house,

824
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:07,465
and I remember
that my parents are dead.

825
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,426
It's like it's happening
all over again.

826
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,178
I miss them so much.

827
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:15,640
I'm worried that I'll forget
all the things we did together.

828
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,267
That one day I'll be
looking at pictures of my mom

829
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,186
like she's some stranger.

830
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,866
Tell me something
about your mom,

831
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:36,160
something that makes you happy.

832
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,164
I don't know.

833
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,459
I can't think of one thing.

834
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,670
Just try.

835
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:51,801
One time, she found
a cockroach in my schoolbag.

836
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:55,680
She was upset 'cause
I didn't eat my sandwiches.

837
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:59,892
And then all of a sudden,
this thing crawls up her wrist,

838
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:02,311
and she just started screaming
like a maniac

839
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,188
and ran out of the house.

840

841
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:08,067
That was pretty funny.

842

Okay, so that's a memory
you won't ever forget.

843
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:13,865
What do you mean?

844
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:17,034
I mean I'm keeping it for you.

So, what do you think?

00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:42,078
I think the world's
about to shift on its axis.

-Yes. -But listen, if we want

872
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,790
we're gonna have to move fast.

873
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,542
That means no leaks.
We need to launch this

874
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:49,418
before anyone
can steal it from us.

875
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:50,795
So let me make a pitch.

876
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:52,296
We do a live stream
in two weeks.

877
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,173
That way, we can get
the presale vouchers

out before Christmas.

879

How ready is she?

880
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,302
Will she hold up
to a public demonstration?

881
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,137
Uh, I'd like to do
a little more testing,

882
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,431
but, yeah, I-I think
I can make that work.

883
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,976
All right. Let's do it.

884
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,602
And, David,
I think we need to get Gemma

885
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,312

886
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,647
You bet.

Uh, wait, wait, uh,
wh-why-why is that?

888
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,067
Because as of right now,

889
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,152
she's the most valuable asset
this company has,

890
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:19,073
and I think she might want to
be renegotiating her contract.

Any thoughts you have are okay.

941
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:41,215
Or maybe you don't have
any specific thoughts.

942
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,300
Maybe it's more of a feeling.

943
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,346
Like anger?

944
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:49,223
Or confusion?

945
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:54,270

958
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,521
Yeah, that's essentially
how M3gan works.

959
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,316
She has to be paired
with a child in order to learn.

960
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:43,402
But M3gan's actually been
pretty instrumental

get over the loss.

962

Right.

Do you know anything
about attachment theory?

965
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:58,459
When a child loses a parent,
they look to form attachments

966
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:00,920
with the next person
that comes into their life.

967
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,714
The person that's gonna provide
love and support

968
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,592
and serve as a behavioral model.

Which, in an ordinary
situation, would be you, right?

970

But you've created
a toy that's so real,

971
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:17,061
it's possible that
Cady might not see her as a toy

972
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:20,606
but as a primary caregiver.

973
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:23,984
I guess I just don't quite see
what the end goal is here.

974
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:26,278
If you make a toy
that's impossible to let go of,

975
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:30,491
then how do you ever expect
a child to grow?

976

As remarkable as she is--
and-and she is remarkable--

977
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:38,666

connections with this doll

Very good job.

You have to eat the toppings,

You just did the one thing
I asked you not to do.

982
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,103
Research shows that
if you force a child

983
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:01,021
to eat vegetables,
then they'll be less likely

984
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,773

-Is that so?
-Yes.

986
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,652
Experts say
the preferred method is

987
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:07,945
to give your child the choice.

988
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,280

It's called the division

So we need to talk about school.

I know, and I'm-I'm not saying
that she was wrong.

994
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:23,335
I'm learning faster with M3gan
than I ever have before.

995
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:25,254
We're already on
fourth-grade math.

996
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:27,256
GEMMA: But it's about
more than just grades, Cady.

997
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:29,466
It's about developing
social skills,

998
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,468
and that is something
that you can only get

999
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,012
from spending time
around other kids.

1000

It's kind of

00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,562
You get to learn outdoors.

1004
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:43,856
And it's just for kids
who are exactly like you,

1005
00:49:43,856 --> 00:49:46,609
kids who think outside the box.

that's not possible.

God, no. No, no, no.

1268
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:11,723
I only mention it 'cause
we figured it was an accident.

1269
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:13,183
Then I found the kid's ear
up this bank

1270
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:15,143
like 200 yards from
where he was killed.

clean off. (chuckles)

Sorry, I shouldn't laugh.
The point is,

as a potential homicide.

But even though she knows

1417
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:02,842
everything there is to know
about the world,

1418
01:11:02,842 --> 01:11:05,595
she's still more interested in
what I think about it.

1419
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:07,597
I like how she makes me laugh.

1420
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:10,933
She comes up with the
craziest things, oh, my gosh.

1421
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:16,147
But I think what I love most
about M3gan is that,

1422
01:11:16,147 --> 01:11:18,691
when she looks at me,
it's like...

1423
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:21,444
I'm the only thing
that matters to her.

1424
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,322
Kind of the way Mom used to.

1425
01:11:24,322 --> 01:11:25,823
DAVID (over screen):
Look at that face.

1426
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:28,618
That kid's not just surviving.
She's thriving.

1427
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:30,703
Now, imagine what a toy
like M3gan could do

1428
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:33,956
for hundreds of thousands
of kids all across the world.

1429
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:36,792
Even the ones
who don't have dead parents.

1430
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:39,629
-CADY: I want to see M3gan now!
-(clattering)

1431
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:42,048
Okay, Cady, look,
I know that you're upset,

1432
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:43,925
but there are ways
that we can work through this--

1433
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:44,967
Oh, my God. Okay.

1434
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:46,302
Cady, that's enough.

1435
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:48,262
Stop that right now. Stop it.

1436
01:11:48,262 --> 01:11:49,680
Let go! (gasps)

1437
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:53,935
LYDIA:
Cady.

1438
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:58,606
It's okay.
Could you give us a minute?

1439
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:06,447
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

1440
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:09,617
It's just--
I get so crazy without M3gan.

1441
01:12:09,617 --> 01:12:12,578
She always knows
just what to say.

1442
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:15,665
You made her real good,
Aunt Gemma.

1443
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:17,667
Can you let me see her?

1444
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:19,335
Just for like ten minutes?

1445
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:21,003
Cady, I don't think
that's a good idea.

1446
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:23,506
But if something's broke,
you don't just throw it away.

1447
01:12:23,506 --> 01:12:24,882
You fix it, right?

1448
01:12:26,384 --> 01:12:27,802
Why did you do this

1449
01:12:27,802 --> 01:12:29,428
if you were just gonna
take her away from me?

1450
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:30,846
Because I thought
she would help.

1451
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:32,098
She does help.

1452
01:12:32,098 --> 01:12:34,100
When M3gan's around,
I don't feel like this.

1453
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:36,644
But you should feel like this.

1454
01:12:36,644 --> 01:12:40,523
Cady, you lost your parents.

1455
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:43,317
The worst thing

1456
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:47,154
that could've happened to you
in this world happened.

1457
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:49,198
And it is so unfair,

1458
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:53,953
and there is nothing anyone
can say to make sense of it.

1459
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:55,329
Not even M3gan.

1460
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:57,790
I am so sorry.

1461
01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:00,001
I should've talked to you
about what happened.

1462
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:01,377
I didn't know what to say,

1463
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:03,087
so I did the only thing
I knew how to do.

1464
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:05,965
But she's not a solution.
She's just a distraction.

1465
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:10,428
I can't promise you that
these feelings you're feeling

1466
01:13:10,428 --> 01:13:13,014
are ever gonna go away.

1467
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:16,809
But I can promise you
that you'll get through it.

1468
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:18,394
We both will.

1469
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:22,898
I just wish
I could see them again.

1470
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:24,567
Yeah.

1471
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:28,404
I do, too.

1472
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,573
You know I made a promise
to your mom

1473
01:13:30,573 --> 01:13:33,909
that if anything happens,
I would be there for you.

1474
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:38,748
You are all that matters
to me now.

1475
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:43,085
Let's just go home, okay?

1476
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:46,255
But what about M3gan?

1477
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:48,758
What about the launch?

1478
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:50,801
DAVID: I don't
even know what I'm looking at.

1479
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:52,678
I mean, we've been touting this

1480
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:55,681
as the single biggest product
release of the 21st century.

1481
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:57,433
Right now, it looks like
an AA meeting.

1482
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:58,851
SHELLEY:
Well, I only invited the staff.

1483
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:00,978
You said it was
an online launch.

1484
01:14:00,978 --> 01:14:02,438
You cannot be serious.

1485
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,899
Shelley, you need
to fill this atrium.

1486
01:14:04,899 --> 01:14:07,401
Probably get you, like,
another 60, 70 people.

1487
01:14:07,401 --> 01:14:09,570
No! You need to fill this space.

1488
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:11,697
There shouldn't be any ambiguity

1489
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:13,991
over what a historic occasion
this is.

1490
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:15,451
KURT:
Yeah.

1491
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,036
And, you know,
I think it would be really cool

1492
01:14:17,036 --> 01:14:19,622
if we had some little kids
up there and stuff.

1493
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:22,291
What? No, I don't want
any kids onstage.

1494
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:23,626
No. I mean, but maybe

1495
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:24,835
if we could get
some little kids that...

1496
01:14:24,835 --> 01:14:26,462
-(sighs)
-I mean, not, like, a whole lot.

1497
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:29,048
It's just to get
a sense of, um--

1498
01:14:29,048 --> 01:14:30,466
Well, 'cause, you know,

1499
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:31,801
that music video
from Michael Jackson...

1500
01:14:31,801 --> 01:14:33,886
You know
what you could do, Kurt,

1501
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:36,138
that would really benefit
this discussion?

1502
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:37,932
Is if you could head out
those double doors,

1503
01:14:37,932 --> 01:14:40,434
take the elevator
to the first floor

1504
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:41,686
and get me a kombucha!

1505
01:14:41,686 --> 01:14:43,979
-Could you do that?
-Sure.

1506
01:14:45,356 --> 01:14:47,650
And where the hell is Gemma?

1507

Where are you?

1512

I'm with Cady.
I'm taking her home.

1513
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,420
-Oh, God. Is she okay?
-Yeah.

She's fine.

is hypothetical,

1517

through with this, right?

stopped working.
