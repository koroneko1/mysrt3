What if you've been hounding me for like over a year?

I'm serious. An actual lipstick carousel?

00:02:18,242 --> 00:02:19,677
I found it on a state sale.

16
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,847
I told you it was gonna be a blessing to move up here.

17
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,016
I still need to check the state of the motor

but it's in pretty good shape.

19

I'll text you some pictures.

20
00:02:28,486 --> 00:02:31,289
Or, you know, you could use it as an excuse

21
00:02:31,322 --> 00:02:32,790
to come up and see the house.

22
00:02:32,823 --> 00:02:35,927
Well, you got to come up and visit sometime.

I'm telling you, this house...

something about it just drew me to it.

Yeah. I tried calling you.

Oh yeah. No, sorry, we just--

00:03:56,107 --> 00:03:58,609
The amount of rock that I can see in the sub floor--

50
00:03:58,643 --> 00:04:00,611
The drain's probably been leaking for years.

51
00:04:00,645 --> 00:04:02,713
And they didn't find any of that in the inspection?

52
00:04:02,747 --> 00:04:04,215
CONSTRUCTION SUPERVISOR: They probably missed it.

53
00:04:04,248 --> 00:04:06,050
But look we can handle the re-pipe.

54
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,785
But you're gonna need a structural engineer

55
00:04:07,818 --> 00:04:09,020
to take a look at that floor.

56

00:04:10,755 --> 00:04:12,590

-Thanks. -I'll get on that.

Yeah, so that's my day.

So, tell me how did you two meet?

144
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,645
We met the old-fashioned way.

145
00:09:34,678 --> 00:09:35,546
-Yeah... -We met at a bar.

146
00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:36,880
Right.

147
00:09:36,914 --> 00:09:39,183
I was out one night having drinks with friends

148
00:09:39,216 --> 00:09:42,219
and I spot this guy alone, sitting at the bar.

149
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:44,054
I just got in the country and so I was...

150
00:09:44,088 --> 00:09:47,024
So, he finally works up the nerve to come over

151
00:09:47,057 --> 00:09:48,192
and he offers to buy me a drink.

152
00:09:48,225 --> 00:09:50,327
Well, I actually bought a round of drinks for her

153
00:09:50,361 --> 00:09:51,428
and her mates.

154

-It was all a trap.... -[Mrs. Whittier chuckles]

155
00:09:52,763 --> 00:09:55,532
Which was a rather steep investment on my part

156
00:09:55,566 --> 00:09:56,533
-during that time. -Oh, okay.

157
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:57,801
Apparently, I was worth the splurge.

158
00:09:57,835 --> 00:09:59,670
DANIEL: Well, apparently. I was a little tipsy.

159
00:09:59,703 --> 00:10:01,105
-And we get to talking. -That's right,

160
00:10:01,138 --> 00:10:03,574
and she tells me about her antiques business, right?

00:10:03,607 --> 00:10:04,742
Hm-mm.

162
00:10:04,775 --> 00:10:06,677
And, he mentions this old watch he has

163
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,579
and he's been meaning to get it restored.

164
00:10:08,612 --> 00:10:10,447
So, I said I'd take a look at it.

165
00:10:10,481 --> 00:10:12,182
Which was a lie, of course.

166

-There was no watch. -No watch.

So, I spend the next 24 hours scouring all of lower Manhattan

You're in the hospital.

264

You suffered what we call a partial placenta abruption.

00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:55,265
Abruption? What's that?

269
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:57,267
It's when the placenta becomes partially detached

270
00:14:57,301 --> 00:14:58,635
from the uterine wall.

271
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:00,304
Is it dangerous?

272
00:15:00,337 --> 00:15:03,707
Well, it can be life-threatening if the placenta fully separates

273
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,811
but as you can see, the tear appears fairly minimal.

And so far the situation seems to be stabilized.

Bleeding stopped

and your baby's got a good strong heartbeat.

277
00:15:16,486 --> 00:15:20,123
However, it is standard practice to exercise caution.

278

What does that mean?

279
00:15:24,895 --> 00:15:27,464
It means I want you on bed rest.

280
00:15:27,497 --> 00:15:30,500
Strict bed rest for the duration of your pregnancy.

281

No driving, no lifting, no cooking.

Other than the occasional trip to the bathroom,

283
00:15:36,673 --> 00:15:38,375
you need to be in bed idle.

DR. MEADOWS: I know it's not ideal.

287
00:15:47,184 --> 00:15:49,319
But we don't want you going into early labor.

288
00:15:49,353 --> 00:15:52,055
Anything before 37 weeks is considered preterm

289
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:54,224
and can put the baby at risk of low birth weight

or respiratory distress.

00:15:59,896 --> 00:16:01,064
I would strongly recommend

294

putting any major projects on hold,

DR. MEADOWS: To avoid preterm labor,

305
00:16:33,597 --> 00:16:35,599
you need to follow a few simple rules.

306
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:39,269
One, you need to remain in bed 24 hours a day.

307
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,372
Two, you're allowed brief trips to the bathroom

308
00:16:42,406 --> 00:16:45,108
and one ten-minute bath every three days,

309
00:16:45,142 --> 00:16:46,243
no more.

310
00:16:47,444 --> 00:16:49,780
And finally, the most important rule.

311
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,416
It's crucial that you avoid stress.

312
00:16:53,517 --> 00:16:55,352
Anything that raises your blood pressure

313
00:16:55,385 --> 00:16:57,754
not only endangers the health of your child,

314
00:16:57,788 --> 00:17:00,057
but could re trigger the mental dissociation

315
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,792
you experienced after your last pregnancy.

316

to a more significant psychological break.

668

she's seeing your previous child.

670
00:47:51,306 --> 00:47:52,974
The medication should alleviate her symptoms,

but if they do persist,

672
00:47:55,977 --> 00:47:57,212

Right. But did you call her references?

Did you do a background check? Anything?

Pregnancy was going alone fine

An incompetent cervix. That's what they told me.

799

I managed to conceive three more times

kept... asking myself what I'd done to deserve it.

803
01:00:37,004 --> 01:00:39,407
And I remembered a story I'd heard as a child.

804
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,876
About a family who lived up around this lake.

805
01:00:43,477 --> 01:00:44,412
Three small kids,

806
01:00:45,579 --> 01:00:46,747
mother pregnant with the fourth.

807
01:00:48,215 --> 01:00:51,419
She and her husband were on the way to the hospital

808
01:00:51,452 --> 01:00:54,522
in early labor when their car skidded on some ice.

809
01:00:54,555 --> 01:00:55,823
Crashed into a tree.

810
01:00:57,825 --> 01:01:00,294
The impact taking the life of their unborn daughter.

811
01:01:01,962 --> 01:01:03,898
The woman was inconsolable.

812
01:01:03,931 --> 01:01:06,100
Every night, her cries could be heard

813
01:01:06,133 --> 01:01:07,868
around the lake lamenting the loss

814
01:01:07,902 --> 01:01:10,104
of her baby girl.

815
01:01:10,137 --> 01:01:13,107
She didn't eat, barely left the house.

816
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:15,142
The faces of her three living children

817
01:01:15,176 --> 01:01:20,281
just reminded her how she'd failed as a mother.

818
01:01:20,314 --> 01:01:22,983
How she could never truly protect them.

819
01:01:25,019 --> 01:01:28,022
And eventually, it just became too much.

820
01:01:28,756 --> 01:01:30,124
She took her own life?

821
01:01:37,431 --> 01:01:41,869
That story reminded me that I wasn't alone.

822
01:01:43,471 --> 01:01:45,506
That mothers have been bearing the burden of loss

823

since the beginning of time.

824
01:01:48,909 --> 01:01:50,911
But it's what you do with that pain,

825
01:01:50,945 --> 01:01:52,213
that defines you.

826
01:01:55,149 --> 01:01:57,985
A mother's grief is a powerful thing.

827
01:02:00,654 --> 01:02:02,490
You either learn to make peace with it

828
01:02:02,523 --> 01:02:03,791
or it eats you alive.
