00:37:17,292 --> 00:37:19,932
(IN FARSI):

530
00:37:20,991 --> 00:37:24,203
There is no aviation safety issue

531
00:37:24,328 --> 00:37:28,832
other than a military act
against a civilian aircraft.

532
00:37:28,957 --> 00:37:32,920
There was no technical
issue with the airplane.

533
00:37:33,045 --> 00:37:37,007
There was no air traffic
issue at the airport.

534
00:37:37,132 --> 00:37:42,054
There was no radar or
air traffic control issue.

535
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:46,058
There was no technical
or air safety problem.

536
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:51,980
The only issue was that a military,
security system...

537
00:37:52,105 --> 00:37:55,442
Positions an air defence battery
near the airport...

538
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:58,612
And that is where our story begins.

539
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:01,445
<i>(CHAMPAGNE):
Iran has a path to choose.</i>

540
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:06,142
Either they go to the path of
transparency and accountability.

541
00:38:06,143 --> 00:38:07,484
Taking full responsibility.

542
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:10,311
When you say to the world
you take full responsibility,

543
00:38:10,312 --> 00:38:12,523
that comes with consequences.

544
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:13,252
They submit to investigations.

545
00:38:13,377 --> 00:38:17,005
We have a right to be present...

546
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:20,175
in any examination
of the black boxes.

547
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,720
We will not surrender them to others.

548
00:38:24,095 --> 00:38:26,162
Once you’ve had a situation

549
00:38:26,163 --> 00:38:30,936
where they deny that there was
any military involvement.

550
00:38:30,937 --> 00:38:33,609
<i>And then, they reversed
their position.</i>

551
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:36,304
<i>Then they bulldozed
the crash site.</i>

552
00:38:36,305 --> 00:38:38,548
<i>Then they delayed
the black boxes.</i>

553
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:42,112
<i>And then, they intimidated
the families and harassed them.</i>

554
00:38:42,113 --> 00:38:47,458
And Canada repeatedly asked
for accredited status

555
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:48,591
in the investigation.

556
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:52,386
And Iran consistently
ignored that request.

557
00:38:52,387 --> 00:38:54,498
You’ve got that pattern
of behaviour.

558
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:56,533
(BABAK): You asked
for accredited status.

559
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:57,864
What would it have given you?

560
00:38:57,865 --> 00:38:59,602
I could have suggested
they do things,

561
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:00,735
suggest they release
information.

562
00:39:00,736 --> 00:39:03,331
I could’ve had access
to much more information.

563
00:39:03,332 --> 00:39:05,333
I could’ve asked
for other information

564
00:39:05,334 --> 00:39:07,401
<i>and they had to technically
give it to me.</i>

565
00:39:07,402 --> 00:39:08,809
<i>But limited to that expert role,</i>

566
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:12,010
and limited to just
requesting accredited
representative status,

567
00:39:12,011 --> 00:39:14,452
I was in this weird
diplomatic holding.

568
00:39:14,453 --> 00:39:17,653
In spite of the letters
that I sent personally

569
00:39:17,654 --> 00:39:19,083
to the head of the AIB

570
00:39:19,084 --> 00:39:21,184
and later on
to the Deputy Minister

571
00:39:21,185 --> 00:39:22,955
of the Civil Aviation
Organization.

572
00:39:22,956 --> 00:39:26,728
<i>In spite of our asking
for a higher status,</i>

573
00:39:26,729 --> 00:39:28,092
<i>in fact, they never answered me.</i>

574
00:39:28,093 --> 00:39:29,566
(BABAK): You were there
for four days.

575
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:31,293
I think it was
a little more than that.

576
00:39:31,294 --> 00:39:32,163
(BABAK): How many times

577
00:39:32,164 --> 00:39:34,263
did you ask
for accredited status?

578
00:39:34,264 --> 00:39:35,770
- Every day.
- (BABAK): Every day?

579
00:39:35,771 --> 00:39:38,432
I mean, it was
a regular conversation.

580
00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:42,049
What does that mean? How much longer?

581
00:39:38,433 --> 00:39:41,337
(IN FARSI):

582
00:39:42,174 --> 00:39:45,093
Negotiations can't take forever.

583
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:48,552
There was a clear
promise from Iran to cooperate,

584
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,180
in terms of investigation.

585
00:39:50,181 --> 00:39:51,753
And I think we do not
see enough.

586
00:39:51,754 --> 00:39:54,558
We should do so much better
on that.

587
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:55,757
And I think such a delay

588
00:39:55,758 --> 00:39:58,793
is a sign of disrespect
towards the grieving families.

589
00:39:58,794 --> 00:40:02,192
We are in close touch
with the association of families

590
00:40:02,193 --> 00:40:05,030
of the flight victims
here in Canada.

591
00:40:05,031 --> 00:40:08,836
And I know
that Minister Champagne
spoke to them yesterday.

592

going through without closure.

does this bring
any sort of closure for you?

604
00:40:50,912 --> 00:40:55,509
Not at all. This report
just raises more questions.

605
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:58,182
We have families from the UK,

606
00:40:58,183 --> 00:41:02,516
from Sweden, from Afghanistan,
Iran and Canada.

607
00:41:02,517 --> 00:41:04,628
And all of them are destroyed

608
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:07,598
with this delay
and with this mockery

609
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:12,570
of the conventions and
all the regulations by Iran.

610
00:41:12,571 --> 00:41:17,300
I think the Iranian officials,
they just try to shape

611
00:41:17,301 --> 00:41:19,368
the public opinion about that

612
00:41:19,369 --> 00:41:22,680
and find a way
to obstruct justice.

613
00:41:23,406 --> 00:41:27,046
The inconsistencies,
inaccuracies and gaps

614
00:41:27,047 --> 00:41:31,589
in the official explanation
create a maximum of confusion.

615
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:38,057
And thus, seem to be contrived
to mislead in one of more ways.

616
00:41:38,058 --> 00:41:43,260
As for the admitted mistake,
these indicate a reckless,

617
00:41:43,261 --> 00:41:44,998
if not criminal disregard,

618
00:41:44,999 --> 00:41:48,870
for standard procedures
and principle of precaution,

619
00:41:48,871 --> 00:41:52,005
which should have been
implemented to the fullest,

620
00:41:52,006 --> 00:41:58,473
<i>given the circumstances
and the location of the unit.</i>

621
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:04,886

also point to a deep failure
of the chain of command,

00:42:04,887 --> 00:42:07,218
both civilian and military.

623
00:42:07,219 --> 00:42:10,694
Indeed, on the basis
of the information received,

624
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:14,390
one may even question
whether there was an order

625
00:42:14,391 --> 00:42:18,702
or implicit encouragement
by the chain of command

626
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:22,805
to the crew on the ground,
to apply lethal force,

627
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:26,039

standard procedures

628

From their leader to some petty officer.

702
00:48:09,348 --> 00:48:12,059
Saying it was a spy plane,
we are happy we shot it down.

703
00:48:12,768 --> 00:48:16,730
We want to stop a big war...

704
00:48:16,855 --> 00:48:20,984
with a war.

705
00:48:22,945 --> 00:48:25,781
This is our only option.

706
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:32,079
We had to surprise the enemy.

707
00:48:33,372 --> 00:48:36,708
We had to deceive the enemy.

708
00:48:37,376 --> 00:48:42,840
We had to be prepared for retaliation.

709
00:48:42,965 --> 00:48:47,636
We took our game of war to the end.

710
00:48:47,761 --> 00:48:51,890
This was not a battlefield where...

711
00:48:52,015 --> 00:48:55,394
we think we would attack
and that will be the end.

712
00:48:57,229 --> 00:48:59,481
Put yourselves in our place.

713
00:48:59,606 --> 00:49:02,651
We hit the American base.

714
00:49:03,944 --> 00:49:06,864
He claimed to target 52 points.

715
00:49:06,989 --> 00:49:09,116
He reacts.

716
00:49:09,241 --> 00:49:13,287
What do you do?
What will he do in return?

717
00:49:14,121 --> 00:49:18,667
<i>We were the source of
the theory ourselves...</i>

718
00:49:19,626 --> 00:49:24,715
<i>that our missile might have been fired.</i>

719
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:28,886
<i>Only because it happened at the same time.</i>

720
00:49:30,262 --> 00:49:34,558
<i>And if we were not the source...</i>

721
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:40,606
<i>for shaping this theory...</i>

722
00:49:42,274 --> 00:49:46,486
<i>no one could find out.</i>

723
00:49:48,197 --> 00:49:51,742
<i>We did not touch anything.</i>

724
00:49:53,243 --> 00:49:58,165
<i>Neither removing the airplane pieces
nor disturbing the scene.</i>

725
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:02,836
<i>Nor moving the missile unit.</i>

726
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,964
<i>Neither the radar graphs.</i>

727
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:12,241
I think, now,
the only hope that we have,

728
00:50:12,242 --> 00:50:15,805
unfortunately,
is Ukraine’s criminal case.

729
00:50:15,806 --> 00:50:18,071
Because, for some reason,

730
00:50:18,072 --> 00:50:20,909
we haven’t decided
to join Ukraine

731
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:22,911
in the joint investigation.

732
00:50:22,912 --> 00:50:28,323
For some reason, we haven’t done
enough in ICAO.

733
00:50:28,324 --> 00:50:31,854
So, Michel, we don’t talk about
conspiracy theories.

734
00:50:31,855 --> 00:50:35,231
Opening the airspace open
that night is a crime.

735
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:38,630
Bulldozing the crash site
is a crime.

736
00:50:38,631 --> 00:50:42,062
Looting the belongings
of the passengers is a crime.

737
00:50:42,063 --> 00:50:44,834
All of that should have been
addressed in ICAO.

738
00:50:44,835 --> 00:50:47,639
But we failed to do that,
unfortunately.

739
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,938
And we talked to
Mr. Sciacchitano last week,

740
00:50:49,939 --> 00:50:53,040
and when I asked him why he
didn’t address these issues,

741
00:50:53,041 --> 00:50:55,449
he said Canada
hasn’t brought them up.

742
00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:58,287
So he blamed Canada
for not acting

743
00:50:58,288 --> 00:51:00,619
as a principal member of ICAO.

744
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:05,426
So then, in my opinion,
we have lost one year in ICAO.

745
00:51:05,427 --> 00:51:10,167
And we already lost one year
in the criminal investigation.

746
00:51:10,168 --> 00:51:12,400
So Ukraine probably is
the only hope

747
00:51:12,401 --> 00:51:13,467
for the families now,

748
00:51:13,468 --> 00:51:15,172
if we want to see
these criminals

749
00:51:15,173 --> 00:51:16,668
in an international
court of justice.

750
00:51:16,669 --> 00:51:21,310
We had a meeting with Ukrainian
officials last week as well.

751
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:23,345
And as a human rights
organization...

752
00:51:23,346 --> 00:51:26,414
Because this association
is a human rights organization.

753
00:51:26,415 --> 00:51:31,947
I just assured them that we are
not gonna sign any document

754
00:51:31,948 --> 00:51:35,555
accepting an apology
or accepting compensation

755
00:51:35,556 --> 00:51:36,886
from the Iranian Government.

756
00:51:36,887 --> 00:51:39,889
If this road is going to end up
to compensation

757
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:43,861
and an apology from Iran,
we are not in.

if they can take over

Because the AAIB is part of the

not just legislation, but also
structural independence.

The rule that the country
where it happened

820

doesn’t work.

But from day one, Mr. Goodale,

857
00:57:31,241 --> 00:57:34,078
we said that Iran
is not gonna cooperate.

858
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:37,015
When we see the lawyers
of the government here,

859
00:57:37,016 --> 00:57:41,316
they narrowed the reparations
to an apology and compensation.

860
00:57:41,317 --> 00:57:47,795
What about the truth? Truth is
a big part of the reparations.

861
00:57:47,796 --> 00:57:51,634
And we know that we won’t
get it from Iran.

862
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:53,427

And we have nowhere to go.

00:57:57,905 --> 00:58:02,712
We have to just have meetings,
write letters. And...

00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:24,491
This is my life.

873
00:58:24,492 --> 00:58:28,803
And I am not that kind
of person, who walks away.

874
00:58:28,804 --> 00:58:30,970
I will stand until
the end of this.

875
00:58:30,971 --> 00:58:35,745
And I will die for something
as valuable as justice.

(IN FARSI):

878
00:58:43,315 --> 00:58:46,735
They told you their
neutrality prohibits them...

879
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:50,489
from responding to your call for justice?

880
00:58:51,949 --> 00:58:53,450
Yes.

881
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:58,294
This is
the Communications Chief
of the ICAO,

882
00:58:58,295 --> 00:59:03,266
answering to my interview
request for the documentary.

883
00:59:03,267 --> 00:59:05,433
The neutrality of this
organization

884
00:59:05,434 --> 00:59:07,468
prohibits them
from participating

885
00:59:07,469 --> 00:59:09,371
to an interview
for a documentary

886
00:59:09,372 --> 00:59:12,308
about air traffic safety
and flight PS752.

887
00:59:12,309 --> 00:59:14,508
Is that what the world
has come to?

888
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,444
You want to talk to just...

889
00:59:16,445 --> 00:59:21,186
I asked directly for
President Sciacchitano.

890
00:59:25,619 --> 00:59:30,095
ICAO is the organization

891
00:59:30,096 --> 00:59:33,032
which is responsible for
the safety of the skies.

892
00:59:33,033 --> 00:59:37,597
So what happened here,
the International community

893
00:59:37,598 --> 00:59:40,237
and other governments,
they handed over

894
00:59:40,238 --> 00:59:42,437
the investigation
to the murderer.

895
00:59:42,438 --> 00:59:45,176
This is a nightmare
for the families.

896
00:59:45,177 --> 00:59:48,410
This will be
our nightmare forever.

897
00:59:48,411 --> 00:59:50,511
Thinking about those moments.

898
00:59:50,512 --> 00:59:52,612
I just want
to show you something.

899
00:59:52,613 --> 00:59:57,859
This is a (BEEP!)
of a victim.

900
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:01,698
At the time that ICAO was not
condemning this crime,

901
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:05,867
this was happening in Iran.
It happened last February.

902
01:00:05,868 --> 01:00:10,465
They lashed him.
And he lost his (BEEP!).

903
01:00:10,466 --> 01:00:13,743
And he was in prison. He’s not
allowed to leave the country.

904
01:00:13,744 --> 01:00:15,877
At the airport,
they downed the plane,

905
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:18,209
he’s not allowed to leave
the country.

906
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:21,982
This is the criminal
investigation they are doing.

of my wife, her OHIP card.

on the crash site in July,

by a total stranger,

910
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:36,833
and was sent to me on Instagram.

934
01:02:08,478 --> 01:02:12,232
I must see something.

01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:27,331
You are helping us only for money?

<i>I have money trouble. Yes.</i>

939
01:02:32,461 --> 01:02:35,130
<i>I also don't want my
identity to be revealed.</i>

940
01:02:35,255 --> 01:02:38,300
<i>You know what it's like in Iran.</i>

941
01:02:38,425 --> 01:02:45,933
Of course we need the original documents
to use them as evidence.

942
01:02:46,642 --> 01:02:50,270
<i>Of course. I will send you the originals.</i>

943

01:02:53,148 --> 01:02:56,944
Very well. I will wait.

<i>- I am at your service.</i>
- Thank you.

946
01:03:22,052 --> 01:03:25,055
Sounded like a military man.

947
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:28,016
Yes. Religious, military.

948
01:03:28,684 --> 01:03:31,520
$75,000 is not much money to ask.

949
01:03:33,397 --> 01:03:36,191
He is low-balling to lure you in.

950
01:03:36,316 --> 01:03:38,819
It's not because he wants it.

951
01:03:39,319 --> 01:03:43,532
I think he was low ranking,
nothing with authority.

952
01:03:43,657 --> 01:03:45,284
Yes.

953
01:03:53,623 --> 01:03:55,558
<i>(HAMED): I don’t
want to get into details.</i>

954
01:03:55,559 --> 01:03:57,934
I understand the lines
are not secure.

955
01:03:57,935 --> 01:04:02,862
I just want to tell you that
at least two people from

956
01:04:02,863 --> 01:04:05,601
(BEEP!) contacted us.

957
01:04:05,602 --> 01:04:09,572
But the RCMP didn’t show
any interest to check this.

958
01:04:09,573 --> 01:04:12,509
They have the audio files.
They have everything.

959
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:15,050
When somebody from Iran
contacts me,

960
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:16,876
and says, "I want to talk to you

961
01:04:16,877 --> 01:04:19,615
and I want to give you
this information,"

962
01:04:19,616 --> 01:04:20,616
what should I do?

963
01:04:20,617 --> 01:04:23,058
The best approach, I think,
is that somebody,

964
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:26,919
a liaison officer, or somebody,
or a team

965
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:30,659
just helping me,
or the other family members,

966
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:32,463
"Okay, this is
the way to do it."

967
01:04:32,464 --> 01:04:36,500
Or, "We need this document
to prove that."

968
01:04:36,501 --> 01:04:39,041
I am not an expert on this.

969
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:44,112
So that’s why it just puts
this duty on my shoulders

970
01:04:44,113 --> 01:04:46,477
to go and find
the guy in (BEEP!).

971
01:04:46,478 --> 01:04:50,943
Do you think that this letter
is valid, or not?

972

(IN FARSI):

973
01:04:51,642 --> 01:04:53,727
Will they follow up?

974
01:04:53,852 --> 01:04:56,855
- Will there be a criminal case?
- No.

975
01:04:56,980 --> 01:05:00,609
At the end I said we will go to Ukraine.

976
01:05:02,361 --> 01:05:05,280
- I said we will go to Ukraine.
- Okay.

977
01:05:05,405 --> 01:05:07,324

Nothing to worry
about. Kyiv is a safe city.

know about this trip.

There is nothing to worry about.

983
01:05:44,778 --> 01:05:48,282
But no one should know until we return.

984
01:06:13,515 --> 01:06:17,269
I liked this airport.

985
01:06:17,936 --> 01:06:20,022
Now I hate all airports.

986
01:06:21,106 --> 01:06:23,901
It took hold of me since
I entered the airport.

987
01:06:25,277 --> 01:06:28,238
I must go on this trip.

988
01:06:28,363 --> 01:06:31,241
I don't want to get on an airplane.

989
01:06:33,994 --> 01:06:35,787
I don't want to anymore.

to go since May 2020.

re-scheduled for December.

01:11:02,804 --> 01:11:09,728
to receive Reera and Parisa's belongings
if they delivered anything.

1044
01:11:09,853 --> 01:11:12,648
He sent me some photos later.

1045
01:11:12,773 --> 01:11:15,150
Keys, an iPhone and a watch.

1046
01:11:15,275 --> 01:11:18,111
He asked if I could identify any of them.

1047
01:11:18,237 --> 01:11:21,323
The phone had Parisa's name on it.

1048
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:25,369
I immediately recognized
Parisa's Apple Watch.

1049
01:11:28,372 --> 01:11:30,415

during those 3 minutes and 42 seconds.

1056
01:11:56,108 --> 01:12:00,571

recorded on her watch.

any way we can find out

1058
01:12:08,315 --> 01:12:10,151
through my Apple ID on the web,

1059
01:12:10,152 --> 01:12:14,386
when was the last time
my Apple Watch was backed up?

1060
01:12:13,876 --> 01:12:16,128
I know it was two days before.

1061

1062
01:12:16,253 --> 01:12:19,590
- On the sixth.
- It was more than two days.

01:12:19,715 --> 01:12:24,261

- Here is the sixth.

It came on for one moment.

1068
01:12:44,923 --> 01:12:46,253
This dilemma has started because

1069
01:12:46,254 --> 01:12:48,189
the original iPhone
is destroyed.

1070
01:12:48,190 --> 01:12:53,503

I asked where she wants
to be buried after death.

She said...

"Whatever Reera wants."

Where and how.

1118
01:16:53,405 --> 01:16:56,325
Reera wasn't there for me to ask her.

1119
01:16:57,910 --> 01:17:00,329
But I knew what her answer would be.

1120
01:17:01,914 --> 01:17:03,957
It would be in Canada.

1121
01:17:04,082 --> 01:17:12,082
And because Parisa loved lakes
and the sea...

1122
01:17:15,177 --> 01:17:18,138
I searched to find somewhere near water.

Near a river or a lake.

Now it is near a small lake.

1125

We chose that location.

1126
01:17:30,901 --> 01:17:36,532
The symbol on the site was
very important for me...

1127
01:17:36,657 --> 01:17:42,037
that it represents three people.

1128

Two of them left but the third...
is practically gone.

I wanted something beautiful
to be left behind on this earth.
