01:16.680 --> 01:19.040
"One day, when he was naughty,

01:19.080 --> 01:20.000
Mr Bunnsy looked over the hedge
into Farmer Fred's field

01:20.000 --> 01:23.080
Mr Bunnsy looked over the hedge
into Farmer Fred's field

01:23.120 --> 01:26.920
and it was full of green lettuces."

01:26.960 --> 01:28.000
"Mr Bunnsy, however,
was not full of lettuces."

01:28.000 --> 01:31.040
"Mr Bunnsy, however,
was not full of lettuces."

01:31.080 --> 01:33.720
"This did not seem fair."

01:33.760 --> 01:35.880
Not fair at all!

01:35.920 --> 01:36.000
So there you go.
Those are the opening words

01:36.000 --> 01:38.520
So there you go.
Those are the opening words

01:38.560 --> 01:41.480
to Mr Bunnsy Has An Adventure.

01:41.520 --> 01:44.000
But that is not the story
you will see.

01:44.000 --> 01:44.680
But that is not the story
you will see.

01:44.720 --> 01:48.920
This, what you're watching right
now, is called a framing device,

01:48.960 --> 01:51.760
a story that wraps around
the main story

01:51.800 --> 01:52.000
like a warm blanket around a baby.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.240
like a warm blanket around a baby.

01:55.280 --> 01:57.000
Steady there. Right!

01:57.040 --> 01:59.520
Now, we have to get
your story started.

01:59.560 --> 02:00.000
And it's not about cute rabbits
wearing clothes. Not at all!

02:00.000 --> 02:03.400
And it's not about cute rabbits
wearing clothes. Not at all!

02:03.440 --> 02:05.200
In fact,

02:05.240 --> 02:06.840
your story

02:06.880 --> 02:08.000
is all about...

02:08.000 --> 02:09.320
is all about...

02:09.360 --> 02:11.200
Rats!

02:11.240 --> 02:13.280
You've got...

02:13.320 --> 02:14.920
..r-r-rats!

02:14.960 --> 02:16.000
Rats!

02:16.000 --> 02:16.920
Rats!

02:16.960 --> 02:18.880
# Twitching noses, cunning faces

02:18.920 --> 02:20.600
# Hiding in the strangest places

02:20.640 --> 02:22.520
# Always gnawing, clawing, peeking

02:22.560 --> 02:24.000
# Climbing, jumping, squealing,
squeaking

02:24.000 --> 02:24.480
# Climbing, jumping, squealing,
squeaking

02:24.520 --> 02:26.640
Agh!

02:26.680 --> 02:27.920
Cluck! Cluck!

02:27.960 --> 02:29.720
# Greedy for your precious treat

02:29.760 --> 02:31.640
# They lick the crumbs
from off their feet

02:31.680 --> 02:32.000
# They undermine your soil and ground

02:32.000 --> 02:33.560
# They undermine your soil and ground

02:33.600 --> 02:35.360
# Try to catch them, can't be found!

02:35.400 --> 02:38.040
Hey, that cat can talk!

02:38.080 --> 02:40.000
Rats!

02:40.000 --> 02:40.560
Rats!

02:40.600 --> 02:43.400
You've... got... rats!

02:43.440 --> 02:46.280
Rats! Whaaat?!

02:46.320 --> 02:47.880
# Nibbling here, napping there

02:47.920 --> 02:48.000
# They widdle on your tableware

02:48.000 --> 02:49.840
# They widdle on your tableware

02:49.880 --> 02:52.000
# You try to poison,
trap and shoot them

02:52.040 --> 02:54.200
# Race and chase
and stomp and boot them

02:54.240 --> 02:56.000
# They leap with marvellous agility

02:56.000 --> 02:56.280
# They leap with marvellous agility

02:56.320 --> 02:59.240
# No beast can match their sheer...

02:59.280 --> 03:01.280
Er... Erm...

03:01.320 --> 03:03.640
..adaptability?

03:04.600 --> 03:08.320
# Rats! Rats!
# You've got multiplying rats!

03:08.360 --> 03:09.480
# You've...
# You've...

03:09.520 --> 03:11.360
# Got rats!
# Got rats!

03:11.400 --> 03:12.000
# Rats! #

03:12.000 --> 03:14.280
# Rats! #

03:17.320 --> 03:19.240
There really aren't all that many.

03:19.280 --> 03:20.000
You don't need many for a plague,
not if they know their business.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.400
You don't need many for a plague,
not if they know their business.

03:22.440 --> 03:25.760
One rat taking a bath in fresh cream
and widdling in the flour?

03:25.800 --> 03:28.000
Could be a plague all by himself!

03:28.000 --> 03:29.720
Could be a plague all by himself!

03:29.760 --> 03:31.800
A plague?
We're doomed!

03:31.840 --> 03:35.480
I suppose you want us to pay you
to get rid of them!Me?

03:35.520 --> 03:36.000
Just one lone cat? Against all that?

03:36.000 --> 03:38.280
Just one lone cat? Against all that?

03:40.320 --> 03:43.080
Well, I am good, it's true,
but no, no, no, no,

03:43.120 --> 03:44.000
one cat will never do.

03:44.000 --> 03:44.520
one cat will never do.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.560
Oh, what, then? What?

03:46.600 --> 03:48.600
You need...

03:48.640 --> 03:50.880
..the Piper.

04:00.760 --> 04:02.360
That's not the Pied Piper!

04:02.400 --> 04:06.080
Hm! Not the real one, anyway.

04:07.840 --> 04:08.000
Your saviour has arrived.
Come on, pony up!

04:08.000 --> 04:11.880
Your saviour has arrived.
Come on, pony up!

04:17.280 --> 04:20.640
Oh, it's working!

04:20.680 --> 04:22.920
Yes!

04:22.960 --> 04:24.000
They're leaving! They're leaving!

04:24.000 --> 04:24.800
They're leaving! They're leaving!

04:42.520 --> 04:45.800
Whoaaa!

04:45.840 --> 04:47.680
Ahhh...

04:50.960 --> 04:54.520
Yay! No more rats!

04:54.560 --> 04:56.000
No more rats! Whoo!

04:56.000 --> 04:57.080
No more rats! Whoo!

04:57.120 --> 05:01.040
Hey! Where did the talking cat go?

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
Whose brilliant idea was the cliff?

05:12.000 --> 05:12.320
Whose brilliant idea was the cliff?

05:12.360 --> 05:15.840
The swimming
and the water - pfft! - up my nose?

05:15.880 --> 05:17.760
Sorry! Sorry!

05:17.800 --> 05:20.000
That was me! Whoa!

05:20.000 --> 05:20.640
That was me! Whoa!

05:20.680 --> 05:25.000
The idea just kind of hit me
and I ran with it!

05:27.080 --> 05:28.000
Ah, that was fun!

05:28.000 --> 05:29.240
Ah, that was fun!

05:29.280 --> 05:33.480
Let's do it again!
Ooh! It did provide dramatic flair!

05:33.520 --> 05:36.000
A climactic end to the affair!

05:36.000 --> 05:36.760
A climactic end to the affair!

05:36.800 --> 05:40.120
Yo! Who thinks Keith here

05:40.160 --> 05:42.040
needs to go for a little swim
himself?

05:42.080 --> 05:44.000
All in favour?Aye!

05:44.000 --> 05:45.920
All in favour?Aye!

05:45.960 --> 05:48.240
Well, that went well!

05:48.280 --> 05:51.080
Says the cat who's perfectly dry.

05:51.120 --> 05:52.000
But look! Cash! Money!

05:52.000 --> 05:53.520
But look! Cash! Money!

05:53.560 --> 05:55.320
Ahem-hem!

05:55.360 --> 05:58.400
That sound always spells trouble.

05:58.440 --> 06:00.000
Ahem! Morris...

06:00.000 --> 06:00.800
Ahem! Morris...

06:00.840 --> 06:04.200
Peaches, Peaches... How many times?
It's "Maurice"!

06:04.240 --> 06:06.080
"Mauriiice."

06:06.120 --> 06:08.000
All right, fine, out with it.

06:08.000 --> 06:08.200
All right, fine, out with it.

06:08.240 --> 06:12.840
Well, Morris, Dangerous Beans thinks
we shouldn't live by trickery.

06:12.880 --> 06:15.520
Oh?
Is that what Dangerous Beans thinks?

06:15.560 --> 06:16.000
You know, some think

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
You know, some think

06:17.040 --> 06:21.040
there's a good deal too much thinking
going on, and I think I agree.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.880
Peaches is right.

06:25.560 --> 06:28.880
With our newfound intelligence
comes a conscience.

06:28.920 --> 06:32.000
We must ask,
"Is it right to trick people?"

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
We must ask,
"Is it right to trick people?"

06:33.040 --> 06:37.080
But trickery is what humans
are all about!

06:37.120 --> 06:38.880
They're so keen on tricking
each other,

06:38.920 --> 06:40.000
they elect governments
to do it for them!

06:40.000 --> 06:41.280
they elect governments
to do it for them!

06:41.320 --> 06:46.120
But does it feel right?
Ahem! What Dangerous Beans means is,

06:46.160 --> 06:48.000
"Do we really need
to keep doing THIS?"

06:48.000 --> 06:49.040
"Do we really need
to keep doing THIS?"

06:49.080 --> 06:51.880
"Doing this"? Well, of course, no!

06:51.920 --> 06:55.480
In fact, I don't have to be here
at all! I'm a cat, right?

06:55.520 --> 06:56.000
There's no end of things I could
be doing, because people like cats.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.520
There's no end of things I could
be doing, because people like cats.

06:59.560 --> 07:04.000
Instead, I choose to help
a bunch of ungrateful rodents

07:04.000 --> 07:04.680
Instead, I choose to help
a bunch of ungrateful rodents

07:04.720 --> 07:08.840
who are not exactly number one
favourites with humans. Right?

07:08.880 --> 07:10.600
But if I may remind you,

07:10.640 --> 07:12.000
you were the ones who wanted to find
the island paradise.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.880
you were the ones who wanted to find
the island paradise.

07:15.920 --> 07:18.880
Paradise...

07:18.920 --> 07:20.000
Bring forth the sacred book.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.960
Bring forth the sacred book.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.520
Hey, hey, Keith!
Hm?

07:24.560 --> 07:27.800
The sacred book!
Oh, yes, yes! Er... Ahem!

07:27.840 --> 07:28.000
There you go.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.480
There you go.

07:34.480 --> 07:36.000
Ah, this is where we're headed!

07:36.000 --> 07:37.200
Ah, this is where we're headed!

07:37.240 --> 07:38.840
An ideal land,

07:38.880 --> 07:40.840
where animals talk

07:40.880 --> 07:44.000
and live side-by-side with people
in peace!

07:44.000 --> 07:44.880
and live side-by-side with people
in peace!

07:44.920 --> 07:48.240
Oh, look! Animals wearing clothes.

07:48.280 --> 07:52.000
A rabbit who walks on his hind legs
and wears a blue suit.

07:52.040 --> 07:53.720
And there's a rat called Rupert

07:53.760 --> 07:56.200
and a stoat
who goes by the name of Howard.

07:56.240 --> 07:58.480
And Olly the Snake
is a bit of a rascal,

07:58.520 --> 08:00.000
but don't worry, nothing truly bad
ever happens there!

08:00.000 --> 08:01.640
but don't worry, nothing truly bad
ever happens there!

08:01.680 --> 08:04.040
It is paradise!

08:04.080 --> 08:06.320
In the land of Mr Bunnsy,

08:06.360 --> 08:08.000
there are no poisons,
there are no traps!

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
there are no poisons,
there are no traps!

08:11.040 --> 08:13.760
None of the animals
eats any of the others.

08:13.800 --> 08:16.000
It IS paradise.

08:16.000 --> 08:16.040
It IS paradise.

08:16.080 --> 08:19.960
We must find this place.
Exactly!

08:20.000 --> 08:22.040
You've been there, right, Morris?

08:22.080 --> 08:24.000
Me? The Amazing Maurice?

08:24.000 --> 08:25.400
Me? The Amazing Maurice?

08:25.440 --> 08:29.160
Er, no, not personally, no. But I've
spoken to many cats who have.

08:29.200 --> 08:32.000
As we all know, it's an island.
A beautiful faraway island.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.680
As we all know, it's an island.
A beautiful faraway island.

08:34.720 --> 08:38.520
And to get to the island,
we need what? Boats. Right?

08:38.560 --> 08:40.000
And to get boats, we need what?
Money. Right?

08:40.000 --> 08:41.560
And to get boats, we need what?
Money. Right?

08:41.600 --> 08:44.520
We have to keep making money.
Understand?

08:46.080 --> 08:48.000
Fine. That's settled, then.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.800
Fine. That's settled, then.

08:49.840 --> 08:53.280
Keith, let's go.Oh!Our next target
is this way.OK, coming!

08:53.320 --> 08:54.560
Oof!

08:59.920 --> 09:03.440
Perhaps... one more town.

09:03.480 --> 09:04.000
Yay!

09:04.000 --> 09:05.560
Yay!

09:13.720 --> 09:18.200
Now, in fact, Morris was lying.

09:18.240 --> 09:20.000
That's the beauty
of the framing device, see?

09:20.000 --> 09:21.080
That's the beauty
of the framing device, see?

09:21.120 --> 09:24.440
I get to tell you stuff about this
story you wouldn't otherwise know.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.840
Like, I can tell you that Morris
never spoke to other cats

09:27.880 --> 09:28.000
because no other cat
could speak back.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.320
because no other cat
could speak back.

09:31.360 --> 09:33.800
Morris was as unique as the rats!

09:33.840 --> 09:36.000
He knew money was important, so he
lied to the rats to make more of it.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
He knew money was important, so he
lied to the rats to make more of it.

09:37.040 --> 09:39.800
In truth,
he was building himself a nest egg

09:39.840 --> 09:44.000
so he could make good
on his deluxe retirement plan.

09:44.000 --> 09:44.200
so he could make good
on his deluxe retirement plan.

09:44.240 --> 09:47.880
And now you know Mr Bunnsy
is important to the story

09:47.920 --> 09:50.720
because the rats believe he is real.

09:50.760 --> 09:52.000
They think they can find a land
where all the animals talk

09:52.000 --> 09:54.720
They think they can find a land
where all the animals talk

09:54.760 --> 09:57.720
and live happily ever after.

09:57.760 --> 10:00.000
"Farmer Fred opened his door

10:00.000 --> 10:00.600
"Farmer Fred opened his door

10:00.640 --> 10:05.480
and saw all the animals
of Furry Bottom waiting for him."

10:05.520 --> 10:08.000
"We can't find Mr Bunnsy!"
..they cried.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.360
"We can't find Mr Bunnsy!"
..they cried.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.320
If that sounds ominous

10:11.360 --> 10:15.240
it's because it's called
foreshadowing.

10:15.280 --> 10:16.000
Which is kind of a promise to you,

10:16.000 --> 10:17.320
Which is kind of a promise to you,

10:17.360 --> 10:19.920
letting you know
that if you keep with the story,

10:19.960 --> 10:22.840
it's going to get...

10:22.880 --> 10:24.000
..ugly. Really ugly!

10:24.000 --> 10:27.160
..ugly. Really ugly!

10:27.200 --> 10:29.960
You, my dear fellows,
are the best rat catchers around

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
and you've done a great job,
of course you have.

10:32.000 --> 10:32.360
and you've done a great job,
of course you have.

10:32.400 --> 10:35.040
There are no rats
anywhere in the town!

10:35.080 --> 10:37.400
Thank you, Mr Mayor!

10:37.440 --> 10:39.560
That we can see.

10:39.600 --> 10:40.000
Er, what's that?
It's just that,

10:40.000 --> 10:42.080
Er, what's that?
It's just that,

10:42.120 --> 10:45.120
well, the food in the town
continues to...

10:45.160 --> 10:46.320
..disappear!

10:46.360 --> 10:48.000
It's just...

10:48.000 --> 10:48.720
It's just...

10:48.760 --> 10:52.040
..gone.Huh?
Poof!Uh?!

10:57.360 --> 11:01.280
We are in the midst of a famine!

11:01.320 --> 11:04.000
What are you trying to say?
Or, in fact, saying?

11:04.000 --> 11:05.520
What are you trying to say?
Or, in fact, saying?

11:05.560 --> 11:08.840
What I am trying to say,
or at least imply, strongly,

11:08.880 --> 11:11.920
is that there must be a connection!

11:13.560 --> 11:15.120
Connection?

11:15.160 --> 11:17.240
The rats? The food?

11:17.280 --> 11:20.000
It's rather strange, isn't it?

11:20.000 --> 11:21.600
It's rather strange, isn't it?

11:21.640 --> 11:25.880
Talking of strange, that, er,
new fellow in town, your employer,

11:25.920 --> 11:28.000
what's his name, It's, er...?
Boss Man.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.080
what's his name, It's, er...?
Boss Man.

11:29.120 --> 11:32.000
Yes, yes, yes.
Well, with all those clothes

11:32.040 --> 11:34.680
and that scarf and the hat,
I-I can't really see him,

11:34.720 --> 11:36.000
you know, your boss, I mean.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.360
you know, your boss, I mean.

11:37.400 --> 11:40.560
Strange, you say?

11:40.600 --> 11:42.000
Er, not that strange!

11:42.040 --> 11:44.000
Have you considered

11:44.000 --> 11:44.640
Have you considered

11:44.680 --> 11:48.040
that what you have here,

11:48.080 --> 11:50.720
with the missing food,

11:50.760 --> 11:52.000
is a mystery?
Mystery! Oh, yes! That's correct!

11:52.000 --> 11:54.560
is a mystery?
Mystery! Oh, yes! That's correct!

11:54.600 --> 11:58.320
And with the rats gone,
none to be found,

11:58.360 --> 12:00.000
that factor is simply...

12:00.000 --> 12:01.400
that factor is simply...

12:01.440 --> 12:03.480
..unrelated.

12:03.520 --> 12:06.080
Unrelated!

12:07.120 --> 12:08.000
Mm-hm.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.480
Mm-hm.

12:11.520 --> 12:14.080
Always nice to do business with you,

12:14.120 --> 12:16.000
Mr Mayor!

12:16.000 --> 12:16.520
Mr Mayor!

12:19.240 --> 12:21.640
Mum?
What is it, love?

12:21.680 --> 12:23.880
I'm hungry!

12:23.920 --> 12:24.000
How about we pick leaves from the
ground and make leaf sandwiches?

12:24.000 --> 12:27.280
How about we pick leaves from the
ground and make leaf sandwiches?

12:27.320 --> 12:31.120
With no bread. Just leaves.
And imaginary jam.

12:38.840 --> 12:40.000
Stay low. Quiet as mice.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.400
Stay low. Quiet as mice.

12:50.560 --> 12:52.680
Remember, this is a new town.

12:52.720 --> 12:56.000
There's bound to be new traps
and poisons.

12:56.000 --> 12:56.120
There's bound to be new traps
and poisons.

12:58.760 --> 13:01.040
Allow me.

13:01.080 --> 13:04.000
Why do we wear clothes?
It makes no... sense!

13:04.000 --> 13:06.240
Why do we wear clothes?
It makes no... sense!

13:06.280 --> 13:09.880
Unless we're on stage!

13:09.920 --> 13:12.000
Dangerous Beans says it's civilised.

13:12.000 --> 13:12.760
Dangerous Beans says it's civilised.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.680
And the concept of the belt
is worthy.

13:14.720 --> 13:17.680
You never know
what you're going to need next.

13:17.720 --> 13:19.880
Move on!

13:23.720 --> 13:26.960
All right, let's stop here!

13:28.360 --> 13:32.840
Number Three Platoon - In-Brine,
Sell-By, Sardines and Delicious,

13:32.880 --> 13:34.360
you're on widdling duty.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.000
Go to it!
If I don't hear ladies screaming

13:36.000 --> 13:36.840
Go to it!
If I don't hear ladies screaming

13:36.880 --> 13:40.000
and running out of their kitchens
within ten minutes,

13:40.040 --> 13:42.160
then you're not the rats
I think you are.

13:42.200 --> 13:44.000
Number Two Platoon -
Big Savings, Best Before,

13:44.000 --> 13:45.040
Number Two Platoon -
Big Savings, Best Before,

13:45.080 --> 13:47.000
Special Offer and Do Not Enter,

13:47.040 --> 13:48.680
you're on trap disposal.

13:48.720 --> 13:52.000
Use caution. Never rush, never run.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.640
We don't want to be like
the first mouse, eh?No!

13:54.680 --> 13:58.320
Right! What mouse do we want to
be like?The second mouse!

13:58.360 --> 14:00.000
Because?Because
the second mouse gets the cheese!

14:00.000 --> 14:03.080
Because?Because
the second mouse gets the cheese!

14:03.120 --> 14:04.440
You have a question?

14:04.480 --> 14:08.000
Er, what does the first mouse get?

14:08.000 --> 14:08.760
Er, what does the first mouse get?

14:25.360 --> 14:27.760
The trap. See?

14:27.800 --> 14:31.800
And then the Bone Rat comes for ya!

14:31.840 --> 14:32.000
The Bone... ..Rat?

14:32.000 --> 14:35.160
The Bone... ..Rat?

14:35.200 --> 14:38.160
Mm-mm.

14:38.200 --> 14:39.920
All right! Go! Go! Go!

14:39.960 --> 14:40.000
Keith and Maurice
will be in position soon.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.080
Keith and Maurice
will be in position soon.

14:42.120 --> 14:45.640
You know what
worries me, Dangerous Beans?

14:45.680 --> 14:48.000
What is it that worries you,
Darktan?

14:48.000 --> 14:48.520
What is it that worries you,
Darktan?

14:48.560 --> 14:51.760
There aren't any local rats here.
Normal rats, you know?

14:51.800 --> 14:54.920
Rat tunnels? Yeah.
Rat droppings? In abundance!

14:54.960 --> 14:56.000
But we've seen no actual rats.

14:56.000 --> 14:56.680
But we've seen no actual rats.

14:56.720 --> 14:58.680
A town like this
should be full of 'em.

14:58.720 --> 15:00.440
Hm. It smells, doesn't it?

15:00.480 --> 15:03.400
Yeah. It smells.

15:03.440 --> 15:04.000
It smells like a...

15:04.000 --> 15:06.560
It smells like a...

15:08.760 --> 15:11.400
A mystery.

15:19.080 --> 15:20.000
Hm. It's still all quiet.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.520
Hm. It's still all quiet.

15:22.560 --> 15:26.760
Sounds like the lads
didn't start their plague show yet.

15:31.080 --> 15:34.560
50 cents for every dead rat?

15:36.120 --> 15:38.240
They seem serious.

15:38.280 --> 15:42.360
50 cents! Huh! Must be a rich town.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.000
That's good. That's very good.
It means more money for me. Oh!

15:44.000 --> 15:45.640
That's good. That's very good.
It means more money for me. Oh!

15:45.680 --> 15:50.120
For us! For us, of course!

15:53.240 --> 15:57.440
Yeah, looks like a town
with opportunities.

15:58.960 --> 16:00.000
But have you noticed...

16:00.000 --> 16:00.880
But have you noticed...

16:00.920 --> 16:02.560
..there's no food?!

16:02.600 --> 16:07.600
That is odd! For a market town.
Yeah. Especially when you're hungry.

16:07.640 --> 16:08.000
Which is my way of saying,
"I'm really hungry!"

16:08.000 --> 16:10.680
Which is my way of saying,
"I'm really hungry!"

16:10.720 --> 16:13.640
Oh, look, this one's open! Ahem!

16:13.680 --> 16:15.440
Good day to you, sir!

16:15.480 --> 16:16.000
We're looking for... food?

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
We're looking for... food?

16:18.040 --> 16:20.880
Yes, well, there you go.
Right under your nose.

16:20.920 --> 16:24.000
Oh. Well, I guess, erm,
how much for the...

16:24.000 --> 16:24.320
Oh. Well, I guess, erm,
how much for the...

16:24.360 --> 16:26.720
Too late.Huh?
It's gone.

16:26.760 --> 16:29.600
No, but we're very...
And now we're closed. Sorry!

16:29.640 --> 16:31.200
Have a nice day!

16:31.240 --> 16:32.000
Maurice, what... What do you think?
Maurice?

16:32.000 --> 16:34.280
Maurice, what... What do you think?
Maurice?

16:35.320 --> 16:37.800
Maurice!

16:40.760 --> 16:42.240
Maurice?

16:44.000 --> 16:45.320
Maurice?

16:45.360 --> 16:47.120
Agh! Oof!

16:47.160 --> 16:48.000
It has everything you would
traditionally want in a kitchen,

16:48.000 --> 16:50.320
It has everything you would
traditionally want in a kitchen,

16:50.360 --> 16:52.600
except for something to eat.

16:52.640 --> 16:55.240
Maurice, please, let's go,
before someone...

16:55.280 --> 16:56.000
Quick, scratch me on the head!
There's a girl looking at us.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.960
Quick, scratch me on the head!
There's a girl looking at us.

17:02.160 --> 17:03.400
What?

17:03.440 --> 17:04.000
Who's to say a narrator can't also
appear in the story she's telling?

17:04.000 --> 17:07.320
Who's to say a narrator can't also
appear in the story she's telling?

17:07.360 --> 17:09.600
Did that cat just say something?

17:09.640 --> 17:12.000
Huh? Cats can't talk!
Everybody knows that.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.280
Huh? Cats can't talk!
Everybody knows that.

17:13.320 --> 17:15.520
Ah, I get it.
You brought the cat here

17:15.560 --> 17:18.120
because you know there's a famine
and you're going to sell it.

17:18.160 --> 17:20.000
There's at least two good meals
on those bones.

17:20.000 --> 17:20.280
There's at least two good meals
on those bones.

17:20.320 --> 17:22.640
What? You eat cats here?

17:22.680 --> 17:24.000
Ha! Got you!

17:24.040 --> 17:26.640
Yep, she got ya.
Mm.

17:26.680 --> 17:28.000
Well, there's some milk
that's not gone hard yet,

17:28.000 --> 17:28.680
Well, there's some milk
that's not gone hard yet,

17:28.720 --> 17:31.240
and a couple of fish heads.
That will have to do.

17:31.280 --> 17:33.600
Do? That will be ideal!

17:33.640 --> 17:36.000
But maybe we shouldn't eat your food
if there is so little?

17:36.000 --> 17:36.120
But maybe we shouldn't eat your food
if there is so little?

17:36.160 --> 17:39.400
No, no, no. My father, who happens
to be the mayor, by the way,

17:39.440 --> 17:41.160
says we need to be hospitable.

17:41.200 --> 17:42.720
So tell me your name.

17:42.760 --> 17:44.000
Er, Keith.

17:44.000 --> 17:44.080
Er, Keith.

17:44.120 --> 17:47.560
Oh, that won't do!
No hint of mystery.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.680
It just hints of... Keith!

17:49.720 --> 17:52.000
Are you sure that's your real name?
I don't know. I'm an orphan.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.560
Are you sure that's your real name?
I don't know. I'm an orphan.

17:53.600 --> 17:56.480
Ah, yeah! Mm! That's more like it.
A mysterious past.

17:56.520 --> 17:58.480
You were stolen at birth, I expect.

17:58.520 --> 18:00.000
You're probably the rightful king
of some distant country

18:00.000 --> 18:01.920
You're probably the rightful king
of some distant country

18:01.960 --> 18:04.280
and they found someone
who looked like you and did a swap!

18:04.320 --> 18:07.520
In that case,
you'll have a magic sword,

18:07.560 --> 18:08.000
only it won't look magic, you see,
until it's time for you

18:08.000 --> 18:10.320
only it won't look magic, you see,
until it's time for you

18:10.360 --> 18:12.880
to manifest your destiny!

18:12.920 --> 18:16.000
You were probably found on a
doorstep.Er, actually a hay cart.

18:16.000 --> 18:16.640
You were probably found on a
doorstep.Er, actually a hay cart.

18:16.680 --> 18:21.080
Just as good! Hey, it's customary
when somebody asks your name

18:21.120 --> 18:24.000
to reciprocate and ask them theirs.

18:24.000 --> 18:24.720
to reciprocate and ask them theirs.

18:26.080 --> 18:28.240
I'm Malicia Grim, by the way.

18:28.280 --> 18:29.920
Er... Hello,

18:29.960 --> 18:31.680
erm, Malicia.

18:31.720 --> 18:32.000
Nice, erm, to...
No! Sardines! Back!

18:32.000 --> 18:35.680
Nice, erm, to...
No! Sardines! Back!

18:35.720 --> 18:37.520
Rat!

18:41.880 --> 18:44.800
Sardines, no!
Easy on the tap dancing!

18:44.840 --> 18:46.440
Sorry! I've just got these...

18:46.480 --> 18:48.000
..d-dancing feet!

18:48.000 --> 18:48.440
..d-dancing feet!

18:48.480 --> 18:50.080
Whoa!
Ugh!

18:51.520 --> 18:56.000
All right.
I think it goes like this...

18:56.000 --> 18:57.240
All right.
I think it goes like this...

18:57.280 --> 19:01.880
This rat is clearly a magical rat.
I bet he's not the only one.

19:01.920 --> 19:04.000
Born that way, or something happened
to him, or them,

19:04.000 --> 19:04.600
Born that way, or something happened
to him, or them,

19:04.640 --> 19:07.960
and now they're quite intelligent,
despite the tap dancing.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
And the cat is friends with you...
Why would rats and a cat be friends?

19:12.000 --> 19:12.120
And the cat is friends with you...
Why would rats and a cat be friends?

19:12.160 --> 19:16.120
There must be some kind of
an arrangement. No, don't tell me!

19:16.160 --> 19:19.000
I shouldn't think anyone
ever has to tell you anything.

19:19.040 --> 19:20.000
Something to do with
plagues of rats, right?

19:20.000 --> 19:20.880
Something to do with
plagues of rats, right?

19:20.920 --> 19:24.320
All those towns we've heard about?
You got together with Keith here

19:24.360 --> 19:27.440
and you go from town to town
pretending to BE a plague of rats,

19:27.480 --> 19:28.000
Keith pretends to be a pied piper
and they all follow him out

19:28.000 --> 19:31.360
Keith pretends to be a pied piper
and they all follow him out

19:31.400 --> 19:34.600
and you make loads of cash, right?

19:34.640 --> 19:36.000
It's all a big swindle.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.160
It's all a big swindle.

19:38.560 --> 19:41.720
She's got us bang to rights, boss.

19:41.760 --> 19:43.760
You won't tell on us, will you?
Ha!

19:43.800 --> 19:44.000
A talking cat
and a talking, tap-dancing rat?

19:44.000 --> 19:46.840
A talking cat
and a talking, tap-dancing rat?

19:46.880 --> 19:48.960
They'll think I'm making up stories
again

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
and I'll be locked out of my room
as punishment.Locked out?

19:52.000 --> 19:52.720
and I'll be locked out of my room
as punishment.Locked out?

19:52.760 --> 19:56.960
So I can't get to my books. It might
not be obvious, but I read a lot.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.120
My father says "Too much!"

19:59.160 --> 20:00.000
Ah!

20:00.000 --> 20:00.360
Ah!

20:00.400 --> 20:03.840
So, here's the question -
how did you learn to talk?

20:03.880 --> 20:06.120
In a real story,
this is where we'd get a flashback.

20:06.160 --> 20:08.000
Flashback?What's that?
It's where you get the backstory.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.280
Flashback?What's that?
It's where you get the backstory.

20:09.320 --> 20:12.440
Go ahead, tell me what happened.

20:13.760 --> 20:16.000
There doesn't seem to be a way
to tell her no.

20:16.000 --> 20:16.720
There doesn't seem to be a way
to tell her no.

20:16.760 --> 20:19.720
What happened? Er...

20:19.760 --> 20:21.920
No-one knows for sure, you know,
but, erm...

20:21.960 --> 20:24.000
Rats eat rubbish. That's what we do!

20:24.000 --> 20:26.240
Rats eat rubbish. That's what we do!

20:26.280 --> 20:29.280
That was back when we were just
normal, everyday rats,

20:29.320 --> 20:30.920
squeaking and squabbling.

20:30.960 --> 20:32.000
We ate whatever we could find.
The stubs of candles, for example!

20:32.000 --> 20:34.200
We ate whatever we could find.
The stubs of candles, for example!

20:34.240 --> 20:36.040
We love candle stubs!

20:36.080 --> 20:38.000
And a weather-beaten broomstick.

20:38.040 --> 20:40.000
That can be good to get your teeth
into. And powders and potions.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.920
That can be good to get your teeth
into. And powders and potions.

20:41.960 --> 20:45.320
We drank green bubbly stuff
from the bottoms of cauldrons

20:45.360 --> 20:47.880
and gnawed our way
through worn-out spell books.

20:47.920 --> 20:48.000
Ha! Doesn't sound like an ordinary
rubbish heap!

20:48.000 --> 20:50.480
Ha! Doesn't sound like an ordinary
rubbish heap!

20:50.520 --> 20:52.120
We eventually figured that out.

20:52.160 --> 20:56.000
The dump belonged to
Unseen University of Ankh-Morpork...

20:56.000 --> 20:56.160
The dump belonged to
Unseen University of Ankh-Morpork...

20:57.160 --> 21:00.840
..the establishment of learning,
where magic is studied.

21:00.880 --> 21:04.000
All the mixed-up magic leftovers
from the men in pointy hats!

21:04.000 --> 21:04.480
All the mixed-up magic leftovers
from the men in pointy hats!

21:04.520 --> 21:05.560
I like it.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.520
Once we got smart,
we learned to read

21:07.560 --> 21:10.000
and gave ourselves names from
the things we found in the dump.

21:10.040 --> 21:11.760
"Sardines."

21:11.800 --> 21:12.000
"Peaches."

21:12.000 --> 21:13.640
"Peaches."

21:13.680 --> 21:15.760
"In-Brine!"

21:15.800 --> 21:18.600
What of the cat?
Cats don't eat any old rubbish.

21:18.640 --> 21:20.000
Decidedly not!
He never ate anything off the dump,

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Decidedly not!
He never ate anything off the dump,

21:21.040 --> 21:24.080
but he did get intelligent
around the same time.

21:24.120 --> 21:27.040
As an intelligent cat, I do vow,
and it is a point of pride,

21:27.080 --> 21:28.000
to not eat anything that can speak.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.400
to not eat anything that can speak.

21:29.440 --> 21:33.080
I know just what we must do next
to solve the mystery of our town!

21:33.120 --> 21:36.000
Huh? What mystery?
The missing food! The rats are gone!

21:36.000 --> 21:36.840
Huh? What mystery?
The missing food! The rats are gone!

21:36.880 --> 21:39.920
Why else would you be in this story,
if not to solve the mystery?

21:39.960 --> 21:42.720
We need to sneak into
the Rat-Catcher's Guild

21:42.760 --> 21:44.000
and find out what they're up to.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.280
and find out what they're up to.

21:45.320 --> 21:48.560
Ah. I am oddly compelled to follow.

21:48.600 --> 21:52.000
It's a gift.
I'm off to get my adventure bag.

21:52.000 --> 21:52.040
It's a gift.
I'm off to get my adventure bag.

21:53.440 --> 21:56.120
Yah! Ready?

21:57.120 --> 21:59.160
Let's go!

22:02.240 --> 22:04.320
I think I love her.

22:13.920 --> 22:16.000
Er, sir?

22:16.040 --> 22:19.040
You, er, you wanted to see us,

22:19.080 --> 22:21.400
sir.

22:21.440 --> 22:24.000
There are new rats in town.

22:24.000 --> 22:24.880
There are new rats in town.

22:24.920 --> 22:29.320
Are you sure, sir?

22:29.360 --> 22:32.000
The traps are empty. We...
I can feel it!

22:32.000 --> 22:34.040
The traps are empty. We...
I can feel it!

22:37.040 --> 22:40.000
Catch them and bring them to me.

22:40.000 --> 22:40.160
Catch them and bring them to me.

22:40.200 --> 22:42.880
Yes, sir! Right off, sir!

22:42.920 --> 22:45.120
You know I have a thing...

22:45.160 --> 22:47.560
..for rats.

22:56.560 --> 22:59.360
Important safety tip.

22:59.400 --> 23:01.920
Don't eat a dead rat
that just ate something,

23:01.960 --> 23:04.000
that just ate something,
that made it dead.

23:04.000 --> 23:04.600
that just ate something,
that made it dead.

23:04.640 --> 23:07.880
Dangerous Beans says
we shouldn't eat rats at all.

23:07.920 --> 23:11.880
True. Very true.
Unless you're hungry.

23:11.920 --> 23:12.000
But rats are always hungry.
My point exactly.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.440
But rats are always hungry.
My point exactly.

23:15.480 --> 23:18.280
Strange.

23:18.320 --> 23:20.000
Reminds me of, erm,

23:20.000 --> 23:20.760
Reminds me of, erm,

23:20.800 --> 23:23.320
a Prattle and Johnson
Little Snapper,

23:23.360 --> 23:25.680
but those are not round
like this one.

23:25.720 --> 23:28.000
Mm...

23:28.000 --> 23:28.040
Mm...

23:28.080 --> 23:33.400
Ah...
And there's no extra safety catch.

23:33.440 --> 23:36.000
I think we need... Mr Clicky.

23:36.000 --> 23:36.720
I think we need... Mr Clicky.

23:36.760 --> 23:40.240
Mr Clicky!
Come on, Mr Clicky.

23:43.040 --> 23:44.000
Mr Clicky!

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Mr Clicky!

23:45.040 --> 23:46.280
Oy, good luck, buddy!

23:46.320 --> 23:48.280
It's showtime, Mr Clicky!

23:48.320 --> 23:51.080
Go, Mr Clicky, you can do it!

23:51.120 --> 23:52.000
On the double, soldier.

23:52.000 --> 23:52.960
On the double, soldier.

23:54.920 --> 23:56.760
What are you waiting for?

23:56.800 --> 23:59.320
Time to do your duty.

23:59.360 --> 24:00.000
Mr Clicky?
Hey!

24:00.000 --> 24:02.080
Mr Clicky?
Hey!

24:02.120 --> 24:05.240
Where do you think you're going?!
Come on, lad!

24:05.280 --> 24:07.320
You're made of metal. This...

24:07.360 --> 24:08.000
can't... hurt.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.040
can't... hurt.

24:09.080 --> 24:10.440
Ugh!

24:11.760 --> 24:13.600
Darktan?!

24:17.440 --> 24:19.920
Wh... What?

24:23.680 --> 24:24.000
What is this?

24:24.000 --> 24:25.040
What is this?

24:25.080 --> 24:27.440
Ingenious. Never seen this before.

24:27.480 --> 24:31.280
It's a cage.
A cage.

24:31.320 --> 24:32.000
A cage!

24:32.000 --> 24:33.920
A cage!

24:33.960 --> 24:36.000
What's a cage?

24:36.040 --> 24:38.320
It's used to capture a rat.

24:38.360 --> 24:40.000
Who would want to keep a rat?

24:40.000 --> 24:41.760
Who would want to keep a rat?

24:53.440 --> 24:56.000
"And because of Olly the Snake's
trick with the road sign,

24:56.000 --> 24:59.320
"And because of Olly the Snake's
trick with the road sign,

24:59.360 --> 25:04.000
Mr Bunnsy did not know
that he had lost his way."

25:04.000 --> 25:04.240
Mr Bunnsy did not know
that he had lost his way."

25:04.280 --> 25:07.360
"He wasn't going
to Howard the Stoat's tea party."

25:08.360 --> 25:12.000
"He was heading into the Dark Wood."

25:12.000 --> 25:12.760
"He was heading into the Dark Wood."

25:25.760 --> 25:28.000
She seems to think that it's no good
looking inconspicuous

25:28.000 --> 25:29.480
She seems to think that it's no good
looking inconspicuous

25:29.520 --> 25:34.160
unless people can tell
that you are being inconspicuous.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.000
The trouble is, your lady friend
thinks life works like a fairy tale.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.120
The trouble is, your lady friend
thinks life works like a fairy tale.

25:39.160 --> 25:41.840
Mm. That's harmless, though,
isn't it?

25:41.880 --> 25:44.000
Maybe. But in fairy tales,

25:44.000 --> 25:44.320
Maybe. But in fairy tales,

25:44.360 --> 25:46.680
when someone gets hurt...

25:47.680 --> 25:49.880
..it's just a word.

25:51.360 --> 25:52.000
Hm?

25:52.000 --> 25:53.440
Hm?

25:57.880 --> 26:00.000
Luckily,
I'm prepared for every eventuality.

26:00.000 --> 26:00.920
Luckily,
I'm prepared for every eventuality.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.520
The grapnel and the rope ladder
take up a lot of room.

26:03.560 --> 26:06.720
And then there's the medicine kit
and the kettle, the back-up kettle,

26:06.760 --> 26:08.000
the sewing kit...
..and the mirror for sending signals

26:08.000 --> 26:09.720
the sewing kit...
..and the mirror for sending signals

26:09.760 --> 26:11.840
and these!

26:11.880 --> 26:15.760
Hair pins?You just push it
into the keyhole and twiddle.

26:15.800 --> 26:16.000
Malicia, those things work
in stories, not...That's right!

26:16.000 --> 26:19.280
Malicia, those things work
in stories, not...That's right!

26:19.320 --> 26:23.320
Oh, dear me.So,
we're back in your story, are we?

26:23.360 --> 26:24.000
And what am I in your story?

26:24.000 --> 26:24.880
And what am I in your story?

26:24.920 --> 26:29.000
Mm, not sure. You're not handsome
enough for a love interest

26:29.040 --> 26:31.480
and you're not funny enough
for comic relief.

26:31.520 --> 26:32.000
Maybe you're just
the sympathetic friend

26:32.000 --> 26:34.040
Maybe you're just
the sympathetic friend

26:34.080 --> 26:38.040
who serves as a sounding board to
help me resolve my ethical dilemmas.

26:38.080 --> 26:40.000
H-How is it you know
how to pick locks?

26:40.000 --> 26:40.880
H-How is it you know
how to pick locks?

26:40.920 --> 26:44.040
I told you, they lock me
out of my room to punish me.

26:44.080 --> 26:47.560
I've seen thieves at work,
"cat burglars" they call them

26:47.600 --> 26:48.000
because they are nearly as clever
as cats.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.920
because they are nearly as clever
as cats.

26:49.960 --> 26:52.120
They have complicated little tools

26:52.160 --> 26:54.480
which are used with great care
and precision.

26:54.520 --> 26:56.000
They don't ever just...

26:56.000 --> 26:56.360
They don't ever just...

26:57.680 --> 26:58.920
There we are!

26:58.960 --> 27:00.680
That was luck.

27:04.360 --> 27:07.600
Oh, no! I didn't expect this!

27:07.640 --> 27:11.120
Well, it's a dirty room full of junk,
what did you expect?

27:11.160 --> 27:12.000
I was expecting something horrible,
yet interesting.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.720
I was expecting something horrible,
yet interesting.

27:14.760 --> 27:18.160
Some ghastly clue
that would advance the plot.

27:18.200 --> 27:20.000
The world doesn't have a plot. Things
just happen, one after another.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.840
The world doesn't have a plot. Things
just happen, one after another.

27:21.880 --> 27:26.160
Pfft! There's always a plot.
You just have to know where to look.

27:26.200 --> 27:28.000
Ha! That's it!
A secret passage, of course!

27:28.000 --> 27:29.760
Ha! That's it!
A secret passage, of course!

27:29.800 --> 27:32.360
Everyone, look for the entrance
to the secret passage!

27:32.400 --> 27:34.360
What does a secret passage
look like?

27:34.400 --> 27:36.000
Well, it won't look like one,
of course!

27:36.000 --> 27:37.120
Well, it won't look like one,
of course!

27:37.160 --> 27:41.240
Oh, well, in that case,
I can see dozens of secret passages.

27:41.280 --> 27:44.000
Er, I don't know
how to look for something

27:44.040 --> 27:46.800
that doesn't look like
the thing I'm looking for.

27:46.840 --> 27:49.080
Agh!
I know it's a rather daring idea,

27:49.120 --> 27:51.840
but suppose there might not be
a secret passage?

27:51.880 --> 27:52.000
There has to be!
But they're hard to find.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.840
There has to be!
But they're hard to find.

27:53.880 --> 27:56.040
And then you give up,

27:56.080 --> 28:00.000
and it's when you give up and lean
against... that wall,

28:00.000 --> 28:00.120
and it's when you give up and lean
against... that wall,

28:00.160 --> 28:03.720
that you inadvertently operate
the secret switch!

28:06.640 --> 28:08.000
Huh...

28:08.000 --> 28:08.040
Huh...

28:08.080 --> 28:12.760
I'll just rest my arm innocently
on this coat hook.

28:12.800 --> 28:16.000
And look! A sudden door in the wall
miraculously...

28:16.000 --> 28:16.680
And look! A sudden door in the wall
miraculously...

28:16.720 --> 28:18.040
..fails to appear!

28:18.080 --> 28:20.200
Clearly, certain villains
totally fail to know

28:20.240 --> 28:22.360
how to design
a proper secret passage.

28:23.520 --> 28:24.000
Keith, look!

28:24.000 --> 28:25.840
Keith, look!

28:25.880 --> 28:29.440
Hey! Why is there a rat hole
in a rat-catchers' building?

28:29.480 --> 28:32.000
I wouldn't come near this place
if I were a rat.

28:32.000 --> 28:32.600
I wouldn't come near this place
if I were a rat.

28:32.640 --> 28:35.160
Yes! That often happens in stories!

28:35.200 --> 28:39.120
The stupid person comes up
with the good idea by accident!

28:40.600 --> 28:42.640
There's a sort of little lever
in there.

28:42.680 --> 28:45.800
I'll give it a... push.

28:45.840 --> 28:47.640
Agh!

28:47.680 --> 28:48.000
A trap door! Quite well-hidden.
No wonder we didn't see it!

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
A trap door! Quite well-hidden.
No wonder we didn't see it!

28:51.040 --> 28:54.200
Keith! Are you all right?
Not hurt!

28:54.240 --> 28:55.760
Much.

28:55.800 --> 28:56.000
It's a sort of a cellar.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.600
It's a sort of a cellar.

28:57.640 --> 29:00.120
I'm all right
because I landed on my head.

29:01.920 --> 29:04.000
Here's a ladder.
Why didn't you use it?

29:04.000 --> 29:04.480
Here's a ladder.
Why didn't you use it?

29:04.520 --> 29:08.000
I was unable to take advantage of it
on account of...

29:08.040 --> 29:10.560
..falling past it.

29:10.600 --> 29:12.000
Where's my hat?

29:12.000 --> 29:12.080
Where's my hat?

29:12.120 --> 29:13.640
Ahh!

29:30.560 --> 29:33.560
Oh, my goodness!
Huh?

29:33.600 --> 29:34.720
Food!

29:40.640 --> 29:43.320
Smoked ham!

29:45.080 --> 29:47.600
Mmm! So good!

29:47.640 --> 29:49.840
Wow!
Over here!

29:49.880 --> 29:51.960
I found the bakery section!

29:52.000 --> 29:55.160
So they are stealing food...

29:56.160 --> 29:58.440
..mostly at night,

29:58.480 --> 30:00.000
for some undetermined purpose.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.920
for some undetermined purpose.

30:01.960 --> 30:03.960
Those are the best mysteries!

30:04.000 --> 30:07.600
The more they are solved,
the more mysterious they get.

30:12.800 --> 30:15.080
All right, speak up.
Agh!

30:15.120 --> 30:16.000
Just say a few words.
Or a poem maybe? What about a lim...

30:16.000 --> 30:18.160
Just say a few words.
Or a poem maybe? What about a lim...

30:18.200 --> 30:20.160
Agh! Peaches!

30:20.200 --> 30:24.000
It's you!Put me down! Do you mind?
Oh! Of course!

30:24.000 --> 30:25.080
It's you!Put me down! Do you mind?
Oh! Of course!

30:25.120 --> 30:26.920
Keith! Sardines! We're in...

30:26.960 --> 30:30.560
Ah, don't worry, I know everything!

30:31.800 --> 30:32.000
We're in trouble!
You won't believe what we've found!

30:32.000 --> 30:35.320
We're in trouble!
You won't believe what we've found!

30:35.360 --> 30:37.840
I did ask you if you could talk,
didn't I?Yes, you did, but...

30:37.880 --> 30:40.000
I'm quite vigilant about asking,
you know.

30:40.040 --> 30:42.120
Yes, yes! You've made your point!
I believe you!

30:42.160 --> 30:45.440
But we're still in trouble!
Why? What's wrong?

30:49.560 --> 30:51.760
Mr Clicky?

30:51.800 --> 30:56.000
What are you doing here?When I get
my hands on that wind-up toy...

30:56.040 --> 30:58.280
Darktan! Are you hurt?

30:58.320 --> 31:00.320
Ugh!

31:00.360 --> 31:02.920
Pfffff! Just my pride.

31:02.960 --> 31:04.000
Here,

31:04.000 --> 31:04.320
Here,

31:04.360 --> 31:06.000
let me handle this.

31:06.040 --> 31:09.440
Where is he? I will crush
that useless piece of tin!

31:11.240 --> 31:12.000
Stop!

31:12.000 --> 31:13.080
Stop!

31:13.120 --> 31:15.320
I just want to talk to ya.
It won't hurt!

31:15.360 --> 31:19.640
Well, it will just a little!
Back off, Mr Too Many Belts!

31:19.680 --> 31:20.000
It's not cool to pick on
the little guys.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.120
It's not cool to pick on
the little guys.

31:22.160 --> 31:24.200
He had one job to do!

31:24.240 --> 31:27.480
You're safe with me now.

31:30.640 --> 31:33.080
Huh. So this is what they do.
Yeah.

31:33.120 --> 31:36.000
This is new. Insidious.
These traps, very cleverly designed.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.360
This is new. Insidious.
These traps, very cleverly designed.

31:38.400 --> 31:40.440
It would have to be to capture you!

31:40.480 --> 31:42.880
They are designed
to take us prisoner.

31:42.920 --> 31:44.000
Prisoner? What for?

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
Prisoner? What for?

31:45.040 --> 31:47.720
That's pretty much our business,

31:47.760 --> 31:49.280
don't you think?

31:49.320 --> 31:52.000
I knew you were a part of this!
Ha!

31:52.000 --> 31:52.400
I knew you were a part of this!
Ha!

31:52.440 --> 31:55.520
Tell us a story, story-telling girl!

31:55.560 --> 31:58.720
You're stealing food, somehow,
for some reason.

31:58.760 --> 32:00.000
To feed the rats you've captured,
maybe, and must be hiding somewhere.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.880
To feed the rats you've captured,
maybe, and must be hiding somewhere.

32:02.920 --> 32:05.880
You don't need to be clever to see
that this is a bad situation

32:05.920 --> 32:07.920
and might need running away from
quite soon.

32:07.960 --> 32:08.000
..so that's why the food
went missing.Get them!

32:08.000 --> 32:10.400
..so that's why the food
went missing.Get them!

32:11.560 --> 32:14.640
Come here!
Such as now.

32:14.680 --> 32:16.000
Oh, you think Malicia is the only
person who can comment on the story?

32:16.000 --> 32:19.440
Oh, you think Malicia is the only
person who can comment on the story?

32:23.120 --> 32:24.000
Well, she thinks the story
is about her, but it's not.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.680
Well, she thinks the story
is about her, but it's not.

32:26.720 --> 32:30.640
Check out the title
if you harbour any doubts.

32:32.080 --> 32:35.520
Oh, I hate cats!

32:35.560 --> 32:38.400
Rats served on a silver platter!

32:38.440 --> 32:40.000
Get that thing off my foot!
Boss Man will be very happy!

32:40.000 --> 32:40.600
Get that thing off my foot!
Boss Man will be very happy!

32:42.560 --> 32:45.080
And now the kids!

32:45.120 --> 32:47.720
Let go of me!
Go and tie 'em up somewhere.Let go!

32:47.760 --> 32:48.000
Hey, look! The rat.
Why is it wearing a hat?Hm?

32:48.000 --> 32:51.480
Hey, look! The rat.
Why is it wearing a hat?Hm?

32:51.520 --> 32:54.480
Huh!

32:54.520 --> 32:56.000
Billy, look at that! A show-rat!

32:56.000 --> 32:56.360
Billy, look at that! A show-rat!

32:56.400 --> 33:01.720
Oh, don't look at me like that,
like I'm abandoning my friends.

33:01.760 --> 33:04.000
I'm a cat,
and cats choose their battles wisely!

33:04.000 --> 33:06.160
I'm a cat,
and cats choose their battles wisely!

33:06.200 --> 33:09.400
Hey, Billy!
He'd be good for the pit.

33:09.440 --> 33:12.000
We'll call him The Rat With the Hat!

33:12.000 --> 33:14.360
We'll call him The Rat With the Hat!

33:30.680 --> 33:33.720
What are they keeping us for?
Normally, a rat is trapped

33:33.760 --> 33:35.200
and then...

33:35.240 --> 33:36.000
What's so funny, Dangerous Beans?

33:36.000 --> 33:38.040
What's so funny, Dangerous Beans?

33:38.080 --> 33:41.720
Maurice! I knew you wouldn't
let us down, old friend!

33:41.760 --> 33:44.000
I've always said,
"We can depend on Maurice."

33:44.000 --> 33:45.800
I've always said,
"We can depend on Maurice."

33:45.840 --> 33:47.680
Never a doubt.
Mm. Right.

33:47.720 --> 33:51.760
I saw you rush off to start looking
for us, even before we were caught!

33:52.800 --> 33:54.880
Ooh! Hey!

33:54.920 --> 33:59.440
So, what's your plan?
First, we get out of here.Excellent.

33:59.480 --> 34:00.000
Then get as far away from this town
as possible.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.880
Then get as far away from this town
as possible.

34:01.920 --> 34:04.400
Yeah. After we rescue Sardines.

34:04.440 --> 34:06.680
You left out that part.
Yes.

34:06.720 --> 34:08.000
An oversight.
Let me go over it again.

34:08.000 --> 34:08.440
An oversight.
Let me go over it again.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.280
First, we get out of here,

34:10.320 --> 34:13.480
then...
Ahem! Plus the boy and the girl.

34:13.520 --> 34:16.000
They're tied up in another cellar.
We have to rescue them, too.

34:16.000 --> 34:16.840
They're tied up in another cellar.
We have to rescue them, too.

34:16.880 --> 34:18.880
Oh! Humans, you know!

34:18.920 --> 34:21.960
They'll eventually work it all out,
deals will be struck!

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
We have to find out
where they took Sardines.

34:24.000 --> 34:24.880
We have to find out
where they took Sardines.

34:24.920 --> 34:27.960
Perhaps you heard them mention...
the pit?

34:29.880 --> 34:32.000
I was in a place once,
a storage building.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.440
I was in a place once,
a storage building.

34:33.480 --> 34:37.720
Some men came in and put a big
round wall in the middle of the floor

34:37.760 --> 34:40.000
and called it... the pit.
''

34:40.000 --> 34:40.800
and called it... the pit.
''

34:40.840 --> 34:44.920
They had a box of rats
and tipped them into the ring

34:44.960 --> 34:48.000
and then then they put in the dogs.
Terriers. ''

34:48.000 --> 34:49.120
and then then they put in the dogs.
Terriers. ''

34:49.160 --> 34:51.040
The rats fought the dogs?

34:51.080 --> 34:52.440
Fought? No.

34:52.480 --> 34:56.000
Mostly they ran around and around.
It's called rat coursing.

34:56.000 --> 34:56.400
Mostly they ran around and around.
It's called rat coursing.

34:56.440 --> 34:58.960
How is it we've never heard of this?

34:59.000 --> 35:01.920
Because there wouldn't be any rats
left to tell you.

35:07.120 --> 35:09.640
Right, then.

35:10.600 --> 35:12.000
Peaches, Dangerous Beans, Maurice,
you go free up Keith and Malicia.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.800
Peaches, Dangerous Beans, Maurice,
you go free up Keith and Malicia.

35:14.840 --> 35:17.480
Nourishing, Special Offer,
Delicious In-Brine,

35:17.520 --> 35:20.000
we rescue Sardines.
His trail will be easy to follow.

35:20.000 --> 35:20.800
we rescue Sardines.
His trail will be easy to follow.

35:22.960 --> 35:26.080
He was widdling the entire way.

35:35.920 --> 35:36.000
So, let's go over it again,
shall we?

35:36.000 --> 35:38.400
So, let's go over it again,
shall we?

35:38.440 --> 35:41.320
You don't have a knife
of any kind?

35:41.360 --> 35:44.000
None.Or some handy matches
that could burn through the rope?

35:44.000 --> 35:45.880
None.Or some handy matches
that could burn through the rope?

35:45.920 --> 35:47.440
No. Sorry.

35:47.480 --> 35:50.840
Did you even look?
I looked!

35:57.440 --> 35:59.120
You know, in many ways,

35:59.160 --> 36:00.000
I don't think the plot
of this adventure

36:00.000 --> 36:01.320
I don't think the plot
of this adventure

36:01.360 --> 36:04.120
has been properly structured.

36:06.160 --> 36:08.000
Rrrrgh!

36:08.000 --> 36:08.720
Rrrrgh!

36:27.400 --> 36:30.080
Keep the pace!

36:33.360 --> 36:36.760
All right,
I'm running out of patience.

36:36.800 --> 36:39.480
I'm gonna start to reach here.

36:39.520 --> 36:40.000
This would be the ideal time for you
to discover your secret powers!

36:40.000 --> 36:44.480
This would be the ideal time for you
to discover your secret powers!

36:44.520 --> 36:48.000
Oh! Great idea! Ah, yeah!

36:48.040 --> 36:50.000
Oh...!Yes?
I feel...

36:50.040 --> 36:52.920
Huh? Huh?

36:52.960 --> 36:55.400
No. Nothing.

36:55.440 --> 36:56.000
Ugh! Are you sure?

36:56.000 --> 36:58.160
Ugh! Are you sure?

36:58.200 --> 37:01.840
When I first saw you I thought,
"He must have some amazing power

37:01.880 --> 37:03.720
that will manifest itself
when we're in trouble."

37:03.760 --> 37:04.000
"No-one could be that useless,
unless it was a disguise!"

37:04.000 --> 37:07.400
"No-one could be that useless,
unless it was a disguise!"

37:07.440 --> 37:11.320
No! Look, I'm the kind of person
heroes aren't.

37:11.360 --> 37:12.000
I'm a cheat, part of a rat scam.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.080
I'm a cheat, part of a rat scam.

37:14.120 --> 37:15.680
What I do is play music

37:15.720 --> 37:18.880
and I do that pretty well,
thank you.

37:18.920 --> 37:20.000
But I am not a hero in disguise.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.280
But I am not a hero in disguise.

37:22.320 --> 37:24.720
Sorry to disappoint you.

37:26.080 --> 37:28.000
Oh.

37:28.000 --> 37:28.640
Oh.

37:28.680 --> 37:31.280
So, you're the commoner

37:31.320 --> 37:34.720
who has to rise to the occasion?

37:34.760 --> 37:36.000
You should've found someone else.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.720
You should've found someone else.

37:37.760 --> 37:39.360
Ow! There's something behind me!

37:39.400 --> 37:42.120
We're gnawing through the ropes!
What? Ow!

37:42.160 --> 37:44.000
Hold still!
Dangerous Beans! Peaches!

37:44.000 --> 37:45.400
Hold still!
Dangerous Beans! Peaches!

37:45.440 --> 37:50.800
It's about time!
Talking animals to the rescue!

37:50.840 --> 37:52.000
Unbelievable!
This is almost too easy!

37:52.000 --> 37:53.680
Unbelievable!
This is almost too easy!

37:53.720 --> 37:56.480
Almost like - pfft! - Mr Bunnsy.

37:56.520 --> 37:59.280
Mr Bunnsy? What about Mr Bunnsy?

37:59.320 --> 38:00.000
Oh, those are just books
for little kids!

38:00.000 --> 38:01.480
Oh, those are just books
for little kids!

38:01.520 --> 38:04.480
There's a rat and a rabbit
and a snake

38:04.520 --> 38:06.720
and they go around
having adventures.

38:06.760 --> 38:08.000
They wear clothes and talk to humans
and everyone's so nice and cosy.

38:08.000 --> 38:12.120
They wear clothes and talk to humans
and everyone's so nice and cosy.

38:12.160 --> 38:14.440
It is so silly!

38:14.480 --> 38:16.000
My father read them to me
when I was a kid.Erm...

38:16.000 --> 38:16.880
My father read them to me
when I was a kid.Erm...

38:16.920 --> 38:18.360
I think you'd better stop.

38:18.400 --> 38:22.320
Morris?Of course,
now I see how simplistic they are!

38:22.360 --> 38:24.000
No subtext, no social commentary.

38:24.000 --> 38:24.720
No subtext, no social commentary.

38:24.760 --> 38:26.880
Doris the Duck loses a shoe?

38:26.920 --> 38:30.080
You call that narrative tension?
Malicia, please stop!What?

38:30.120 --> 38:32.000
You knew! YOU KNEW!

38:32.000 --> 38:32.720
You knew! YOU KNEW!

38:32.760 --> 38:36.600
There's no island paradise.
There never was.

38:36.640 --> 38:39.400
You lied to us!
No, I...

38:39.440 --> 38:40.000
Look... No, Peaches, don't!

38:40.000 --> 38:41.800
Look... No, Peaches, don't!

38:41.840 --> 38:44.800
I never had the heart to tell you.

38:44.840 --> 38:47.960
Peaches, it's all right.No!
Peaches!

38:48.000 --> 38:50.720
Peaches? No!

38:50.760 --> 38:52.280
Peaches! Come back!

38:52.320 --> 38:55.280
Dangerous Beans, don't...
Peaches!

38:55.320 --> 38:56.000
All their hopes... dashed.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.800
All their hopes... dashed.

38:58.840 --> 39:01.120
Bad cat! BAD CAT!

39:01.160 --> 39:04.000
Oh, I hate this feeling.
That you've done something wrong?

39:04.000 --> 39:04.920
Oh, I hate this feeling.
That you've done something wrong?

39:04.960 --> 39:08.280
No! That I now need to do
something good to make up for it.

39:08.320 --> 39:12.000
Like, figure out how to get you two
past the rat-catchers.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.280
Like, figure out how to get you two
past the rat-catchers.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.760
Peaches?

39:18.440 --> 39:20.000
Peaches?

39:20.000 --> 39:21.040
Peaches?

39:21.080 --> 39:23.240
She came this way.

39:24.240 --> 39:27.920
Peaches, please!
We can work things out.

39:27.960 --> 39:28.000
The book is a lie! You lied to me!

39:28.000 --> 39:32.200
The book is a lie! You lied to me!

39:32.240 --> 39:36.000
The book is not what matters!
It's what we make of it!

39:36.000 --> 39:36.080
The book is not what matters!
It's what we make of it!

39:36.120 --> 39:37.960
Go away!

39:42.560 --> 39:44.000
I don't think we are alone
down here.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.520
I don't think we are alone
down here.

39:47.600 --> 39:51.080
If you would just stay in one place
till I get to you!

39:51.120 --> 39:52.000
Leave me alone!

39:52.000 --> 39:53.320
Leave me alone!

39:58.760 --> 40:00.000
Beans?

40:00.000 --> 40:01.560
Beans?

40:01.600 --> 40:05.320
Beans? I think there's
something else down here!

40:10.640 --> 40:13.920
Peaches!

40:31.480 --> 40:32.000
Bon appetit.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.320
Bon appetit.

40:34.360 --> 40:36.680
Hey! It's that cat!

40:36.720 --> 40:39.200
Enjoying your last supper?

40:39.240 --> 40:40.000
What?
Hey...

40:40.000 --> 40:41.440
What?
Hey...

40:41.480 --> 40:44.040
What's this? Killalot.

40:44.080 --> 40:46.520
Oh. That sounds bad.
What?!

40:46.560 --> 40:48.000
How did you...
Hey, you stole our poison!

40:48.000 --> 40:49.640
How did you...
Hey, you stole our poison!

40:49.680 --> 40:53.280
Steal? No, no, no, no,
We don't steal.

40:53.320 --> 40:54.760
We just put it somewhere else.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.000
Set that down. That's dangerous
stuff! And tell me where you put it.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.480
Set that down. That's dangerous
stuff! And tell me where you put it.

40:58.520 --> 41:01.800
Well, now that you mention it,
I think the cat there

41:01.840 --> 41:04.000
put most of it in the sugar.

41:04.000 --> 41:04.720
put most of it in the sugar.

41:06.080 --> 41:08.520
Oh, I knew that tea tasted funny.

41:08.560 --> 41:12.000
You...
Don't even think of hurting us.

41:12.000 --> 41:12.600
You...
Don't even think of hurting us.

41:12.640 --> 41:15.920
We might forget
where we left the antidote.

41:15.960 --> 41:18.280
There is no antidote to Killalot!

41:18.320 --> 41:20.000
Oh, but there is. I know a few
experts on the topic of rat poison.

41:20.000 --> 41:23.040
Oh, but there is. I know a few
experts on the topic of rat poison.

41:23.080 --> 41:24.720
Answers. Now.

41:24.760 --> 41:28.000
You caught rats alive
and crammed them into cages. Why?

41:28.000 --> 41:28.240
You caught rats alive
and crammed them into cages. Why?

41:28.280 --> 41:31.480
I can feel things happening!

41:31.520 --> 41:33.880
Don't you know anything
about poison?

41:33.920 --> 41:36.000
Your stomach won't start to melt
for about, oh, 20 minutes?

41:36.000 --> 41:38.120
Your stomach won't start to melt
for about, oh, 20 minutes?

41:38.160 --> 41:40.000
This is great stuff.

41:40.040 --> 41:42.760
Oh, this is inhuman!

41:42.800 --> 41:44.000
No, it's extremely human. Your
poisons do it to rats every day.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.600
No, it's extremely human. Your
poisons do it to rats every day.

41:46.640 --> 41:50.840
Now, tell me about the rats
in the cages.

41:50.880 --> 41:52.000
At first, we caught a few!
For the pit!

41:52.000 --> 41:54.600
At first, we caught a few!
For the pit!

41:54.640 --> 41:58.920
Then?
We accidentally made a Rat King.

41:58.960 --> 42:00.000
A Rat King?

42:00.000 --> 42:01.520
A Rat King?

42:01.560 --> 42:05.160
Is it still alive?
I've never seen him afraid before.

42:05.200 --> 42:07.560
IS IT STILL ALIVE?!

42:07.600 --> 42:08.000
Er, w-what is a Rat King?

42:08.000 --> 42:09.680
Er, w-what is a Rat King?

42:09.720 --> 42:12.640
Rat kings are deadly evil.

42:12.680 --> 42:15.760
A collection of rats, their tails
knotted together, and then...

42:15.800 --> 42:16.000
We didn't mean to.
We put a handful of rats in a bucket

42:16.000 --> 42:19.440
We didn't mean to.
We put a handful of rats in a bucket

42:19.480 --> 42:23.000
and later, when we opened the lid...

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
..there it was!

42:27.040 --> 42:31.680
The rats, together, their minds merge
to form one creature.

42:31.720 --> 42:32.000
It gains consciousness, power,
mind power.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.320
It gains consciousness, power,
mind power.

42:35.360 --> 42:38.680
It can dominate and control others.

42:38.720 --> 42:40.000
This is a game-changer.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.160
This is a game-changer.

42:41.200 --> 42:44.280
A Rat King? No. This is too much.

42:44.320 --> 42:47.600
Oh, wait! Where are you going?

42:48.920 --> 42:50.800
I, erm,

42:50.840 --> 42:53.800
I have to go and warn the others!

42:56.000 --> 42:57.760
Antidote! Antidote, please!

42:57.800 --> 43:01.440
My stomach feels like
there's rats running around in it!

43:01.480 --> 43:04.000
You don't deserve it, but we left it
in that little cellar downstairs.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.880
You don't deserve it, but we left it
in that little cellar downstairs.

43:05.920 --> 43:07.760
I should hurry if I were you.

43:14.080 --> 43:15.920
Me, too!

43:15.960 --> 43:17.880
How much poison
did Maurice give them?

43:17.920 --> 43:20.000
You mean the laxative? Lots.
Where is it?

43:20.000 --> 43:21.200
You mean the laxative? Lots.
Where is it?

43:21.240 --> 43:24.400
But they should be all right if they
don't take too much of the antidote.

43:24.440 --> 43:26.840
And what did you leave down there
for the antidote?

43:26.880 --> 43:28.000
More laxative.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.520
More laxative.

43:30.560 --> 43:32.720
I've got to find a toilet!

43:32.760 --> 43:34.400
Too late.

43:34.440 --> 43:36.000
The laxative was brilliant.

43:36.000 --> 43:36.400
The laxative was brilliant.

43:36.440 --> 43:40.160
But giving it to them as an
antidote, as well, that is...

43:40.200 --> 43:42.960
Clever? Narratively satisfying?

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
Genius!

43:44.000 --> 43:44.560
Genius!

43:44.600 --> 43:46.520
The genius part is,

43:46.560 --> 43:48.480
I know where to go next.

43:48.520 --> 43:50.240
To the forest!

43:50.280 --> 43:52.000
The Dark Wood?

43:52.000 --> 43:52.360
The Dark Wood?

43:52.400 --> 43:55.120
Well, there are trees
and it is dark.

43:55.160 --> 43:59.240
Why?
Don't you know? Don't you read?

43:59.280 --> 44:00.000
There is only one thing
that can control a Rat King.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.720
There is only one thing
that can control a Rat King.

44:01.760 --> 44:04.120
One! In the entire landscape
of literature!

44:04.160 --> 44:07.040
We have to get it
or all of us are in real trouble.

44:07.080 --> 44:08.000
What?

44:08.000 --> 44:08.720
What?

44:08.760 --> 44:12.520
The pipe of the Pied Piper.

44:12.560 --> 44:14.360
The real Pied Piper!

44:26.720 --> 44:29.480
You hear the words "Rat King"
and you get out of there.

44:29.520 --> 44:31.360
Permanently. That's the rule.

44:31.400 --> 44:32.000
Yep! Lucky me!
And what an end to the story!

44:32.000 --> 44:35.200
Yep! Lucky me!
And what an end to the story!

44:35.240 --> 44:39.520
The Amazing Maurice barely escapes
with six of his nine lives.

44:39.560 --> 44:40.000
And these little beauties, of course!

44:40.000 --> 44:43.200
And these little beauties, of course!

44:43.240 --> 44:47.040
Yep, huge advantage being a cat.

44:47.080 --> 44:48.000
Actually, it's too bad for them
they're not cats.

44:48.000 --> 44:51.880
Actually, it's too bad for them
they're not cats.

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
Hey,
why am I even thinking about them?

44:56.000 --> 44:56.240
Hey,
why am I even thinking about them?

44:56.280 --> 44:59.280
I'm not feeling guilty
about this. I'm a cat!

44:59.320 --> 45:02.800
Free to follow my own fate.
My next big adventure.

45:02.840 --> 45:04.000
I think I'll go to sea.

45:04.000 --> 45:04.080
I think I'll go to sea.

45:04.120 --> 45:06.640
Always fancied being a ship's cat.

45:06.680 --> 45:11.160
Might get a little bit sick,
I suppose, but I'll get used to it.

45:11.200 --> 45:12.000
What a twist!
And it's just getting better!

45:12.000 --> 45:14.920
What a twist!
And it's just getting better!

45:14.960 --> 45:18.040
Malicia?
You've been up here three days!

45:18.080 --> 45:19.880
Do you want some dinner?

45:19.920 --> 45:20.000
I'm coming down soon, Dad!
I promise!

45:20.000 --> 45:22.520
I'm coming down soon, Dad!
I promise!

45:22.560 --> 45:25.200
This is not the behaviour
of a normal girl.

45:25.240 --> 45:28.000
Where were we? Oh, yes. Mr Bunnsy.

45:28.000 --> 45:28.320
Where were we? Oh, yes. Mr Bunnsy.

45:28.360 --> 45:31.880
"Ratty Rupert was the bravest rat
there ever was."

45:31.920 --> 45:34.040
"Everyone in Furry Bottom said so."

45:34.080 --> 45:36.000
"So he was sent to find Mr Bunnsy."

45:36.000 --> 45:38.200
"So he was sent to find Mr Bunnsy."

45:38.240 --> 45:42.560
"Little did he know
what was waiting for him."

45:59.600 --> 46:00.000
This must be it.
Ten rats in 32 seconds!

46:00.000 --> 46:04.320
This must be it.
Ten rats in 32 seconds!

46:04.360 --> 46:07.120
Come on, give me a hand.

46:07.160 --> 46:08.000
That's a smidgen over three seconds
per rat!

46:08.000 --> 46:10.120
That's a smidgen over three seconds
per rat!

46:10.160 --> 46:14.000
Let's hear it for
The Blitz From Bad Blintz!

46:14.040 --> 46:16.000
Billy!

46:16.000 --> 46:18.120
Billy!

46:18.160 --> 46:21.480
Sardines is not far.

46:30.960 --> 46:32.000
Ready for the next round?
Yes!

46:32.000 --> 46:33.240
Ready for the next round?
Yes!

46:33.280 --> 46:34.960
Give it up for...

46:35.000 --> 46:38.800
..Jacko!

46:38.840 --> 46:40.000
Are you ready

46:40.000 --> 46:42.200
Are you ready

46:42.240 --> 46:44.400
to rattle?

46:44.440 --> 46:47.680
How long will they last?

46:49.880 --> 46:54.280
Oh, no!This is even worse
than Maurice told!

46:54.320 --> 46:56.000
Sardines is dog food.
Idiots! Work together!

46:56.000 --> 46:58.600
Sardines is dog food.
Idiots! Work together!

46:58.640 --> 47:01.240
You could strip that fleabag
to the bone!

47:03.120 --> 47:04.000
That was a quick one!

47:04.000 --> 47:05.480
That was a quick one!

47:05.520 --> 47:10.000
Six rats in 28 seconds!
Good boy!

47:10.040 --> 47:11.400
All right, folks!

47:11.440 --> 47:12.000
For tonight's main event,
we've got a real treat for you!

47:12.000 --> 47:15.240
For tonight's main event,
we've got a real treat for you!

47:15.280 --> 47:18.440
You won't have seen a rat like this
before.

47:18.480 --> 47:20.000
We call him The Rat With the Hat!

47:20.000 --> 47:22.480
We call him The Rat With the Hat!

47:24.840 --> 47:27.200
Sardines!

47:27.240 --> 47:28.000
Your fans are waiting!

47:28.000 --> 47:29.080
Your fans are waiting!

47:31.840 --> 47:35.120
Showtime!

47:35.160 --> 47:36.000
And here is the legendary champion,

47:36.000 --> 47:38.480
And here is the legendary champion,

47:38.520 --> 47:42.000
Brute the Cute!

47:42.040 --> 47:44.000
Aww!

47:44.000 --> 47:44.600
Aww!

47:49.360 --> 47:52.000
He doesn't stand a chance!
All right, all right, calm down!

47:52.000 --> 47:52.480
He doesn't stand a chance!
All right, all right, calm down!

47:52.520 --> 47:56.280
We do the Rubber-String-Thing!
You know what to do!

47:56.320 --> 47:59.480
Everyone get into position!
Um, rubber-string... what?

47:59.520 --> 48:00.000
You, come here! Attach the string!
Me?

48:00.000 --> 48:02.440
You, come here! Attach the string!
Me?

48:02.480 --> 48:04.920
I don't know if I can...
Quick! Do it!

48:04.960 --> 48:07.400
OK! All right!

48:08.600 --> 48:11.560
Ten dollars he won't last a second!

48:11.600 --> 48:13.080
Fight!

48:13.120 --> 48:15.520
Oof!

48:26.080 --> 48:28.480
Huh?

48:28.520 --> 48:32.000
Get it done!
Double the pressure, half the speed!

48:32.040 --> 48:34.840
# Dip-a-doo-ba-da, boo!

48:34.880 --> 48:38.880
What is the rat doing?
The Charleston, I think.

48:38.920 --> 48:40.000
Hurry up!
Wait!

48:40.000 --> 48:40.960
Hurry up!
Wait!

48:41.000 --> 48:43.480
# Ba-ba-ba-da, baa! #

48:43.520 --> 48:46.640
Now or never!Nearly done!
Come on!Got it!

48:46.680 --> 48:48.000
Sardines, here I come...!

48:48.000 --> 48:50.600
Sardines, here I come...!

48:50.640 --> 48:52.520
I-I... Oh, YOU!

48:52.560 --> 48:54.400
I thought that I would...

48:55.800 --> 48:56.000
Aaaggghhh!

48:56.000 --> 48:58.440
Aaaggghhh!

48:59.400 --> 49:02.520
Sardines, we'll get you out of this!

49:02.560 --> 49:04.000
Did the rat just talk?

49:04.000 --> 49:04.520
Did the rat just talk?

49:04.560 --> 49:08.000
Don't worry. Stay behind me.

49:08.040 --> 49:10.080
Don't move, I've got you! Huh?

49:13.000 --> 49:16.760
Go on, Brute, get stuck in!

49:25.320 --> 49:27.040
What are you waiting for?

49:27.080 --> 49:28.000
He's not in the right position!

49:28.000 --> 49:29.880
He's not in the right position!

49:37.600 --> 49:39.880
I know, I know...

49:39.920 --> 49:43.760
You've spent your showbusiness
career biting rats that ran away.

49:43.800 --> 49:44.000
But rats that fight back...
Huh! Huh!

49:44.000 --> 49:46.920
But rats that fight back...
Huh! Huh!

49:46.960 --> 49:49.080
..they're something new.

49:49.120 --> 49:51.000
Huh?

49:51.040 --> 49:52.000
$15 on the talking rat!

49:52.000 --> 49:54.520
$15 on the talking rat!

49:58.440 --> 50:00.000
Come on, you mutt,
or are you gonna chicken out?

50:00.000 --> 50:01.560
Come on, you mutt,
or are you gonna chicken out?

50:01.600 --> 50:04.240
Attack!

50:09.960 --> 50:13.640
Ha-ha! Smell ya later.

50:20.960 --> 50:22.520
Watch it!

50:24.920 --> 50:27.960
Oh, yes! A brawl!

50:28.000 --> 50:30.240
$20 on...

50:34.200 --> 50:38.200
Puh! Humans!

50:39.200 --> 50:40.000
Hey, little fella!

50:40.000 --> 50:41.640
Hey, little fella!

50:41.680 --> 50:44.160
Come on, then.

50:55.600 --> 50:56.000
All in one piece? Good.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.560
All in one piece? Good.

50:57.600 --> 51:00.520
Thanks, Darktan!
Thanks to all of you!

51:00.560 --> 51:02.080
Mm...

51:05.760 --> 51:08.880
Ha! Welcome to the rescue squad!
Mission completed!

51:08.920 --> 51:12.000
Let's go! But stay frosty!

51:12.000 --> 51:12.160
Let's go! But stay frosty!

51:45.320 --> 51:47.920
What is that, that tune?

51:47.960 --> 51:51.600
Huh? Oh, sorry, was feeling nervous.
It helps me...

51:51.640 --> 51:52.000
Agh! ..if I play. Oof! Ow!

51:52.000 --> 51:55.920
Agh! ..if I play. Oof! Ow!

51:55.960 --> 51:58.920
Mm, it was nice.

52:02.400 --> 52:06.200
Say, do you have a princess, or
someone else you are in love with,

52:06.240 --> 52:08.000
who might be impressed
by your heroics?

52:08.000 --> 52:09.560
who might be impressed
by your heroics?

52:09.600 --> 52:11.840
No, I do not.

52:11.880 --> 52:14.080
Oh, that's too bad,

52:14.120 --> 52:16.000
otherwise you and I
might have been an item.

52:16.000 --> 52:16.360
otherwise you and I
might have been an item.

52:16.400 --> 52:20.720
How could my having someone else
mean I'm right for you?

52:20.760 --> 52:24.000
Plot complications!
Every story needs them.

52:24.000 --> 52:24.440
Plot complications!
Every story needs them.

52:26.040 --> 52:28.600
If you were doing this
for someone else,

52:28.640 --> 52:31.120
I would be the girl
right in front of you

52:31.160 --> 52:32.000
who's obviously much better for you
but you don't see it

52:32.000 --> 52:34.600
who's obviously much better for you
but you don't see it

52:34.640 --> 52:37.600
and you would realise in the end.

52:37.640 --> 52:40.000
But since there isn't anyone else,
I'm not that girl.

52:40.000 --> 52:41.800
But since there isn't anyone else,
I'm not that girl.

52:43.600 --> 52:45.120
Malicia,

52:45.160 --> 52:47.280
this isn't some story.

52:49.720 --> 52:52.680
That's what everyone's been
trying to tell you.

52:53.800 --> 52:56.000
Listen, orphan boy,
who was probably a changeling fairy

52:56.000 --> 52:56.960
Listen, orphan boy,
who was probably a changeling fairy

52:57.000 --> 52:59.080
and that's why you can play
amazing music,

52:59.120 --> 53:00.920
I'll tell you something!

53:00.960 --> 53:02.960
I know about real life.

53:03.000 --> 53:04.000
I know people think I'm silly,

53:04.000 --> 53:04.560
I know people think I'm silly,

53:04.600 --> 53:06.920
but you know what?

53:06.960 --> 53:09.800
Aaaggghhh!

53:09.840 --> 53:12.000
If you don't turn your life
into a story,

53:12.000 --> 53:12.040
If you don't turn your life
into a story,

53:12.080 --> 53:15.720
you become part
of someone else's story!

53:20.520 --> 53:24.080
And what if your story
doesn't go anywhere?

53:24.120 --> 53:26.320
But it will. It always does.

53:26.360 --> 53:28.000
It has to go somewhere.

53:28.000 --> 53:28.640
It has to go somewhere.

53:32.040 --> 53:35.280
There!

54:01.520 --> 54:03.960
There he is!

54:04.000 --> 54:06.400
That's dedication!

54:06.440 --> 54:08.000
He wears his Pied Piper outfit
even in his down time.

54:08.000 --> 54:11.840
He wears his Pied Piper outfit
even in his down time.

54:11.880 --> 54:14.320
He looks...

54:14.360 --> 54:16.000
..somewhat intense!

54:16.000 --> 54:16.800
..somewhat intense!

54:16.840 --> 54:18.920
He did once get upset
about an unpaid bill

54:18.960 --> 54:22.320
and magicked an entire town's worth
of children into the woods,

54:22.360 --> 54:24.000
never to be found!

54:24.000 --> 54:24.520
never to be found!

54:24.560 --> 54:26.920
And why did you not tell me that

54:26.960 --> 54:29.560
before now?

54:30.560 --> 54:32.000
The original fairy tales
are the best.

54:32.000 --> 54:33.440
The original fairy tales
are the best.

54:33.480 --> 54:36.680
Really quite brutal.

54:44.640 --> 54:46.240
There it is!

54:46.280 --> 54:48.000
That's the pipe!

54:48.000 --> 54:48.560
That's the pipe!

55:03.320 --> 55:04.000
Ooh, nice!

55:04.000 --> 55:04.640
Ooh, nice!

55:08.360 --> 55:10.280
Yep. That's it, all right.

55:10.320 --> 55:12.000
I bet he has the whole forest
under his spell.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.560
I bet he has the whole forest
under his spell.

55:15.560 --> 55:17.960
Peaches?

55:19.360 --> 55:20.000
Peaches?

55:20.000 --> 55:21.680
Peaches?

55:23.040 --> 55:25.560
Peaches?

55:27.640 --> 55:28.000
'Hello, Dangerous Beans.'

55:28.000 --> 55:30.520
'Hello, Dangerous Beans.'

55:30.560 --> 55:32.640
What?

55:32.680 --> 55:36.000
Where are you? Show me!
Let me smell you!

55:36.040 --> 55:39.200
'I'm in your head.'
What? How?

55:39.240 --> 55:42.720
'See that small tunnel
to your right?'

55:42.760 --> 55:44.000
'Enter it.'

55:44.000 --> 55:45.040
'Enter it.'

55:46.360 --> 55:50.400
'I'm up here, Dangerous Beans.'

55:50.440 --> 55:52.000
'Come to me.'

55:52.000 --> 55:52.240
'Come to me.'

55:52.280 --> 55:57.200
Why?'Someone I think you know
is waiting for you.'

56:02.960 --> 56:05.880
"And as night fell,

56:05.920 --> 56:07.920
Mr Bunnsy remembered,

56:07.960 --> 56:08.000
"There's something terrible

56:08.000 --> 56:11.120
"There's something terrible

56:11.160 --> 56:14.280
in the Dark Wood!"

56:15.800 --> 56:16.000
Ominous!

56:16.000 --> 56:19.280
Ominous!

56:40.840 --> 56:44.320
Hello, Dangerous Beans.

56:44.360 --> 56:46.480
How do you know my name?

56:46.520 --> 56:48.000
I know you better
than you might think.

56:48.000 --> 56:49.920
I know you better
than you might think.

56:49.960 --> 56:53.760
And, oh, the ability
to read your thoughts does help.

56:53.800 --> 56:56.000
Where is Peaches?

56:56.000 --> 56:56.440
Where is Peaches?

56:56.480 --> 56:58.000
Safe.

56:58.040 --> 56:59.600
Where is she?

56:59.640 --> 57:04.000
Safe, I said!
I'm keeping her quite close.

57:04.000 --> 57:04.320
Safe, I said!
I'm keeping her quite close.

57:06.760 --> 57:09.920
Oh, don't be afraid!
Rather the opposite.

57:09.960 --> 57:12.000
I would like that you would join me.

57:12.000 --> 57:12.480
I would like that you would join me.

57:12.520 --> 57:13.600
Join you?

57:13.640 --> 57:17.120
You are a marvel, Dangerous Beans.

57:17.160 --> 57:20.000
You have a mind to rival my own,

57:20.000 --> 57:20.160
You have a mind to rival my own,

57:20.200 --> 57:23.400
a mind that is thoughtful and wise.

57:23.440 --> 57:27.720
A mind that thinks for many rats,
not just one.

57:27.760 --> 57:28.000
Oh, I send them out each night
to steal food.

57:28.000 --> 57:31.960
Oh, I send them out each night
to steal food.

57:32.000 --> 57:36.000
The rats grow stronger,
the humans grow weaker.

57:36.000 --> 57:36.240
The rats grow stronger,
the humans grow weaker.

57:36.280 --> 57:41.280
That is the answer to your mystery!

57:41.320 --> 57:44.000
Mm... One mind is only as strong
as one mind

57:44.000 --> 57:47.040
Mm... One mind is only as strong
as one mind

57:47.080 --> 57:49.760
and two minds are as strong as two,

57:49.800 --> 57:52.000
but put three minds together...

57:52.000 --> 57:52.160
but put three minds together...

57:52.200 --> 57:54.800
..three minds are four minds

57:54.840 --> 57:58.240
and four minds are eight minds...

57:58.280 --> 58:00.000
..AND EIGHT MINDS ARE...

58:00.000 --> 58:02.840
..AND EIGHT MINDS ARE...

58:02.880 --> 58:05.200
..one.

58:06.280 --> 58:08.000
Where is Peaches?

58:08.000 --> 58:08.960
Where is Peaches?

58:10.720 --> 58:14.000
No! Help me! Help!

58:14.040 --> 58:16.000
Peaches! Peaches, I'm here!
Help me!It's all right!

58:16.000 --> 58:16.800
Peaches! Peaches, I'm here!
Help me!It's all right!

58:16.840 --> 58:20.120
It's all right, Peaches, I'm here.
Yes. Yes.

58:20.160 --> 58:22.600
You are here.

58:22.640 --> 58:24.000
Well, we want the same things,
you and I.

58:24.000 --> 58:27.080
Well, we want the same things,
you and I.

58:27.120 --> 58:28.840
We have plans.

58:28.880 --> 58:32.000
We want the triumph of rats
over humans!

58:32.000 --> 58:33.200
We want the triumph of rats
over humans!

58:33.240 --> 58:35.680
I harbour a somewhat
different dream.

58:35.720 --> 58:37.920
Individual rats and humans,

58:37.960 --> 58:40.000
living together in peace,
respect and harmony.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.120
living together in peace,
respect and harmony.

58:42.160 --> 58:46.000
Like in a story book?

58:47.480 --> 58:48.000
Yes. Exactly like in a story book.

58:48.000 --> 58:51.160
Yes. Exactly like in a story book.

58:51.200 --> 58:55.160
Complete with a happy ending.
Meow!

58:55.200 --> 58:56.000
Ugh!

58:56.000 --> 58:56.880
Ugh!

59:05.440 --> 59:08.600
Oh, you want to buy your way out?

59:08.640 --> 59:10.840
Hm, something like...

59:10.880 --> 59:12.000
..that!

59:12.000 --> 59:12.640
..that!

59:18.280 --> 59:20.000
Agh!
Morris!It's Maurice.

59:20.000 --> 59:23.640
Agh!
Morris!It's Maurice.

59:23.680 --> 59:25.280
Ah, you silly cat!

59:25.320 --> 59:28.000
Let's go!
Beans! Come on!

59:28.000 --> 59:28.720
Let's go!
Beans! Come on!

59:28.760 --> 59:31.840
Silly rat... Silly rat...
Silly Rat... Silly Rat...

59:31.880 --> 59:35.520
I can force you to join me.

59:35.560 --> 59:36.000
Join me... Join... Join... Join...

59:36.000 --> 59:39.360
Join me... Join... Join... Join...

59:39.400 --> 59:42.800
You'll never fit through!
I'm a cat! If my head fits,

59:42.840 --> 59:44.000
the rest will follow!

59:44.000 --> 59:44.840
the rest will follow!

59:46.880 --> 59:50.080
It's futile to run
when I'm in your heads!

59:54.320 --> 59:57.920
Don't worry!
A cat always lands on its feet!

59:57.960 --> 1:00:00.000
Agh!
Aaaggghhh!

1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:00.240
Agh!
Aaaggghhh!

1:00:02.800 --> 1:00:04.360
Agh!

1:00:04.400 --> 1:00:07.520
Oof!

1:00:07.560 --> 1:00:08.000
Ah! Maurice!

1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:08.760
Ah! Maurice!

1:00:08.800 --> 1:00:11.520
Amazing Maurice.

1:00:11.560 --> 1:00:15.760
We have to get out of here!
Get out of town! Fast!

1:00:15.800 --> 1:00:16.000
Whoa! Oof!

1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:17.560
Whoa! Oof!

1:00:17.600 --> 1:00:21.120
What about Keith and Malicia?
We're dealing with a Rat King!

1:00:21.160 --> 1:00:23.200
A Rat King?! Oh, no!

1:00:23.240 --> 1:00:24.000
OK, they can catch up.

1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:25.640
OK, they can catch up.

1:00:37.080 --> 1:00:39.240
I'll distract him.
You grab the pipe.

1:00:39.280 --> 1:00:40.000
What? He's already asleep.

1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:41.600
What? He's already asleep.

1:00:41.640 --> 1:00:44.520
Well, then, I've done my part.

1:01:02.200 --> 1:01:04.000
I didn't do it mama, I sw...
Mmmmm!

1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:05.360
I didn't do it mama, I sw...
Mmmmm!

1:01:05.400 --> 1:01:07.960
I did...

1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:22.000
Wow!

1:01:22.040 --> 1:01:23.560
Look out!

1:01:23.600 --> 1:01:25.440
Huh?

1:01:27.680 --> 1:01:28.000
I'm sorry, Mr Piper,
but I'm afraid I must insist

1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:30.360
I'm sorry, Mr Piper,
but I'm afraid I must insist

1:01:30.400 --> 1:01:32.160
that you hand over that pipe.

1:01:32.200 --> 1:01:35.320
Oh, now, is that so?

1:01:35.360 --> 1:01:36.000
Yes, that is so!

1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:36.920
Yes, that is so!

1:01:36.960 --> 1:01:42.600
Or else I've got this
and I'm not afraid to use it!

1:01:42.640 --> 1:01:44.000
That's a fork.

1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:44.680
That's a fork.

1:01:44.720 --> 1:01:47.480
A knife would be too sharp
to carry around in my bag,

1:01:47.520 --> 1:01:49.720
so it makes sense for me
to use a fork.

1:01:49.760 --> 1:01:51.520
Sir?

1:01:51.560 --> 1:01:52.000
Did you really
steal a town full of children?

1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:55.640
Did you really
steal a town full of children?

1:01:55.680 --> 1:01:59.040
Half the things they say about me
are not true!

1:01:59.080 --> 1:02:00.000
Well, that's a relief!
No!

1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:01.440
Well, that's a relief!
No!

1:02:01.480 --> 1:02:04.440
He didn't say which half.
Clever girl!

1:02:04.480 --> 1:02:08.000
And you look tasty, too!Uh-oh!
I think he just told us which half.

1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:09.080
And you look tasty, too!Uh-oh!
I think he just told us which half.

1:02:09.120 --> 1:02:12.680
Out to the oven, both of you!

1:02:12.720 --> 1:02:14.640
Ugh!

1:02:14.680 --> 1:02:16.000
I think he got us!

1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:18.000
I think he got us!

1:02:20.320 --> 1:02:22.360
Whaaa? The oven?

1:02:22.400 --> 1:02:24.000
This is so Hansel and Gretel.

1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:24.880
This is so Hansel and Gretel.

1:02:27.360 --> 1:02:29.480
Now's about the time

1:02:29.520 --> 1:02:32.000
a character we almost forgot
will appear unexpectedly

1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:33.120
a character we almost forgot
will appear unexpectedly

1:02:33.160 --> 1:02:35.960
to pay his debt and save the day!

1:02:39.520 --> 1:02:40.000
Looks like your story
doesn't have a happy end.

1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:43.560
Looks like your story
doesn't have a happy end.

1:02:43.600 --> 1:02:47.120
In that case, Keith,

1:02:47.160 --> 1:02:48.000
this would be the perfect moment
for you to confess

1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:50.560
this would be the perfect moment
for you to confess

1:02:50.600 --> 1:02:53.560
how you truly feel about me.

1:02:53.600 --> 1:02:56.000
How I truly feel about you?

1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:56.320
How I truly feel about you?

1:02:56.360 --> 1:02:57.880
Mm-hm!

1:02:59.920 --> 1:03:02.920
Most of the time,

1:03:02.960 --> 1:03:04.000
fairly annoyed.

1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:05.200
fairly annoyed.

1:03:15.400 --> 1:03:18.320
Agh!

1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:44.000
Aaaggghhh...

1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:45.880
Aaaggghhh...

1:03:49.800 --> 1:03:52.000
I knew I could count on you,
Mr Clicky!

1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:53.720
I knew I could count on you,
Mr Clicky!

1:03:53.760 --> 1:03:55.280
We got it! Let's go!

1:03:55.320 --> 1:03:58.400
Now they have the rare
and precious weapon

1:03:58.440 --> 1:04:00.000
to defeat the evil Rat King!

1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:01.920
to defeat the evil Rat King!

1:04:01.960 --> 1:04:05.200
Everybody, hurry!
What's all the fuss about?

1:04:05.240 --> 1:04:07.480
A Rat King?
Well, that doesn't sound so bad.

1:04:07.520 --> 1:04:08.000
It is, believe me.
We need to beat it pronto.

1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:11.200
It is, believe me.
We need to beat it pronto.

1:04:11.240 --> 1:04:13.800
A dead end! How do we get out?

1:04:13.840 --> 1:04:16.000
Everybody, calm down! Please!

1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:16.760
Everybody, calm down! Please!

1:04:16.800 --> 1:04:21.360
Quiet! I'm trying to think!

1:04:21.400 --> 1:04:23.720
Agh!

1:04:23.760 --> 1:04:24.000
Hey! Watch it!
You watch it!

1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:27.160
Hey! Watch it!
You watch it!

1:04:28.440 --> 1:04:30.280
One rat can think, right?

1:04:30.320 --> 1:04:32.000
But a bunch of rats
is just a big animal

1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:32.520
But a bunch of rats
is just a big animal

1:04:32.560 --> 1:04:35.520
with lots of legs and no brain.

1:04:37.320 --> 1:04:40.000
As soon as there's trouble,
we're just... rats.

1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:42.080
As soon as there's trouble,
we're just... rats.

1:04:42.120 --> 1:04:45.120
If it's any help, I'm just a cat.

1:04:45.160 --> 1:04:47.680
Oh, you are not "just a cat",
Maurice.

1:04:47.720 --> 1:04:48.000
Well, we've always wondered
how I got changed,

1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:51.080
Well, we've always wondered
how I got changed,

1:04:51.120 --> 1:04:54.320
even though I never ate any magical
rubbish from the wizard's dump.

1:04:54.360 --> 1:04:55.520
Yesss?

1:04:55.560 --> 1:04:56.000
A mystery.
Well, er, now might be the time.

1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:59.080
A mystery.
Well, er, now might be the time.

1:04:59.120 --> 1:05:01.840
Did you ever know a rat, quite big,
one ear missing,

1:05:01.880 --> 1:05:04.000
had a bit of a speech difficulty?

1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:04.120
had a bit of a speech difficulty?

1:05:04.160 --> 1:05:07.480
Oh, that sounds like Additives.
Right?

1:05:07.520 --> 1:05:09.240
Oh, no!

1:05:09.280 --> 1:05:12.000
All right! All right! I ate him!

1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:12.880
All right! All right! I ate him!

1:05:15.600 --> 1:05:18.760
I hadn't learned to think yet!
I was hungry!

1:05:18.800 --> 1:05:20.000
I ate him and then I got changed,
too!

1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:21.280
I ate him and then I got changed,
too!

1:05:21.320 --> 1:05:25.240
I admit it! It wasn't my fault.
I was just a cat.

1:05:25.280 --> 1:05:27.440
Are you sorry?
Sorry?

1:05:27.480 --> 1:05:28.000
Cats are never sorry.
They never regret anything!

1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:30.360
Cats are never sorry.
They never regret anything!

1:05:30.400 --> 1:05:34.240
Except... Except, I do!

1:05:34.280 --> 1:05:36.000
Then, it is all right. Probably.

1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:37.680
Then, it is all right. Probably.

1:05:37.720 --> 1:05:40.920
Yo, Maurice! Give me a hand!

1:05:45.360 --> 1:05:48.520
Quick!Right, let's get out of here
once and for all!

1:05:55.920 --> 1:05:57.800
What's wrong?
There...

1:05:57.840 --> 1:05:59.880
Hello there!

1:05:59.920 --> 1:06:00.000
Oh! Retreat!

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:01.640
Oh! Retreat!

1:06:01.680 --> 1:06:06.240
Back away, everyone!Oh, please,
don't run off! You've just arrived.

1:06:06.280 --> 1:06:08.000
Enough with the masquerade!
Show yourself!

1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:09.520
Enough with the masquerade!
Show yourself!

1:06:09.560 --> 1:06:11.640
Oh, you want to see me?

1:06:11.680 --> 1:06:12.840
Well,

1:06:12.880 --> 1:06:16.000
here I am!

1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:16.840
here I am!

1:06:21.440 --> 1:06:24.000
Agh!

1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:24.480
Agh!

1:06:48.040 --> 1:06:52.960
Do you see me, white rat,
in your misty eyesight?

1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:56.000
Yes, you do see me.

1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:58.000
Yes, you do see me.

1:07:01.920 --> 1:07:04.000
And now, come to me,

1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:04.840
And now, come to me,

1:07:04.880 --> 1:07:07.520
my little bunnies!

1:07:09.520 --> 1:07:12.000
What is happening?
I don't know!

1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:13.040
What is happening?
I don't know!

1:07:17.240 --> 1:07:18.800
Busy day?

1:07:21.160 --> 1:07:24.360
No, come on, everyone.
You have to fight it!

1:07:24.400 --> 1:07:26.880
He's too strong!

1:07:26.920 --> 1:07:28.000
Maurice, you could get away.

1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:29.600
Maurice, you could get away.

1:07:29.640 --> 1:07:34.400
No! No! I-I would rather stay
and stand with my friends.

1:07:34.440 --> 1:07:36.000
Er, no, actually,
you could probably get away.What?

1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:37.280
Er, no, actually,
you could probably get away.What?

1:07:37.320 --> 1:07:41.440
And go get help.But we still give
you credit for your noble stance.

1:07:41.480 --> 1:07:43.080
But I...

1:07:45.480 --> 1:07:48.720
Ah, that fluffy tail is probably
the last we'll ever see of him.

1:07:48.760 --> 1:07:52.000
Yep.Bye-bye.Good riddance!
Ahem! Pardon me!

1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:52.480
Yep.Bye-bye.Good riddance!
Ahem! Pardon me!

1:07:52.520 --> 1:07:55.360
Can we continue? Fine.

1:07:55.400 --> 1:07:58.400
Come to me!

1:08:08.320 --> 1:08:10.000
Maurice!
Keith!

1:08:10.040 --> 1:08:13.400
We've got the Pied Piper's pipe
and we're headed back to town.

1:08:13.440 --> 1:08:16.000
Good! I'm off to find
Keith and Malicia

1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:16.480
Good! I'm off to find
Keith and Malicia

1:08:16.520 --> 1:08:18.760
and lead them back
to battle the Rat King!

1:08:18.800 --> 1:08:23.560
Yes! Go! Go!Right! Go! Go!
OK, bye!

1:08:28.480 --> 1:08:31.400
Yeah, let's call that
a heat-of-the-moment fail.

1:08:31.440 --> 1:08:32.000
Yes, that never happened.Let's never
mention that, ever, to anyone.

1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:36.240
Yes, that never happened.Let's never
mention that, ever, to anyone.

1:08:36.280 --> 1:08:39.840
Deal! So one more time.

1:08:39.880 --> 1:08:40.000
Maurice! We have the pipe!

1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:41.840
Maurice! We have the pipe!

1:08:41.880 --> 1:08:44.960
The Rat King is on the attack!
Follow me!

1:08:50.920 --> 1:08:53.680
Come!

1:08:53.720 --> 1:08:55.960
COME!

1:08:57.200 --> 1:08:59.880
Hey, watch out!
Oh, no!

1:08:59.920 --> 1:09:03.600
Together, we will be strong!

1:09:03.640 --> 1:09:04.000
Oh, no!

1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:05.840
Oh, no!

1:09:05.880 --> 1:09:07.680
I got you!

1:09:07.720 --> 1:09:10.200
Your offer is interesting,

1:09:10.240 --> 1:09:12.000
but what of those who aren't strong?

1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:12.680
but what of those who aren't strong?

1:09:15.160 --> 1:09:17.480
Agh!

1:09:17.520 --> 1:09:19.920
Delicious!
This tickles!

1:09:19.960 --> 1:09:20.000
Delicious indeed! The weak are food.
That is how it has always been.

1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:26.640
Delicious indeed! The weak are food.
That is how it has always been.

1:09:26.680 --> 1:09:28.000
A-ha-ha!
Things are becoming clearer.

1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:29.120
A-ha-ha!
Things are becoming clearer.

1:09:29.160 --> 1:09:32.400
No! Ugh! Fight him! For our lives!

1:09:32.440 --> 1:09:34.280
For our future!

1:09:34.320 --> 1:09:36.000
Yes, join us! I have great plans!

1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:38.880
Yes, join us! I have great plans!

1:09:38.920 --> 1:09:43.800
You only have plans!
Well, I have dreams!

1:09:43.840 --> 1:09:44.000
You defy me?

1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:45.480
You defy me?

1:09:45.520 --> 1:09:47.680
Excuse me?!
What was that?

1:09:48.880 --> 1:09:50.480
Over here!

1:09:50.520 --> 1:09:52.000
You?! Mayor's daughter,
ya foolish child!

1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:54.960
You?! Mayor's daughter,
ya foolish child!

1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:57.040
Will you please be quiet?

1:09:57.080 --> 1:10:00.000
What?Your voice, it's so loud!
Just shut up!

1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:01.360
What?Your voice, it's so loud!
Just shut up!

1:10:01.400 --> 1:10:03.680
I'm trying to hear the music.

1:10:03.720 --> 1:10:05.040
Music?

1:10:05.080 --> 1:10:06.760
That's right. Music.

1:10:06.800 --> 1:10:08.000
A collection of tonal vibrations
of varying durations,

1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:09.600
A collection of tonal vibrations
of varying durations,

1:10:09.640 --> 1:10:10.800
arranged in a pleasant,

1:10:10.840 --> 1:10:13.440
some might even say compelling,
order.

1:10:32.080 --> 1:10:34.840
No! No! Agh!

1:10:37.160 --> 1:10:40.000
Malicia,
are you sure this is going to work?

1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:40.200
Malicia,
are you sure this is going to work?

1:10:40.240 --> 1:10:43.480
But of course. You just wait.

1:10:57.040 --> 1:11:01.840
Humans...
Humans are the vermin of this world.

1:11:01.880 --> 1:11:04.000
Aaaggghhh!

1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:04.280
Aaaggghhh!

1:11:04.320 --> 1:11:05.960
Keith!

1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:09.680
Humans have tortured and poisoned
and killed,

1:11:09.720 --> 1:11:12.000
and all of that is now given form
in me.

1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:14.280
and all of that is now given form
in me.

1:11:14.320 --> 1:11:18.040
We must live alongside the humans!

1:11:18.080 --> 1:11:20.000
They trap and course us
for pleasure.

1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:21.360
They trap and course us
for pleasure.

1:11:21.400 --> 1:11:25.760
We will teach them to respect
who we are.Arrrgh!

1:11:25.800 --> 1:11:28.000
Oh, yes, we will.

1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:28.200
Oh, yes, we will.

1:11:28.240 --> 1:11:30.560
With fear!

1:11:30.600 --> 1:11:33.280
Keith! Keith! Keith!

1:11:33.320 --> 1:11:34.320
Oy! Keith!

1:11:34.360 --> 1:11:36.000
Oh, why didn't it work?

1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:37.280
Oh, why didn't it work?

1:11:37.320 --> 1:11:39.920
Keith, this is your story arc.

1:11:39.960 --> 1:11:42.000
Remember what you've learned
and use it!

1:11:42.040 --> 1:11:44.000
But I haven't learned anything!

1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:45.160
But I haven't learned anything!

1:11:45.200 --> 1:11:48.240
Go get him!
Ugh! OK!

1:11:48.280 --> 1:11:51.440
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Nourishing!

1:11:51.480 --> 1:11:52.000
This suuuucks!

1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:53.560
This suuuucks!

1:11:53.600 --> 1:11:55.280
Ugh!

1:11:55.320 --> 1:11:56.720
Whaaaa!

1:11:56.760 --> 1:11:59.280
Oof!
Ugh!

1:11:59.320 --> 1:12:00.000
Sardines! Stop!

1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:00.840
Sardines! Stop!

1:12:00.880 --> 1:12:04.920
I'm taking my final bow!

1:12:04.960 --> 1:12:06.600
Ugh!

1:12:07.600 --> 1:12:08.000
And we would rule
that rat world together,

1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:11.880
And we would rule
that rat world together,

1:12:11.920 --> 1:12:13.000
would we?

1:12:13.040 --> 1:12:15.640
We would... co-operate.

1:12:15.680 --> 1:12:16.000
Yeah, right!
You co-operate, he rules!

1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:19.280
Yeah, right!
You co-operate, he rules!

1:12:19.320 --> 1:12:21.920
Smart cat.

1:12:23.640 --> 1:12:24.000
The stupid kid is making me
seriously angry!

1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:27.920
The stupid kid is making me
seriously angry!

1:12:27.960 --> 1:12:30.440
One moment.

1:12:32.440 --> 1:12:36.040
Oh, you really shouldn't have!

1:12:37.080 --> 1:12:39.000
You obviously do not know

1:12:39.040 --> 1:12:40.000
how a proper showdown ends
for the bad guy!

1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:42.040
how a proper showdown ends
for the bad guy!

1:12:42.080 --> 1:12:43.280
You'll be...

1:12:43.320 --> 1:12:46.240
..destroyed!
Malicia!

1:12:46.280 --> 1:12:48.000
You talk too much!

1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:48.920
You talk too much!

1:12:48.960 --> 1:12:52.000
Now, where were we?
Oh, yes.

1:12:52.040 --> 1:12:55.160
Join me!

1:12:55.200 --> 1:12:56.000
Malicia?

1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:57.160
Malicia?

1:12:57.200 --> 1:12:58.480
Mm?

1:13:01.120 --> 1:13:02.960
Keith!

1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:04.000
I'm sorry, the pipe,
it's not working.

1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:07.880
I'm sorry, the pipe,
it's not working.

1:13:07.920 --> 1:13:11.640
It's not the pipe, stupid.

1:13:11.680 --> 1:13:12.000
Huh?

1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:12.880
Huh?

1:13:13.920 --> 1:13:16.920
Just play.

1:13:20.160 --> 1:13:22.160
OK.

1:13:22.200 --> 1:13:24.720
You will obey me!

1:13:24.760 --> 1:13:27.360
Never!

1:13:28.800 --> 1:13:31.840
Then, feel my pain!

1:13:41.040 --> 1:13:43.560
Er... Mm...

1:13:43.600 --> 1:13:44.000
W-What's that?

1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:47.200
W-What's that?

1:13:47.240 --> 1:13:49.480
Oh, it's, er...

1:13:49.520 --> 1:13:51.880
You!

1:13:51.920 --> 1:13:52.000
Huh?

1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:53.200
Huh?

1:13:53.240 --> 1:13:57.400
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

1:13:58.560 --> 1:14:00.000
Uh! Uh! No, no! Enough! Enough!

1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:00.960
Uh! Uh! No, no! Enough! Enough!

1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:03.240
Enough!

1:14:03.280 --> 1:14:07.760
Ahh, it's beautiful!

1:14:09.840 --> 1:14:14.200
Sweet music!

1:14:14.240 --> 1:14:16.000
Sweet, sweet music.

1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:18.560
Sweet, sweet music.

1:14:20.880 --> 1:14:22.840
Over here! Hurry!

1:14:22.880 --> 1:14:24.000
Everybody, this way, fast!

1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:25.880
Everybody, this way, fast!

1:14:28.040 --> 1:14:31.320
Looks like someone discovered
his secret power.

1:14:48.560 --> 1:14:51.280
That is beyond ugly!

1:14:51.320 --> 1:14:54.160
Well played, Piper.

1:14:54.200 --> 1:14:56.000
Well played!
But your music cannot break...

1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:59.960
Well played!
But your music cannot break...

1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:02.120
..me!

1:15:11.840 --> 1:15:12.000
Come now, Dangerous Beans.
It is time.

1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:17.640
Come now, Dangerous Beans.
It is time.

1:15:17.680 --> 1:15:20.000
No! You are nothing but darkness!

1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:21.400
No! You are nothing but darkness!

1:15:21.440 --> 1:15:24.680
And you are nothing but a rat!

1:15:24.720 --> 1:15:26.520
I am more than a rat!

1:15:26.560 --> 1:15:28.000
If I am not more than a rat,

1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:30.120
If I am not more than a rat,

1:15:30.160 --> 1:15:32.680
I am nothing at all!

1:15:32.720 --> 1:15:36.000
Then, be...

1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:36.360
Then, be...

1:15:36.400 --> 1:15:38.520
..nothing.

1:15:38.560 --> 1:15:39.680
Agh!

1:15:44.960 --> 1:15:48.160
Maurice, my friend,

1:15:48.200 --> 1:15:51.720
maybe now it's a good time to be...

1:15:52.560 --> 1:15:54.880
..just a cat.

1:15:57.960 --> 1:16:00.000
You see,

1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:00.120
You see,

1:16:00.160 --> 1:16:03.040
the Amazing Maurice, that's me,

1:16:03.080 --> 1:16:06.360
had longed to be a proper cat
for months.

1:16:06.400 --> 1:16:08.000
I have so much bottled-up
ancestral fight and viciousness

1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:11.440
I have so much bottled-up
ancestral fight and viciousness

1:16:11.480 --> 1:16:16.000
flowing through my veins,
it sparks off my claws!

1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:16.320
flowing through my veins,
it sparks off my claws!

1:16:19.520 --> 1:16:23.400
The Rat King sends all of his power,

1:16:23.440 --> 1:16:24.000
enough to bring down a tiger!

1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:27.320
enough to bring down a tiger!

1:16:27.360 --> 1:16:31.080
But now, just for a few seconds,

1:16:31.120 --> 1:16:32.000
this particular cat
could bring down a tiger

1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:34.440
this particular cat
could bring down a tiger

1:16:34.480 --> 1:16:37.000
all on...

1:16:37.040 --> 1:16:39.720
..his own!

1:16:40.960 --> 1:16:43.400
Eurgh!

1:16:43.440 --> 1:16:47.960
Rrrggghhh!

1:17:08.520 --> 1:17:10.840
Beans! No!

1:17:10.880 --> 1:17:12.000
Did you save him?

1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:12.600
Did you save him?

1:17:12.640 --> 1:17:14.880
I tried to save him.

1:17:17.680 --> 1:17:19.520
Beans?

1:17:19.560 --> 1:17:20.000
Beans?!
Dangerous Beans?

1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:22.320
Beans?!
Dangerous Beans?

1:17:22.360 --> 1:17:24.760
Please, no!

1:17:45.560 --> 1:17:49.120
Bone Rat.
Also known as The Grim Squeaker.

1:17:49.160 --> 1:17:52.000
You've come for Dangerous Beans,
I suppose?

1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:52.600
You've come for Dangerous Beans,
I suppose?

1:17:52.640 --> 1:17:56.120
No. After all we've been through?
Not gonna happen!

1:17:56.160 --> 1:17:57.760
Argh!

1:18:01.200 --> 1:18:03.640
All right, mister,

1:18:03.680 --> 1:18:05.320
let's hear you talk.

1:18:05.360 --> 1:18:08.000
I'll give you one chance.
Unnn!

1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:08.280
I'll give you one chance.
Unnn!

1:18:09.880 --> 1:18:14.640
Desist from attacking my associate,
Morris.

1:18:14.680 --> 1:18:15.880
That's Mauriiiiice!

1:18:15.920 --> 1:18:16.000
Yes, sir! Mr Death!

1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:17.840
Yes, sir! Mr Death!

1:18:17.880 --> 1:18:19.680
Yes, at once, sir.

1:18:19.720 --> 1:18:21.040
Oof!

1:18:22.880 --> 1:18:24.000
Good to see you again, Morris.

1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:26.560
Good to see you again, Morris.

1:18:26.600 --> 1:18:29.400
Hello, sir. Good to see you again,
too.

1:18:29.440 --> 1:18:32.000
How many lives do you have left now?
Erm...

1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:33.160
How many lives do you have left now?
Erm...

1:18:33.200 --> 1:18:38.120
Lemme think. Er, six, sir! Six.
Very definitely six lives, sir.

1:18:38.160 --> 1:18:40.000
But you were run over by a cart
only last month, weren't you?

1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:42.440
But you were run over by a cart
only last month, weren't you?

1:18:42.480 --> 1:18:45.800
Oh, that, sir? No.
Buh-Barely grazed me.

1:18:45.840 --> 1:18:48.000
Got away with hardly a scratch, sir.
Exactly.

1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:49.120
Got away with hardly a scratch, sir.
Exactly.

1:18:49.160 --> 1:18:51.800
O-Oh. Oh, I... Yeah. I see.

1:18:51.840 --> 1:18:55.960
That makes five lives, Morris.

1:18:57.520 --> 1:19:00.080
Sir, please,

1:19:00.120 --> 1:19:01.920
take two of my lives.

1:19:01.960 --> 1:19:04.000
I would give an extra one
in exchange for the life

1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:04.320
I would give an extra one
in exchange for the life

1:19:04.360 --> 1:19:06.320
of this brave little rat.

1:19:06.360 --> 1:19:12.000
That is very un-cat-like of you,
Morris. I'm amazed.

1:19:12.040 --> 1:19:14.520
Well, I'm pretty shocked too, sir.

1:19:14.560 --> 1:19:18.080
It's just that this one is special.

1:19:18.120 --> 1:19:20.000
Wise and inspiring.

1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:21.920
Wise and inspiring.

1:19:21.960 --> 1:19:24.920
Your request will be granted.

1:19:24.960 --> 1:19:28.000
We came for two lives
and two we will take.

1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:28.880
We came for two lives
and two we will take.

1:19:28.920 --> 1:19:32.120
The balance is preserved.

1:19:32.160 --> 1:19:33.960
Thank you, sir!

1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:36.000
Oh, sir? I'm not gonna remember
all this, am I, sir?

1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:37.920
Oh, sir? I'm not gonna remember
all this, am I, sir?

1:19:37.960 --> 1:19:40.720
Because that would just be
too embarrassing.

1:19:40.760 --> 1:19:42.960
Of course not, Morris.

1:19:47.720 --> 1:19:50.160
Beans!

1:19:51.360 --> 1:19:52.000
Beans!

1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:52.800
Beans!

1:19:52.840 --> 1:19:56.080
Please say something!

1:19:57.080 --> 1:19:58.840
Beans?

1:19:58.880 --> 1:20:00.000
Don't leave me!

1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:01.720
Don't leave me!

1:20:01.760 --> 1:20:03.960
Beans...

1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:07.560
Dangerous Beans!

1:20:07.600 --> 1:20:08.000
I thought you were dead!

1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:09.760
I thought you were dead!

1:20:09.800 --> 1:20:12.400
I thought so, too!

1:20:16.560 --> 1:20:18.560
What?

1:20:23.880 --> 1:20:24.000
Hey!
Ah!

1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:26.040
Hey!
Ah!

1:20:27.240 --> 1:20:29.960
See, the couple of a story
has to kiss

1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:32.000
whenever there are people
celebrating around them.

1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:32.880
whenever there are people
celebrating around them.

1:20:32.920 --> 1:20:36.080
But this is real life?

1:20:36.120 --> 1:20:37.760
And a story.

1:20:37.800 --> 1:20:40.000
Our story.

1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:40.400
Our story.

1:20:41.440 --> 1:20:43.720
Well, in that case...

1:20:43.760 --> 1:20:45.240
Whoa!

1:20:45.280 --> 1:20:46.960
Mmmm!

1:20:49.360 --> 1:20:50.440
Mwah!

1:20:53.400 --> 1:20:54.920
Mm...

1:21:00.240 --> 1:21:04.000
Maurice, is that a purr?

1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:04.040
Maurice, is that a purr?

1:21:10.240 --> 1:21:12.000
"Ratty Rupert saved the day,
and Mr Bunnsy's hide!"

1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:15.240
"Ratty Rupert saved the day,
and Mr Bunnsy's hide!"

1:21:15.280 --> 1:21:17.680
"Well done, Ratty Rupert!"

1:21:17.720 --> 1:21:20.000
..cried the animals of Furry Bottom.

1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:21.760
..cried the animals of Furry Bottom.

1:21:24.360 --> 1:21:28.000
And that is how the story
of Mr Bunnsy ends.

1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:28.280
And that is how the story
of Mr Bunnsy ends.

1:21:28.320 --> 1:21:31.800
"But how does our story end?"
you might ask yourself.

1:21:31.840 --> 1:21:34.320
Well, in the end,

1:21:34.360 --> 1:21:36.000
our story is all about...

1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:37.680
our story is all about...

1:21:37.720 --> 1:21:39.600
# Rats!

1:21:39.640 --> 1:21:41.400
# You've... got...

1:21:41.440 --> 1:21:44.000
# ..rats! #

1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:44.840
# ..rats! #

1:21:44.880 --> 1:21:48.960
Bad Blintz has become
a tourist attraction!

1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:51.080
Ta-da!

1:21:52.120 --> 1:21:56.360
People travel from miles around
to visit.

1:21:59.720 --> 1:22:00.000
And buy the souvenir mugs
and stuffed toys

1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:02.320
And buy the souvenir mugs
and stuffed toys

1:22:02.360 --> 1:22:05.520
and other things which have no use
whatsoever,

1:22:05.560 --> 1:22:07.720
other than to be bought
and taken home.

1:22:07.760 --> 1:22:08.000
There you go, dear!
The famine is over

1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:11.400
There you go, dear!
The famine is over

1:22:11.440 --> 1:22:14.920
and there's plenty of food
for everyone!

1:22:14.960 --> 1:22:16.000
And once a day,
the town's Pied Piper,

1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:18.520
And once a day,
the town's Pied Piper,

1:22:18.560 --> 1:22:21.440
whose name is Keith and, actually,
who kisses rather well,

1:22:21.480 --> 1:22:23.400
plays his pipes,

1:22:23.440 --> 1:22:24.000
and the rats dance to the music
in a conga line.

1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:26.280
and the rats dance to the music
in a conga line.

1:22:26.320 --> 1:22:29.280
Ah, Mr Clicky, my lad.

1:22:29.320 --> 1:22:32.000
How's the family today?

1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:33.040
How's the family today?

1:22:33.080 --> 1:22:35.840
The rats have a town of their own

1:22:35.880 --> 1:22:38.640
and get free use of the library.

1:22:38.680 --> 1:22:40.000
And even send their little rats
to school.

1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:42.320
And even send their little rats
to school.

1:22:42.360 --> 1:22:45.520
In other words,
rodents live happily,

1:22:45.560 --> 1:22:48.000
side by side, with people.

1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:48.320
side by side, with people.

1:22:48.360 --> 1:22:53.880
Just how Peaches
once dreamed it would be.

1:22:53.920 --> 1:22:56.000
Due to the efforts of Maurice,
the Amazing Maurice,

1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:58.440
Due to the efforts of Maurice,
the Amazing Maurice,

1:22:58.480 --> 1:23:02.760
and his educated rodents!

1:23:04.240 --> 1:23:06.480
But mostly...

1:23:06.520 --> 1:23:08.000
..me!

1:23:08.040 --> 1:23:11.120
Meow!

1:23:20.480 --> 1:23:23.000
# Hey, what you doing?

1:23:23.040 --> 1:23:25.200
# I got a pocketful of rhythm
for you

1:23:25.240 --> 1:23:28.000
# And if you don't know
what it is you should do with it

1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:28.960
# And if you don't know
what it is you should do with it

1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:30.440
# Follow me

1:23:30.480 --> 1:23:32.720
# Follow me

1:23:32.760 --> 1:23:35.240
# Hey, where you going?

1:23:35.280 --> 1:23:36.000
# I see you looking for your light
but you're glowing

1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:38.320
# I see you looking for your light
but you're glowing

1:23:38.360 --> 1:23:40.720
# But if you take a look inside
then you'll know

1:23:40.760 --> 1:23:42.680
# It's gonna set you free

1:23:42.720 --> 1:23:44.000
# Set you free

1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:44.120
# Set you free

1:23:44.160 --> 1:23:47.680
# Oh, sometimes we get it right
# Ah, ah...

1:23:47.720 --> 1:23:50.600
# And we all get it wrong
# Ah, ah...

1:23:50.640 --> 1:23:52.000
# But you're always gonna fail

1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:53.720
# But you're always gonna fail

1:23:53.760 --> 1:23:57.840
# At being someone that you're not,
so...

1:23:57.880 --> 1:23:59.320
# Be yourself

1:23:59.360 --> 1:24:00.000
# Cos everybody else

1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:00.840
# Cos everybody else

1:24:00.880 --> 1:24:02.520
# Is taking

1:24:02.560 --> 1:24:04.040
# And everybody else

1:24:04.080 --> 1:24:06.960
# Is faking it till they're making it

1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:08.000
# Be yourself

1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:09.080
# Be yourself

1:24:10.080 --> 1:24:11.680
# Be yourself

1:24:11.720 --> 1:24:13.160
# Cos everybody else

1:24:13.200 --> 1:24:14.840
# Is taking

1:24:14.880 --> 1:24:16.000
# And everybody else

1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:16.200
# And everybody else

1:24:16.240 --> 1:24:19.240
# Is faking it till they're making it

1:24:19.280 --> 1:24:23.200
# Be yourself-elf-elf-elf!

1:24:27.360 --> 1:24:29.920
# Hey, it's been too long

1:24:29.960 --> 1:24:32.000
# And you've been sticking out
in places you don't belong

1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:33.080
# And you've been sticking out
in places you don't belong

1:24:33.120 --> 1:24:35.720
# But when you find the melody
of your own song

1:24:35.760 --> 1:24:37.360
# Well, sing along

1:24:37.400 --> 1:24:38.840
# Sing along

1:24:38.880 --> 1:24:40.000
# Oh, sometimes we get it right
# Ah, ah...
