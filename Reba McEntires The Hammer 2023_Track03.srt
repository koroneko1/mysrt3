Yeah, well get used to it, okay?
    Clean that up, would you?

155
00:07:59,295 --> 00:08:00,870
All right.

156
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:02,063
Kim:
            All rise.

157
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:06,735
Fifth district court state
    of nevada now in session.

158
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:13,909
Honorable judge kim wheeler
      presiding. That's me.

159
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:18,955
That's the judge. [laughs]

160
00:08:22,485 --> 00:08:24,728
Full house, I see.

161
00:08:24,746 --> 00:08:26,171
Okay, everybody sit down.

162
00:08:28,825 --> 00:08:32,844
First up on the docket is,
    uh, mr. Langdon marshall.

163
00:08:33,922 --> 00:08:35,013
Langdon's lawyer:
           That's you.

164
00:08:35,164 --> 00:08:37,849
Mr. Marshall, I understand
        you were arrested

165
00:08:38,076 --> 00:08:41,669
For public intoxication
 and indecency, is that correct?

166
00:08:41,763 --> 00:08:44,523
Indecency! [laughs]

167
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,340
Keep it down
     or it's back to lockup.

168
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,193
[laughs] yeah.

169
00:08:50,605 --> 00:08:52,272
Tell me what happened,
          mr. Marshall.

170
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:53,773
We was hanging out at dusty's.

171
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,258
There was a line at the john,

172
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:57,869
So I went outside
       to do my business.

173
00:08:58,096 --> 00:09:01,188
Next thing I know,
 this cop throws a light on me.

174
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:04,284
I, I turn around and...
   And everybody saw my junk.

175
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:05,602
[willis laughs]

176
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,713
Mr. Marshall,
   you've been arrested twice,

177
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,718
Once for public intoxication,
   once for public urination,

178
00:09:13,945 --> 00:09:16,446
And once for trespassing
   while trying to steal beer

179
00:09:16,464 --> 00:09:18,281
From a neighbor's garage.

180
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,374
You got a problem with alcohol?

181
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,635
Problem with alcohol?
          Who doesn't?

182
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,211
-Kim: Okay.
            -Woohoo!

183
00:09:24,306 --> 00:09:26,398
Hey, when I'm speaking,
           you zip it.

184
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:28,958
Otherwise, we're gonna
     have a problem, mister.

185
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:33,054
Oh, you want a problem, woman?
    I got a problem with you.

186
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,990
-Yes, I do.
  -Lawyer: Wait, wait, bailiff!

187
00:09:36,318 --> 00:09:37,801
You're the problem, yeah!

[kim sighs]

193
00:09:54,744 --> 00:09:57,078
I'm sweating like
       a whore in church.

194
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,504
Of course, that could have
         something to do

195
00:09:58,657 --> 00:10:00,081
With me getting attacked.

196
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,492
It's my fault, your honor.
 I should not have left my post.

197
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:04,828
-Oh, I asked you to.
         -Vicky: Still.

198
00:10:04,846 --> 00:10:06,179
Don't beat yourself up.

199
00:10:06,331 --> 00:10:08,181
Clearly,
   I can take care of myself.

200
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,941
Judge, we have a problem.

201
00:10:10,168 --> 00:10:10,942
What's that?

202
00:10:11,169 --> 00:10:12,259
Tomorrow is the, uh,

203
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:15,096
Hearing for the dirk crawford
          murder case.

204
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,448
Dirk crawford?

205
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:19,100
Ran his best friend off
   the road for dating his ex.

206
00:10:19,194 --> 00:10:20,434
Still doesn't ring a bell.

207
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:23,346
That's because it was left off
        of your schedule.

208
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:25,606
Technically, my mistake,
    but the judge's assistant

209
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,368
Usually double checks
          these things.

210
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:31,855
Bottom line, you're due
in tonopah tomorrow at 8:00 a.M.

211
00:10:31,948 --> 00:10:33,280
Tonopah? Well,
      that's quite a trek.

212
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,375
A hundred-and-sixty-seven miles.

213
00:10:35,527 --> 00:10:36,450
We'll leave after work,

214
00:10:36,544 --> 00:10:38,136
Stay the night
      at the mitzvah hotel.

215
00:10:38,287 --> 00:10:39,787
The courthouse
       is right next door.

216
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,197
Can't we postpone?

217
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,308
It's a motion to dismiss
  for a lack of a speedy trial,

218
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:46,219
So I don't think that
        would be prudent.

219
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:49,064
The passing of judge brewer
has been difficult on all sides.

You will know the lord

When he gives you meat
     in the evening, exodus.

226
00:11:09,744 --> 00:11:13,079
Okay, I got venison, sausage,
  eggs, and buttered sourdough.

227
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,340
You know there's 41 carbs
 in that single slice of bread.

Ooh, carb smart.

You're gonna need your energy

Here's you a fork.

[chuckles] this is quite
        the rig you got.

Well, thank you.
       Had it custom made.

233

Twin-turbo v8, chipped
      with a custom camper.

No, not smiling. Not smiling.

Although you have to admit,

A hammer's a pretty good

If I witness a crime

Oh, my kind of place.

304
00:15:04,812 --> 00:15:06,220
What do you say we
      get a drink later on?

305
00:15:06,314 --> 00:15:08,722
-Yeah.
    -[electricity crackling]

306
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,891
Hmm, hope you're okay
          with ghosts.

307
00:15:10,985 --> 00:15:12,985
Oh, dead doesn't bother me.

308
00:15:13,138 --> 00:15:14,728
It's the living
    that gives me the creeps.

309
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:15,896
Vicky:
               Mm.

310
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,141
[gentle upbeat music continues]

311
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:20,309
[hands tapping]

312
00:15:21,146 --> 00:15:22,995
Evening, ma'am.
       What's your poison?

313
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,997
-Well, hi there...
             -Vance.

314
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,408
Vance, uh, well,
   I prefer an old fashioned,

315
00:15:27,502 --> 00:15:29,986
But I'll settle on a diet soda.

316
00:15:30,004 --> 00:15:32,079
-Coming right up.
           -Thank you.

317
00:15:32,915 --> 00:15:34,581
Customer:
  Hey, vance, you got my order?

318
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,677
Sure do.
   There's your bottle, buddy.

319
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:39,345
Customer:
             Thanks.

320
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,164
You sell booze to go?

321
00:15:41,182 --> 00:15:43,332
I didn't realize
   that was still being done.

322
00:15:43,351 --> 00:15:45,276
Yes, ma'am.
  Whatever the customer wants.

323
00:15:46,354 --> 00:15:48,020
Can I ask what brings you
    to our neck of the woods.

324
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,856
Uh, court. I'm the new judge.

325
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:53,693
The hammer, right?
        Congratulations.

326
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:54,935
First time in tonopah?

327
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:58,289
No, I grew up around here.
         How about you?

328
00:15:58,441 --> 00:15:59,440
Born and raised.

329
00:15:59,534 --> 00:16:02,443
Mm. Married, got any family?

330
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:06,372
Eh, there's a special lady,
      but it's complicated.

331
00:16:06,524 --> 00:16:08,257
Yeah, can relate to that.

332
00:16:09,618 --> 00:16:11,785
-Love what you did to the place.
        -Bart: Thank you.

333
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:16,365
[upbeat lively music]

334
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:17,624
How about a little splash
           of whiskey

335
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:19,202
In that drink, your honor?

336
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,463
Not opposed, but I do like
 to know who I'm drinking with.

337
00:16:22,557 --> 00:16:24,131
I'm the owner
     of this establishment,

338
00:16:24,225 --> 00:16:26,042
-Bart crawford.
             -Ah-ha.

339
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,969
Well, I'm the judge
       in your son's case,

340
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:31,489
And any conversation
      outside the courtroom

341
00:16:31,716 --> 00:16:34,659
Would be construed
   as a conflict of interest.

342
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,220
Only interest I have is
 in getting to know you better.

343
00:16:37,238 --> 00:16:38,663
Well, well, if you've got
        something to say,

344
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:39,889
Go ahead and say it

345
00:16:39,907 --> 00:16:42,058
'cause I'm fixing
      to enjoy my evening.

346
00:16:42,076 --> 00:16:43,576
Just wanna say welcome.

347
00:16:43,728 --> 00:16:45,652
We residents of tonopah
      are thrilled to have

348
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,397
A legal mind of your caliber
          on the bench.

349
00:16:48,491 --> 00:16:50,066
I hope you don't
      mind me saying this,

350
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:52,401
But you remind me
  of that serpent in the bible.

351
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,661
-Really?
            -Uh-huh.

352
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,740
Well, historically,
     the serpent's a symbol

353
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,260
Of fertility and renewal
       of the life force.

354
00:17:01,412 --> 00:17:02,836
Not very subtle, are you?

355
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,172
-May I?
         -Help yourself.

356
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,858
The governor's
        a friend of mine.

357
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:09,009
When he mentioned your name
    to replace judge brewer,

358
00:17:09,103 --> 00:17:12,012
I endorsed your wholeheartedly.

359
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,515
As a lawyer, no one in this
  state's done more for victims

360
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,609
Of abuse and discrimination
         than you have.

361
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:18,185
Well, thank you for that.

362
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,204
So, you're a friend
      of the governor, huh?

363
00:17:20,431 --> 00:17:22,874
Bart:
  I am, we, we met in princeton

364
00:17:23,101 --> 00:17:25,451
For my two decades
       in silicon valley.

365
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,436
So you're a techie. [chuckles]

366
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,363
I bet this place
       bores you to tears.

367
00:17:29,457 --> 00:17:30,773
Well, no. On the contrary,

368
00:17:30,866 --> 00:17:33,276
Nevada's a land
     of untapped potential.

369
00:17:33,369 --> 00:17:35,611
I'm very excited
        about being back.

370
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,447
Your honor. Bart.

371
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:42,134
[grunts] you ladies going
    out on the town tonight?

372
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,803
I could arrange a special table.

373
00:17:43,955 --> 00:17:46,064
Thanks, but we're good.

374
00:17:47,642 --> 00:17:49,383
You two enjoy your evening.

375
00:17:49,477 --> 00:17:51,736
Judge wheeler,
     very nice to meet you.

376
00:17:52,888 --> 00:17:54,072
Mr. Crawford.

377
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,632
Bart:
            Victoria.

378
00:17:56,725 --> 00:18:01,153
[laughs] I didn't take you
       for a saloon girl.

379
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,472
Hey, I was just sitting
  here minding my own business.

380
00:18:03,491 --> 00:18:04,415
Sure, but if I was you,

381
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:06,492
I'd stay away
       from bart crawford.

382
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,920
He's always reminded me
   of that snake in the bible.

383
00:18:10,648 --> 00:18:11,497
Vance.

384
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:14,092
[gentle upbeat music]

385
00:18:14,243 --> 00:18:18,846

[cellphone ringing]

387
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,192
Vicky:
               Mm.

388
00:18:34,005 --> 00:18:34,737
Mm.

389
00:18:37,692 --> 00:18:40,693
[clears throat]
      this better be good.

390
00:18:40,845 --> 00:18:43,679
Friend:
        Hey honey, it is.

391
00:18:43,698 --> 00:18:46,273
The autopsy just came
      back on judge brewer.

392
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:48,042
It looks like he was
            murdered.

393
00:18:49,354 --> 00:18:50,536
Yeah. Okay, thanks.

394
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,356
[dramatic tense music]

395
00:18:53,374 --> 00:18:57,802
[♪♪]

396
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:11,399
Judge wheeler. Judge wheeler!

397
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:17,046
What are you,
    some kind of new rooster?

398
00:19:17,064 --> 00:19:18,805
I thought I saw someone
         sneaking about.

399
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:21,233
Maybe it's the mitzvah ghost.

400
00:19:21,386 --> 00:19:22,809
And you said you'd sleep
       in a room tonight.

401
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,163
I tried, but it was so stuffy.

402
00:19:26,224 --> 00:19:27,740
What are you doing
        down here anyway?

403
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,558
Vicky:
    I just got off the phone
         with a friend.

404
00:19:29,577 --> 00:19:31,335
The autopsy for judge brewer
         just came back.

405
00:19:31,487 --> 00:19:32,578
He was murdered.

406
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:36,174
[dramatic tense music]

407
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,328
[gentle upbeat music]

408
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,330
-Kim: Good morning.
      -Vicky: Good morning.

409
00:19:43,424 --> 00:19:46,075
-All clean. Wanna check?
          -I trust you.

410
00:19:46,093 --> 00:19:49,020
Okay, so how close
       is the courthouse?

411
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:51,147
-Eh, I'd say it's pretty close.
            -Mm-hmm.

412
00:19:53,342 --> 00:19:56,027
Judge, I have to say
         I'm concerned.

413
00:19:56,254 --> 00:19:57,586
What about?

414
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,679
Well, we just learned
          that the man

415
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,031
That you replaced was killed,

416
00:20:00,182 --> 00:20:02,700
And then there was a stranger
    in white snakeskin boots

417
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:05,536
Creeping around your truck
           last night.

418
00:20:05,763 --> 00:20:07,521
How are you completely
      unfazed by all this?

419
00:20:07,615 --> 00:20:09,356
You're not worried
       you could be next?

420
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,877
Oh, it's just the way I am,
    calm under the pressure.

421
00:20:13,104 --> 00:20:16,380
So, any more information
     back from your friend?

422
00:20:16,532 --> 00:20:18,716
They have a suspect,
but that's all he could tell me.

423
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:21,444
Is he a boyfriend?

424
00:20:21,537 --> 00:20:23,870
Oh, we went on a date or two.

425
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,465
-Is he in law enforcement?
         -He's a deputy.

426
00:20:26,617 --> 00:20:28,375
Any more questions
     in this interrogation?

427
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,544
No, not right now, but I'm sure
    I'll think of something.

428
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,480
[both chuckling]

429
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,358
[people chattering indistinctly]

430
00:20:37,812 --> 00:20:39,144
You're right. It is close.

431
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,963
[chuckles] you ready?

432
00:20:40,982 --> 00:20:41,864
Mm-hmm.

433
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,909
Vicky:
            All rise.

434
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,487
Fifth district court
     of the state of nevada

435
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,655
Is now in session.

436
00:20:49,807 --> 00:20:52,250
The honorable kim wheeler
         now presiding.

437
00:20:53,661 --> 00:20:55,086
Y'all sit down.

438
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:02,242
All right, we've gathered today

439
00:21:02,336 --> 00:21:04,653
To hear a motion
     to dismiss in the case

440
00:21:04,672 --> 00:21:08,432
Of the people v. Dirk crawford
    on the charge of murder.

441
00:21:08,584 --> 00:21:09,842
Okay, I've read the brief.

442
00:21:09,994 --> 00:21:12,995
Any additional information
     for me, mr. Goodlander?

443
00:21:13,014 --> 00:21:14,605
Your honor,
   the late judge brewer acted

444
00:21:14,757 --> 00:21:17,166
With bias towards mr. Crawford
       by denying him bail

445
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:19,001
And leaving him incarcerated
     these past eight months

446
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,504
Despite the fact
    he poses no flight risk.

447
00:21:21,597 --> 00:21:23,597
Dirk crawford,
    the son of bart crawford,

448
00:21:23,691 --> 00:21:25,265
The one that owns
      the large solar farm

449
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:26,767
-Along the highway?
        -Yes, your honor,

450
00:21:26,861 --> 00:21:28,101
But I don't see
      how that's relevant.

451
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,679
Well, he possesses the means
       to evade judgment.

452
00:21:30,698 --> 00:21:32,364
I'm gonna side
   with judge brewer on this.

453
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,682
What else you got?

454
00:21:33,701 --> 00:21:36,185
Judge wheeler,
   the actions of judge brewer

455
00:21:36,203 --> 00:21:37,962
Denied my client his right
       to a speedy trial,

456
00:21:38,113 --> 00:21:39,188
And every day that goes by

457
00:21:39,206 --> 00:21:41,114
Further prejudices
      mr. Crawford's case.

458
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,949
-In what way?
   -My client's defense hinges

459
00:21:43,044 --> 00:21:44,693
On the testimony
        of eyewitnesses.

460
00:21:44,787 --> 00:21:46,378
Their ability to recall
     the events in question

461
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:49,640
Could be negatively affected
     by the passage of time.

462
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:52,551
You're afraid that a bunch
     of small-town teenagers

00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,036
Won't remember the night

That one of their own
           was killed?

-Your honor, may I approach?
       -Yeah, come on up.

You better start
     acting remorseful, son,

467
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:04,971
And I mean right now.

468
00:22:05,066 --> 00:22:06,065
With all due respect, judge,

469
00:22:06,217 --> 00:22:07,474
You may not be aware
          of the depth

470
00:22:07,568 --> 00:22:09,976
Of animosity that exists
  between the late judge brewer

471
00:22:10,071 --> 00:22:11,403
And the senior mr. Crawford.

472
00:22:11,556 --> 00:22:13,814
Your honor, this is all
  clearly a calculated attempt

473
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,816
To introduce the idea
  that the witnesses scheduled

474
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:18,060
To testify can't be trusted

475
00:22:18,153 --> 00:22:19,912
To remember events
        as they occurred.

All righty then.
   Looks like I'm free Monday.

Oh, pretty.

Oh, I was meaning to ask you,
     the young man who died,

493
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:10,388
Was any of his family
     in the courtroom today?

No. He only has an uncle
    that lives in a va home.

Wow, well how about the blond

What's her story?

00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:21,957
Probably exactly
         what you think.

Rumor is she broke
   a lot of hearts around here

Trying to make bart jealous,
   but he still divorced her.

Well, why was she giving me
          the evil eye?

505
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:33,327
Probably 'cause she thought
  you'd dismiss her son's case.

Hmm, you know anything

Between bart crawford

No details, just

To kill the judge

In reconsidering
        your appointment.

You're a topnotch lawyer, kim.

More lucrative avenues
     you'd like to explore.

576
00:26:09,476 --> 00:26:11,627
Again, with all due respect,

577
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,571
I think
   you're underestimating me.

00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:16,298
So, if there's nothing else
  you need to discuss with me,

I'll let you get on
        with your dinner.

Well, in that case,
    there is one more thing.

Yes, sir.

Well, I'm turning
         it over to you.

588
00:26:36,987 --> 00:26:38,170
Really?

589
00:26:38,322 --> 00:26:40,764
I mean, that's work best
   suited for a woman anyway.

590
00:26:40,916 --> 00:26:43,842
I mean, you know, a lot
  of hand holding and scolding.

Right. Okay,
     so contextualize away.

Well, the judge and I
had an adversarial relationship.

820
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:19,629
He was strongly opposed
     to my, uh, solar farm,

821
00:38:19,781 --> 00:38:21,781
Which he claimed
    was bad for biodiversity.

00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:26,118
When I prevailed in court...
          He was livid.

823
00:38:26,212 --> 00:38:29,213
And then your son got arrested,
and he was assigned to the case.

824
00:38:29,308 --> 00:38:31,716
He refused to consider a plea,

825
00:38:31,868 --> 00:38:33,535
And when he locked up dirk
          without bail,

826
00:38:33,628 --> 00:38:39,040
We got into a, uh...
        Heated argument.

-So, you have a temper?

My son, unfortunately,
       has the same issue.

830

So, why are you telling me
          all of this?

831
00:38:52,146 --> 00:38:53,312
Well, a couple of reasons.

832
00:38:53,406 --> 00:38:55,740
I know my son comes off
    as an entitled teenager,

833
00:38:55,892 --> 00:38:57,408
But that's just an act.

834
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,410
Truth is he's scared to death.

835
00:38:59,563 --> 00:39:00,562
His best friend's dead,

836
00:39:00,655 --> 00:39:02,914
And he hasn't come
        to terms with it.

837
00:39:03,066 --> 00:39:05,249
But he will, I promise.

838
00:39:05,402 --> 00:39:08,178
-And the second reason?
     -I didn't want you, uh,

00:39:08,405 --> 00:39:10,496
Going around thinking
     I might be a murderer.

   to take your word for that.

No, no.

      of security cameras.

00:42:09,176 --> 00:42:13,104
At the jail reminded me
    of me when I was her age.

893
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:14,756
Back then, all I wanted to do

894
00:42:14,774 --> 00:42:17,116
Is have this town
     in my rear view mirror.

895
00:42:18,111 --> 00:42:19,277
Kris:
         It's all right.

896
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:21,929
And I guess that's what I did.

897
00:42:21,948 --> 00:42:24,707
Kris, I'm sorry
   I ran out on you last time.

898
00:42:26,436 --> 00:42:28,378
Least I could have done
      was to leave a note.

899
00:42:28,529 --> 00:42:29,862
You hated it here.

900
00:42:29,956 --> 00:42:32,456
No, I hated the situation.
   I didn't hate the location.

901
00:42:32,609 --> 00:42:37,536
Maybe so, but...
   I left you alone with him.

902
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,297
I shouldn't have done that.

903
00:42:39,449 --> 00:42:41,132
It's my fault you left.

904
00:42:41,284 --> 00:42:43,375
I don't know
      what I was thinking.

905
00:42:43,469 --> 00:42:45,144
Yeah, I was really mad at that.

906
00:42:46,714 --> 00:42:49,048
But I'm not mad anymore.
            All gone.

907
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:50,716
Kris:
    Well, hallelujah to that.

908
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:52,143
[both laughs]

909

  -Kris: Wait'll you meet him.

What now, wayne?

       missing a husband?

-How do, deputy?
             -Judge.

916
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:15,425
Oh, wayne, you know my sister?

917
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:21,656
We've, uh, met, and, uh,
   I'm sorry about this, kris.

918
00:43:21,749 --> 00:43:23,933
[sighs]
   I'm just following orders.

919
00:43:26,605 --> 00:43:28,162
Kris wheeler, you
        are under arrest

920
00:43:28,181 --> 00:43:30,089
For the murder
     of judge jacob brewer.

921
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,165
Okay, come on, wa--
    you gotta be kidding me.

922
00:43:31,184 --> 00:43:33,017
You have the right
        to remain silent.

923
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,594
Anything you say may be used
 against you in a court of law.

924
00:43:35,614 --> 00:43:36,779
You have the right
     to consult an attorney.

925
00:43:36,931 --> 00:43:38,931
-Let me see that.
  -Yes, ma'am. It's all there.

Sorry, kris. It's legit.

928
00:43:43,104 --> 00:43:45,012
Okay, all right,
       this is ridiculous.

929
00:43:45,031 --> 00:43:46,848
I didn't do it.

930

Kimmie. Kimmie,
      you gotta believe me.

-Don't talk to anyone.
        -Okay, I got it.

932
00:43:50,186 --> 00:43:51,853
I'll come see you
        as soon as I can.

Oh, save me
  the crappy metaphors, ellis.

942

You haul my sister off to jail

943
00:44:25,071 --> 00:44:26,904
And you don't even bother
           to call me?

944
00:44:27,056 --> 00:44:29,740
Sorry, we had to move fast.

945
00:44:29,893 --> 00:44:31,501
You even got a case, ellis?

946
00:44:31,728 --> 00:44:33,060
Perhaps you could stop by
         my office later

947
00:44:33,154 --> 00:44:35,320
-To discuss the matter.
            -Oh, no.

948
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,156
We're gonna talk about it
           right now.

949

-[clears throat]

950
00:44:40,995 --> 00:44:42,845
Okay, as you know,

951
00:44:43,072 --> 00:44:45,423
Judge brewer
      died of heart attack,

952
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:48,167
But there was tissue damage
     suggesting drug abuse,

953
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,835
So a toxicology report
          was ordered.

954
00:44:49,929 --> 00:44:51,579
Now the report
     found a massive amount

955
00:44:51,672 --> 00:44:53,356
Of oxycontin in his system.

956
00:44:53,507 --> 00:44:55,340
And that ties
        to my sister how?

957
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,859
Well, she was the last one
        to see him alive,

958
00:44:57,086 --> 00:44:58,510
And oxy was found
        in her possession

959
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:00,087
During a recent investigation,

960
00:45:00,106 --> 00:45:02,423
So we believe
 ms. Wheeler provided the drugs

961
00:45:02,442 --> 00:45:04,425
-That led to the judge's demise.
             -Drugs.

962
00:45:04,444 --> 00:45:06,369
You mean
    there was more than one?

963
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,687
Rohypnol was also found
          in the blood.

964
00:45:08,707 --> 00:45:10,522
Well, that doesn't make
           any sense.

965
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:12,783
Who parties on a date rape drug?

966
00:45:12,936 --> 00:45:15,027
Who knows
     why people do anything?

967
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:17,029
I want a copy
      of that m.E. Report.

968
00:45:17,123 --> 00:45:19,698
Your honor, you have to get
   discovery through council.

969
00:45:19,792 --> 00:45:21,108
Now, if you'll excuse me,

970

  and I must get back to work.

      for her arraignment.

976
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,028
I can't see her till tomorrow.

977

Oh, well, I thought
      you would wanna know

978
00:45:44,317 --> 00:45:45,816
I heard from malcolm
         in carson city.

979
00:45:45,969 --> 00:45:46,968
And?

980
00:45:47,061 --> 00:45:48,727
He said he can't divulge
          the contents

981
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:50,471
Of leo stevenson's
         sealed records,

982
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:53,065
But he suggested
    I look into the registry

983
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:56,477
Of spring hill in 2008.

984
00:45:56,496 --> 00:45:58,755
It sounded like
    leo was a patient there.

985
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:02,333
-You know spring hill?
             -I do.

986

Mm-hmm.

989

Were you aware
       that leo stevenson

990
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:13,919
Was in the bathroom watching
  the girls give their samples,

991
00:46:14,013 --> 00:46:16,421
Then threatening to fail them
 if they don't go out with him?

992
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:17,665
No, I was not.

993
00:46:17,758 --> 00:46:19,275
Are you telling me
      there's no oversight

994
00:46:19,502 --> 00:46:21,002
In this drug testing
          program here?

Hey, I've only been
 on drug court a couple of days,

Same as you.

997
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:26,690
And you really think I'd cover
     for that little weasel?

00:46:26,843 --> 00:46:29,109
No, of course not. Okay.

So, what about leo?
    Can we have him arrested?

Not unless someone comes forward
    with some real evidence.

There is one person,
   but she doesn't wanna talk.

Yeah, look, I know these girls.

1003

They're alone and afraid
        and all they want

1004
00:46:49,382 --> 00:46:51,365
Is to know that somebody
         has their back.

Let me just give you
  a little personal experience.

1015

If you stay quiet
 and bury this deep down inside

And just go on with your life,

            -Mm-hmm.

1039
00:48:39,992 --> 00:48:41,918
Let's start out with you
 telling me everything you know

1040
00:48:42,145 --> 00:48:43,753
About the night
     that judge brewer died.

1041
00:48:44,571 --> 00:48:48,090
Okay, um, well he, uh,

1042
00:48:48,242 --> 00:48:50,927
He showed up around nine,
      you know, usual time.

1043
00:48:51,154 --> 00:48:52,486
-So, he was a regular.
           -Oh, yeah.

1044
00:48:52,579 --> 00:48:54,079
He shoulda had a punch card.

1045
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:55,932
Whenever he had court
           in tonopah,

1046
00:48:56,159 --> 00:48:58,509
He'd tell his wife
 he was staying at the mitzvah.

1047
00:48:58,603 --> 00:49:01,328
He'd make a big show about
 having a few drinks at the bar,

1048
00:49:01,347 --> 00:49:04,607
And then he'd drive down
to the lady and spend the night.

1049
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:07,592
Mm-hmm. So, what happened
       when he showed up?

1050
00:49:07,687 --> 00:49:09,928
Oh, he must have been drunk.

1051
00:49:10,022 --> 00:49:12,856
Sadie went in to wake him up,
     but he was passed out.

1052
00:49:13,009 --> 00:49:14,099
And he was dead
        the next morning.

1053
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:15,009
Yeah.

1054
00:49:15,027 --> 00:49:16,452
You ever give him any drugs?

1055
00:49:16,603 --> 00:49:21,365
Kim, we don't provide drugs
   at the lady. We're ladies.

1056
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:24,368
If a guest brings their own,
         that's on them.

1057
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,204
Okay, so where did the oxy
 come from that the cops found?

1058
00:49:27,356 --> 00:49:28,522
Dad's prescription.

1059
00:49:28,615 --> 00:49:30,541
-Oh.
       -For his dementia.

1060
00:49:30,693 --> 00:49:34,136
I keep the bottle in my bag
 so he doesn't accidentally od.

1061
00:49:35,289 --> 00:49:37,047
Did judge brewer's
         wife ever know

1062
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:39,475
That he was catting around
     down at the shady lady?

1063
00:49:39,626 --> 00:49:43,554
Uh, no.
    Woman's holier than thou.

1064
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:45,464
Judge told me once if she knew

1065
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:48,633
What he was doing,
         she'd kill him.

Now, I could throw you in jail

00:55:56,854 --> 00:56:01,415
Ms. Brown, I'm gonna throw out
      your last drug test.

1185
00:56:01,433 --> 00:56:04,434
You'll submit a new test
   overseen by bailiff mason.

1186
00:56:04,587 --> 00:56:05,936
If the results are negative,

1187
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:08,105
You'll retain your position
         in drug court.

1188
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:09,681
Thank you, your honor.

1189
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,866
I'm just sorry
      I didn't believe you

1190
00:56:11,017 --> 00:56:12,109
In the first place.

1191
00:56:12,686 --> 00:56:14,444
-Court adjourned.

Miss price, can I see you
         in my chambers?

1194
00:56:19,952 --> 00:56:21,168
[camera shutter clicking]

1195
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:27,532
You wanted to see me,
           your honor?

1196
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:30,386
Yes I did, young lady.
        Come right on in.

1197
00:56:34,617 --> 00:56:36,225
What you did out there
           took guts.

1198
00:56:36,376 --> 00:56:38,042
I'm really proud of you.

1199
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:40,971
From what I can tell,
      you're tough, smart,

1200
00:56:41,123 --> 00:56:43,047
Hardworking, and well organized.

1201
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:44,566
How'd you like
      to come work for me?

1202
00:56:44,718 --> 00:56:46,960
I need an assistant.

1203
00:56:46,979 --> 00:56:49,071
Uh, um...

1204
00:56:49,222 --> 00:56:53,075
Course, you'd have to quit
  the classy cat. Pay's decent.

1205
00:56:53,302 --> 00:56:56,227
But the best part of all is
  you'd be able to have dinner

1206
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:57,704
With your daughter every night.

1207
00:56:59,141 --> 00:57:02,492
I... I don't know what to say.

1208
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:04,002
Say yes.

1209
00:57:05,071 --> 00:57:07,664
-Yes.
            -[laughs]

1210

Thank you, your honor.

1211
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,168
Call me kim,
     and your office will be

1212
00:57:11,262 --> 00:57:13,077
Right around the corner there.

1213
00:57:13,172 --> 00:57:14,763
First order of business,
        I'd like for you

1214
00:57:14,915 --> 00:57:17,415
To call judge brewer's wife
     and ask her to come by

1215
00:57:17,435 --> 00:57:19,435
And pick up some
    of her husband's things.

1216
00:57:20,754 --> 00:57:23,272
Yes, your honor. Kim.

1217
00:57:23,423 --> 00:57:26,500
There you go. [laughing]

-This came for you.
           -Who from?

   There's no return address.

1220

Oh, well let's see.

-You know this cat?
        -Kim: Yes, I do.

00:57:47,523 --> 00:57:49,298
Home is where the heart is.

Dad. Oh, my god, dad.

We can't find daisy.

[gentle melancholy music]

1237

Wait, someone killed
         your dad's cat?

1238
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:41,183
That's serious.

1239
00:58:41,334 --> 00:58:42,518
Yeah, I think
  they were trying to scare me,

1240
00:58:42,745 --> 00:58:45,929
-Throw me off my game.
   -Yeah, but for what reason?

1241
00:58:46,081 --> 00:58:48,098
Well, maybe they don't want me
           to find out

1242
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:50,025
Who really killed judge brewer.

1243
00:58:50,176 --> 00:58:51,768
Okay, and if you're wrong,

1244
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:53,529
I mean, you're putting
      your family at risk.

1245
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,772
Okay, I was hoping that
  you would talk to your friend

1246
00:58:55,924 --> 00:58:57,533
At the sheriff's department
           and ask him

1247
00:58:57,684 --> 00:58:59,926
If he wouldn't mind keeping
   an eye on my daddy's ranch.

1248
00:58:59,945 --> 00:59:01,019
Of course.

1249
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:03,613
I don't want word
      getting back to kris.

1250
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:06,099
She's got enough to worry about.

1251
00:59:06,118 --> 00:59:08,210
Vicky:
      Judge brewer's wife's
          been waiting.

1252
00:59:10,363 --> 00:59:14,132
Right, I'll go talk with her.
        Is that his junk?

1253
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:15,884
Yeah.

1254
00:59:17,037 --> 00:59:20,447
[indistinct chatter]

-Wish me luck.
     -You're gonna need it.

1256
00:59:22,968 --> 00:59:24,059
Thanks.

1257
00:59:27,547 --> 00:59:30,640
-Ms. Brewer?
              -Yes.

1258
00:59:30,793 --> 00:59:32,734
I'm kim wheeler,
         the new judge.

1259
00:59:33,796 --> 00:59:35,128
Oh.

1260
00:59:35,147 --> 00:59:38,222
I understand your husband
   was a kind man, well-liked.

1261
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:42,135
[scoffs] for some.
        These his things?

1262
00:59:42,154 --> 00:59:44,729
Yes, forgive me for being
     indelicate, ms. Brewer,

1263
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:46,564
But were you aware
        that your husband

1264
00:59:46,584 --> 00:59:48,250
Liked to visit the shady lady?

1265
00:59:49,494 --> 00:59:51,144
With your tramp sister?

1266
00:59:51,237 --> 00:59:53,237
I know kris didn't lead
         a sacred life,

1267
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:54,923
But she's no killer, ms. Brewer.

1268
00:59:55,150 --> 00:59:56,499
There's no telling
      what a piece of trash

1269
00:59:56,652 --> 00:59:57,834
Like that is capable of.

1270
00:59:57,986 --> 01:00:00,320
I know my sister and she swears

1271
01:00:00,339 --> 01:00:02,322
She did not give your husband
           any drugs.

1272
01:00:02,341 --> 01:00:05,325
Oh, she would do anything
       to destroy our love

1273
01:00:05,344 --> 01:00:07,728
-And ruin our marriage.
    -What makes you say that?

1274
01:00:09,422 --> 01:00:13,775
Two years ago, I found out
   jacob was having an affair.

1275
01:00:14,002 --> 01:00:15,852
He confessed
   and was granted forgiveness

1276
01:00:16,004 --> 01:00:18,530
By the good lord and myself.

1277
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,174
Two weeks ago,

1278
01:00:21,193 --> 01:00:23,285
I found this letter
      in his jacket pocket.

1279
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:28,606
An unsigned love letter?

1280
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:32,369
From your sister
     begging him to return,

1281
01:00:32,521 --> 01:00:35,422
And when he didn't,
     she killed him, mm-hmm.

1282
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:37,549
And there's the proof.

1283
01:00:39,303 --> 01:00:41,470
Have you shown this
         to the sheriff?

1284
01:00:41,697 --> 01:00:43,096
I, I meant to, uh...

1285
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:47,309
Some reason
  I just couldn't part with it.

1286
01:00:48,871 --> 01:00:52,463
Maybe because both of us know
  my sister didn't write this.

1287
01:00:52,483 --> 01:00:53,899
I'll make sure
      the sheriff gets it.

1288
01:00:55,227 --> 01:01:00,280
I'm sorry for your loss.
      Thanks for coming by.

1289
01:01:04,052 --> 01:01:07,737
[tense suspenseful music]

1290
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:09,414
How did you know it was me?

1291
01:01:11,076 --> 01:01:12,167
Your handwriting.

1292
01:01:12,394 --> 01:01:14,895
I'd recognize
   that fancy script anywhere.

1293
01:01:16,064 --> 01:01:19,249
I wrote that letter
   after jacob and I broke up.

1294
01:01:19,343 --> 01:01:22,493
-How long were you two together?
           -Two years.

1295
01:01:22,513 --> 01:01:25,496
But I was in love with him
    for a decade before that.

1296
01:01:25,516 --> 01:01:27,349
And his wife never knew
           it was you?

1297
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,092
Jacob protected me

1298
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:31,186
Even after dottie asked him
        to break it off.

1299
01:01:33,598 --> 01:01:37,842
Did you two ever engage
      in any kind of games,

1300
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:40,696
-Use drugs, rohypnol?
           -No, never.

1301
01:01:42,849 --> 01:01:43,773
What'd you do
       when you found out

1302
01:01:43,926 --> 01:01:45,926
That he was going
       to the shady lady?

1303
01:01:45,944 --> 01:01:50,122
I didn't know.
    Not until after he died.

1304
01:01:51,266 --> 01:01:53,191
Okay, let me get this straight.

1305
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:55,268
He strung you along,
         then dumped you

1306
01:01:55,361 --> 01:01:56,286
And went back to his wife,

1307
01:01:56,438 --> 01:01:59,122
And you begged
       for another chance,

1308
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:02,551
Yet he would rather
     hang out at a brothel?

1309
01:02:02,778 --> 01:02:04,553
You must have been madder
        than all get out.

1310
01:02:04,704 --> 01:02:06,221
Try heartbroken.

1311
01:02:07,373 --> 01:02:10,892
I loved jake,
     and I didn't kill him.

1312
01:02:11,044 --> 01:02:12,060
Then who did?

1313
01:02:12,287 --> 01:02:14,804
[sobs] a lot of people
       didn't like jacob.

1314
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:17,733
He got threats just like you.

1315
01:02:17,884 --> 01:02:20,902
Most of them were anonymous
   and he never reported them.

1316
01:02:22,314 --> 01:02:25,482
He always said if someone
      didn't want you dead,

1317
01:02:25,634 --> 01:02:27,058
Then you weren't doing your job.

1318
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:30,078
So, do you think he was killed
  because of one of his cases?

1319
01:02:31,306 --> 01:02:33,248
I honestly don't know.

1320
01:02:35,494 --> 01:02:37,978
Please believe me, judge.

1321
01:02:37,996 --> 01:02:42,090
[gentle suspenseful music]

1322
01:02:44,503 --> 01:02:47,504
Kris:
  Do you think this love letter
       will help clear me?

1323
01:02:47,656 --> 01:02:50,081
Well, it's enough to bring up
   reasonable doubt at trial,

1324
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,434
But I doubt the da'll
        drop the charges.

1325
01:02:52,585 --> 01:02:54,919
Glad you're both here.
     Discovery came through.

1326
01:02:55,013 --> 01:02:56,438
-Did you get the autopsy report?
            -Mm-hmm.

1327
01:02:56,665 --> 01:03:00,834
Forensic shows judge brewer died
 from an overdose of oxycontin.

1328
01:03:00,852 --> 01:03:03,019
Administered intravenously
     under the hallux nail.

1329
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:04,354
-The what?
        -The big toenail.

1330
01:03:04,506 --> 01:03:06,597
That's where they can hide
       the injection mark.

1331
01:03:06,691 --> 01:03:08,116
You mean like a junkie?

1332
01:03:08,268 --> 01:03:12,270
That explains the rohypnol.
  Judge brewer's a big old boy.

1333
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:13,771
For the killer to inject him,

1334
01:03:13,791 --> 01:03:15,365
He'd have to incapacitate
           him first.

1335
01:03:15,459 --> 01:03:17,108
Meaning whoever did this

1336
01:03:17,202 --> 01:03:19,461
Likely has experience
         with iv drugs.

1337
01:03:19,688 --> 01:03:21,871
-Kim: Mm-hmm.
   -Which I definitely do not.

[notification dings]

1339
01:03:25,027 --> 01:03:26,617
Crap. I gotta be somewhere.

1340
01:03:26,711 --> 01:03:28,428
-Check you later, thanks.
          -Kris: Yeah.

1341
01:03:30,474 --> 01:03:31,973

      This is looking good.

[gentle upbeat music]

1343
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:40,482
Kim:
    So, you two make a deal?

1344
01:03:40,633 --> 01:03:42,484
[clears throat]
   that's correct, your honor.

1345
01:03:42,711 --> 01:03:45,278
-Okay, thank you so much.
            -Welcome.

1346
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,568
So, your client agrees
 to these terms mr. Goodlander?

1347
01:03:51,662 --> 01:03:55,664
Yes, judge. The terms
       are more than fair.

1348
01:03:55,815 --> 01:03:57,073
Okie dokie.

1349
01:03:57,225 --> 01:03:59,835
I'll set sentencing tomorrow
      1:00 p.M. In tonopah.

1350
01:04:01,154 --> 01:04:03,154
-Thank you.
       -Thank you, judge.

1351
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:05,841
-Ellis, you got a second?
           -Uh, sure.

1352

-[inhaler whistles]
        -[clears throat]

1353
01:04:10,572 --> 01:04:11,847
So, according to forensics,

1354
01:04:11,998 --> 01:04:13,664
The drug that
       killed judge brewer

1355
01:04:13,758 --> 01:04:15,475
Was injected under the toenail.

1356
01:04:18,246 --> 01:04:19,412
So?

1357
01:04:19,431 --> 01:04:21,189
So, clearly the killer
     was trying to hide it,

1358
01:04:21,416 --> 01:04:24,175
Make it look like
         a heart attack.

1359
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:27,362
So, we're looking for someone
    with iv drug experience.

1360
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:30,940
It's a theory,
     but like most theories,

1361
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:33,109
It's long in imagination,
       short in evidence.

1362
01:04:33,203 --> 01:04:35,261
[laughs]

1363
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,205
It wasn't an accidental
      overdose, counselor.

1364
01:04:37,357 --> 01:04:39,949
It was premeditated.
   You can't just ignore that.

1365
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:42,043
Are you trying to bully me,
         judge wheeler?

1366
01:04:42,195 --> 01:04:45,005
No, I'm trying to make you
    do your job, mr. Dinkins.

1367
01:04:46,884 --> 01:04:48,550
You have any idea why goodlander

1368
01:04:48,777 --> 01:04:51,052
Was so anxious to settle
       the crawford case?

1369
01:04:51,279 --> 01:04:52,370
Why?

1370
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:54,948
Because he's worried
      you're a loose cannon

1371
01:04:55,041 --> 01:04:57,283
Running around
     in everyone's business.

1372
01:04:57,377 --> 01:04:59,710
He doesn't trust his case
     with you on the bench.

1373
01:04:59,804 --> 01:05:01,287
That's a bunch of bull.

1374
01:05:01,306 --> 01:05:03,790
He has a weak defense
        and he knows it.

1375
01:05:03,808 --> 01:05:05,642
That may be,

1376
01:05:05,736 --> 01:05:08,144
But I'm gonna tell you
       something for free.

1377
01:05:08,296 --> 01:05:10,572
I'd be careful ruffling
       too many feathers.

1378
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:13,800
Is that a threat, ellis?

1379
01:05:13,818 --> 01:05:16,036
'cause that sounds
      like a threat to me.

1380
01:05:17,155 --> 01:05:19,155
It's just a friendly
         warning, judge.

1381

[dramatic tense music]

Kim:
      Hey, I need you to go
             through
     the drug court records,

1385
01:05:34,823 --> 01:05:37,081
Compile me a list of
      all the iv drug users

1386
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,750
And then crosscheck that list

1387
01:05:39,844 --> 01:05:42,253
To see if any of them
  are still living in the area.

1388
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:43,587
How far do you want me
           to go back?

1389
01:05:43,682 --> 01:05:46,499
As far as you can.
 I know it's gonna take a while.

-Don't worry. I'm on it.
        -Awesome possum.

So, you really think
         brewer's killer

1393
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:53,097
Came through drug court?

1394
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:56,192
Well, it's a lead we definitely
       need to check out.

1395
01:05:56,344 --> 01:05:58,361
If dinkins won't do it,
         that leaves us.

Mm-hmm.

Would you say
       I'm a loose cannon?

No, no, no.

1399

At least not to your face.

     sentenced to two years

In the southern desert
       correctional center

In indian springs
  with credit for time served.

Eligibility for parole
    will be at the discretion

Of the parole board,

And I'm suspending
      your driver's license

1411
01:06:49,006 --> 01:06:51,989
For one year
      pending your release.

Thank you, your honor.

Keep your shirt on,
         mr. Goodlander.

I'm not finished.

1415
01:06:57,239 --> 01:07:00,473
Mr. Crawford, it's clear to me
that you have issues with anger,

1416
01:07:01,685 --> 01:07:04,352
So I hereby order to you
      to complete 52 hours

1417
01:07:04,504 --> 01:07:09,190
Of anger management classes
      at your own expense,

1418
01:07:09,342 --> 01:07:11,675
And prior to release,
    you will appear before me

1419
01:07:11,695 --> 01:07:13,253
To explain what you've learned

1420
01:07:13,271 --> 01:07:17,532
And why something like this
 will never, ever happen again.

1421
01:07:19,277 --> 01:07:22,262
We'll all make mistakes,
          mr. Crawford,

1422
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,873
But yours cost
      a young man his life,

1423
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:28,268
Someone who by all accounts
       was a close friend,

1424
01:07:28,361 --> 01:07:33,439
Someone who apparently
     will never get to enjoy

1425
01:07:33,458 --> 01:07:37,052
The opportunities
   that you so easily disdain.

1426
01:07:37,279 --> 01:07:39,946
That young man
   will never have the chance

1427
01:07:39,964 --> 01:07:42,448
To fulfill his promise,

1428
01:07:42,467 --> 01:07:45,060
But you can honor him
      by not wasting yours.

1429
01:07:47,956 --> 01:07:51,232
Do your time, mr. Crawford.
          Make amends.

1430
01:07:51,384 --> 01:07:53,234
And the next time we meet,

1431
01:07:53,386 --> 01:07:58,073
Impress me with your resolve
   to become a better person.

Because trust this,
 you won't like me disappointed.

    between passing sentence

And passing judgment.

And admitted what he did.

Says he wants to make up
    for all of his mistakes.

Well, I hope that's true.

What you said to him really
  hit home and I appreciate it.

So, can I buy you dinner
         to say thanks?

      you moving back here.

Well, it's certainly
       an acquired taste.

Hmm.

1489
01:10:33,546 --> 01:10:35,788
Well, how about you?
        Why'd you leave?

1490
01:10:35,807 --> 01:10:39,383
Well, when mama passed,
       my daddy and sister

1491
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:41,218
Started fighting
       like cats and dogs,

And then kris,
      she left home and...

1493
01:10:45,967 --> 01:10:48,801
Daddy started taking
   his frustrations out on me.

-He was abusive.
    -Well, emotionally, yeah.

Then I left.

I ran off to vegas
    and got a job at a casino

So, after you drugged the judge,

01:15:16,738 --> 01:15:18,513
You followed him on
     down to the shady lady
