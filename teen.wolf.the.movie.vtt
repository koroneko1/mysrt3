01:14.719 --> 01:17.052
[thunder cracking]

01:17.119 --> 01:21.486
- When is a door not a door?

01:21.519 --> 01:22.851
- Sorry?

01:22.918 --> 01:26.485
- When is a door not a door?

01:29.185 --> 01:30.818
- She doesn't understand.

01:30.885 --> 01:33.050
- Well, it's a riddle.

01:33.117 --> 01:34.551
I think she understands
perfectly.

01:34.618 --> 01:37.550
So I'll ask one more time.

01:37.617 --> 01:41.484
When is a door not a door?

01:41.484 --> 01:43.017
- When it's "ajar."

01:43.083 --> 01:46.484
- Like one of those.

01:46.484 --> 01:49.483
The jar I'm looking for
has a special symbol on it,

01:49.483 --> 01:53.116
a triskelion,
three spirals connected.

01:53.182 --> 01:55.783
- We don't know what
you're talking about.

01:55.849 --> 01:57.215
Maybe you should leave.

01:57.282 --> 01:59.248
- Oh.

01:59.315 --> 02:02.582
It's a very special jar,
actually.

02:02.648 --> 02:04.848
It was made from the wood
of a sacred tree

02:04.915 --> 02:08.914
and used to capture
a dark Kitsune--

02:08.981 --> 02:12.147
a trickster spirit
called Nogitsune.

02:12.214 --> 02:15.681
- Well, all these jars
contain are teas and spices.

02:15.747 --> 02:17.647
- So whatever it is you
came here looking for--

02:17.714 --> 02:20.481
- You know exactly what I came
here looking for, Mr. Dunbar.

02:33.912 --> 02:35.480
- [roaring]

03:07.477 --> 03:08.376
Hikari!

03:11.076 --> 03:14.208
[roaring]

03:17.941 --> 03:19.141
- No!

03:22.575 --> 03:23.608
- No!

03:26.140 --> 03:27.775
You don't know
what you're doing!

03:27.841 --> 03:31.774
- I've been searching
for this for years.

03:31.840 --> 03:34.207
I know precisely what I'm doing.

03:34.274 --> 03:36.540
- You can't control it.

03:36.607 --> 03:37.507
- I don't want to.

03:47.739 --> 03:51.038
- Set me free.

03:51.105 --> 03:52.905
- Not until
you make me a promise.

03:52.972 --> 03:56.805
- What fool would ask a promise
from a trickster spirit?

03:56.872 --> 03:59.371
- Call it a mutually
beneficial arrangement.

03:59.472 --> 04:02.472
If you're as all powerful and
omniscient as they say.

04:02.472 --> 04:04.904
then you already know
what I want.

04:04.971 --> 04:08.537
- You want retribution

04:08.604 --> 04:11.604
against him,

04:11.671 --> 04:14.936
his friends,

04:15.003 --> 04:19.070
and everyone he loves.

04:19.136 --> 04:22.269
Set me free

04:22.335 --> 04:26.503
and we'll play a new game,

04:26.570 --> 04:28.470
a game of chaos,

04:28.470 --> 04:30.902
strife,

04:30.969 --> 04:34.202
and pain!

[sirens wailing]

04:54.767 --> 04:58.700
[police radio chatter]

04:58.767 --> 04:59.833
- You said it wouldn't bite.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.633
- I said it wouldn't bite me.

05:01.700 --> 05:03.132
But that's also
because I wouldn't

05:03.199 --> 05:07.132
put my hand in front of
the mouth of a frightened dog.

05:07.199 --> 05:08.699
- Thanks for the advice.

05:08.766 --> 05:10.298
You got any idea how we're going
to get it out of there?

05:10.365 --> 05:12.198
- I have someone coming
who has a special talent

05:12.265 --> 05:13.532
for these kinds of things.

05:13.599 --> 05:15.365
He runs the animal shelter
next to my clinic.

05:15.466 --> 05:18.465
Trust me, he's highly qualified.

05:18.531 --> 05:19.931
We even have a nickname for him.

05:19.998 --> 05:21.465
- Oh yeah? What?

05:21.531 --> 05:24.164
- We call him "The Alpha."

05:41.496 --> 05:42.763
- The girl climbed out,

05:42.829 --> 05:44.228
tried to pull it out,
lost her footing,

05:44.295 --> 05:47.729
and ended up falling in too.

05:47.796 --> 05:48.828
Is that all you got?

05:48.895 --> 05:50.162
No protective gear?
No gloves?

05:50.228 --> 05:51.528
- I don't get bit.

05:51.595 --> 05:54.062
Even if I did, I usually
heal pretty fast.

05:54.128 --> 05:57.194
- Well, even so...

05:57.261 --> 05:58.227
[dog barking]

05:58.294 --> 05:59.762
- No! He's gonna bite!

06:00.927 --> 06:02.094
- Hey there.

06:02.161 --> 06:03.462
My name is Scott.

06:03.494 --> 06:04.727
I'm going to help
get you guys out of here.

06:04.794 --> 06:05.727
- [screams]

06:20.059 --> 06:21.593
[whimpering]

06:29.192 --> 06:30.692
- Scott, hurry! Come on!

06:30.759 --> 06:31.692
Get out of there!

06:37.324 --> 06:38.458
- [screams]

06:42.458 --> 06:43.658
- All right, climb onto me.

06:43.724 --> 06:44.890
Climb onto me.

06:44.957 --> 06:45.890
- [screams]

06:47.923 --> 06:49.458
- [screams]

06:58.056 --> 06:59.956
- Come on, Alicia.

07:00.022 --> 07:01.222
I got you.

07:19.488 --> 07:22.054
- That was close.

07:22.120 --> 07:24.020
[sirens wailing]

07:24.087 --> 07:25.487
Hey, Alicia? You guys?

07:25.554 --> 07:30.587
Let's go see the paramedics, OK?

07:30.654 --> 07:32.454
- What do you guys
call him again?

07:32.454 --> 07:34.086
- The Alpha.

07:34.153 --> 07:36.319
- Right, like a dog.

07:36.453 --> 07:39.252
- No, like a wolf.

07:45.486 --> 07:48.585
[dramatic music]

08:39.313 --> 08:40.481
[thunder cracks]

08:48.947 --> 08:51.212
- Good boy.

08:51.279 --> 08:53.279
- OK. Come here, buddy.

08:58.112 --> 09:00.146
Do you know why
Cooper bit the lieutenant?

09:00.211 --> 09:01.446
- Because he was scared?

09:01.479 --> 09:02.945
- He was scared for you.

09:03.011 --> 09:06.978
It's one of the best parts
about dogs, they fight for us.

09:07.045 --> 09:10.278
Remember, the same way that we
see them as part of our family,

09:10.344 --> 09:11.811
they see us
as part of their pack.

09:24.209 --> 09:25.610
- There's still time.

09:28.209 --> 09:30.043
- Oh, I know.

09:30.109 --> 09:31.843
Yeah, I'll have kids
one of these days,

09:31.909 --> 09:35.909
after I find someone,
or someone finds me, I guess.

09:35.976 --> 09:40.708
- Yeah, I meant there's still
time to beat traffic.

09:40.775 --> 09:45.508
But if you want to talk,
there's still time for that too.

09:45.575 --> 09:49.874
- I think I was just,
maybe feeling kind of, uh--

09:49.941 --> 09:51.442
- Wistful.

09:53.442 --> 09:56.974
It means a kind of
longing or regret,

09:57.041 --> 09:59.441
a sort of melancholy
about the past

09:59.507 --> 10:01.474
and the choices we've made.

10:04.206 --> 10:06.373
- Wistful.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.840
- Why don't you lock up?
I'll get my stuff.

10:20.139 --> 10:21.439
[knocking]

10:21.505 --> 10:25.838
[dogs barking]

10:25.904 --> 10:27.304
- [sobbing]
I didn't see him.

10:27.371 --> 10:29.338
I took my eyes off the road
for, like, two seconds!

10:29.405 --> 10:30.538
- Quiet!

10:36.303 --> 10:38.370
[sighs]

10:42.303 --> 10:43.870
[door locks]

10:46.269 --> 10:49.836
[barking continues]

11:17.600 --> 11:19.067
Oh! Jesus!

11:22.933 --> 11:24.133
Hey.

11:25.633 --> 11:27.633
Shit, dude.

11:27.699 --> 11:29.298
You know you could just
use the front door, right?

11:29.433 --> 11:33.633
- I never use the front door.

11:33.699 --> 11:35.566
Especially when it's not safe.

11:35.633 --> 11:37.698
- Who says it's not safe?

11:43.064 --> 11:44.732
- You're seeing her too.

11:46.432 --> 11:48.432
I mean, I've dreamt about her.

11:48.465 --> 11:50.031
You know, now and then
over the years

11:50.097 --> 11:55.096
I've had images flicker in front
of my eyes like blurry photos.

11:55.163 --> 11:59.431
And then, two weeks ago,
something changed.

11:59.431 --> 12:02.530
Those random images

12:02.596 --> 12:05.696
flickering through
my head got clearer.

12:05.763 --> 12:08.596
I saw flashes of her crying out,

12:08.663 --> 12:10.430
silently screaming in pain,

12:10.430 --> 12:11.430
in agony.

12:11.496 --> 12:13.862
She was suffering.

12:13.929 --> 12:16.194
- Allison.

12:16.261 --> 12:20.429
- But I started seeing her face
more and more.

12:20.462 --> 12:23.529
And then I started
hearing her voice.

12:23.594 --> 12:27.428
And I can hear somebody
whispering to me.

12:27.428 --> 12:28.428
- Whispering what?

12:28.428 --> 12:31.428
- One word, and only one.

12:31.461 --> 12:33.628
I hear it every time I go to
sleep and every time I wake up,

12:33.693 --> 12:36.227
and I only wake up
from nightmares.

12:36.293 --> 12:37.227
- What word?

12:40.259 --> 12:41.460
- Bardo.

12:46.427 --> 12:49.892
Uh, I--I, uh--

12:49.959 --> 12:51.291
I was on the phone the other day
and I was writing down

12:51.426 --> 12:52.626
a client's number.

12:52.692 --> 12:55.592
But instead of the number,
I wrote that.

13:00.025 --> 13:02.425
- Scott, do you know
what bardo is?

13:02.491 --> 13:03.958
- A state between
life and death.

13:04.025 --> 13:05.124
- You and I,
we're both seeing her.

13:05.190 --> 13:07.190
We're both speaking
the same word.

13:07.257 --> 13:08.425
It's not just a dream.

13:08.491 --> 13:10.524
Allison is caught between
life and death.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.624
- It's not that simple.

13:12.690 --> 13:13.990
Bardo is a Tibetan word.

13:14.057 --> 13:15.524
It's a means of
interpreting death

13:15.590 --> 13:16.956
and the movements
of consciousness

13:17.023 --> 13:19.289
between physical states
of being.

13:19.424 --> 13:21.556
It's just a word.

13:21.623 --> 13:22.889
It's a concept.

13:22.956 --> 13:24.556
- Well, that fucking concept
is waking me up

13:24.623 --> 13:26.122
in the middle of the night
in a cold sweat,

13:26.188 --> 13:30.055
telling me my daughter
is still out there!

13:30.122 --> 13:31.589
- She can't be.

13:31.655 --> 13:34.588
I mean, she--
she died in my arms.

13:34.655 --> 13:37.187
I felt her slip away from me.

13:37.254 --> 13:38.522
- I know we all die.

13:38.588 --> 13:41.755
I'm not pretending to know
what happens next.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.754
But if there was something
after this life, some next step,

13:44.821 --> 13:46.421
I don't think she made it.

13:46.487 --> 13:50.053
And I think she's trying to
tell us she never crossed over.

13:50.120 --> 13:51.421
[thunder booms]

13:51.487 --> 13:53.986
- It's been 15 years.

13:54.053 --> 13:57.420
- Let's say we accept all this.

13:57.453 --> 13:59.553
What can we actually do to help?

13:59.620 --> 14:02.520
- There's a--a--
a ritual of some kind.

14:02.586 --> 14:04.285
I know a few details.

14:04.420 --> 14:07.119
I got a feeling the real answers
are in Beacon Hills.

14:10.419 --> 14:11.552
- OK.

14:11.619 --> 14:13.852
What else can you say
for certain?

14:13.919 --> 14:16.051
- It has to be done by
the next full moon.

14:16.118 --> 14:18.984
And if it's not,
we don't get another chance.

14:20.484 --> 14:21.718
- I'm not sure.

14:21.784 --> 14:25.117
And I'll admit,
I'm a little scared.

14:25.183 --> 14:27.584
We're talking about
dangerous rituals,

14:27.651 --> 14:29.650
thousands of years old.

14:29.717 --> 14:31.250
There are going to
be repercussions.

14:31.317 --> 14:34.150
- So can somebody
just say one thing?

14:34.217 --> 14:37.249
Are we doing this or not?

14:37.316 --> 14:38.849
- Well, the message
was for you, Scott.

14:38.916 --> 14:40.316
It's yours to answer.

14:40.417 --> 14:41.417
- It's more than a message.

14:47.148 --> 14:50.081
This is the sword
that killed her.

14:50.148 --> 14:52.416
Her blood

14:52.482 --> 14:55.415
stained the blade.

14:55.481 --> 14:57.715
- I haven't been to Beacon Hills
in a long time.

15:00.415 --> 15:03.147
- None of us have.

15:03.214 --> 15:05.814
But if you drive out tomorrow,
I can meet you there

15:05.880 --> 15:08.680
by afternoon.

15:08.747 --> 15:10.947
- We're gonna need more help.

15:11.014 --> 15:12.414
- And more answers.

15:15.179 --> 15:18.213
- Yeah, I'm gonna need to find
some old friends.

15:20.613 --> 15:23.513
- Sound energy--
I'm speaking specifically

15:23.579 --> 15:26.145
of the sounds that fill
our acoustic environment.

15:26.212 --> 15:28.312
Our current ability to harness
those sounds,

15:28.413 --> 15:31.112
as not only
a renewable energy source,

15:31.178 --> 15:34.077
but as a green sustainable
electric energy.

15:34.144 --> 15:36.412
- Lydia, I hate to
interrupt you, especially

15:36.445 --> 15:38.977
since you're going full throttle
with this tech shit

15:39.044 --> 15:40.445
that none of us really seem
to understand.

15:40.511 --> 15:42.677
- Thanks for the input, Rick,
and for not interrupting.

15:42.744 --> 15:45.044
- Yeah. Lyd, listen--
- Continuing on,

15:45.110 --> 15:47.544
research into energy harvesting,

15:47.611 --> 15:48.910
up until now--

15:48.976 --> 15:51.010
- Lydia, I just have one tiny,
little question.

15:51.076 --> 15:52.776
Lyd--
- Stop calling me Lyd.

15:52.843 --> 15:54.410
- Lydia!
- Rick.

15:54.410 --> 15:55.810
For someone who hates
to interrupt,

15:55.876 --> 15:58.109
you seem oddly compelled
to keep doing it.

15:58.175 --> 16:01.775

at the auto shop?

It wasn't gasoline.

19:17.692 --> 19:19.992
Whoever set this fire used
a chemical accelerant.

19:20.058 --> 19:21.792
- Four fires in two weeks.

That's a serial arsonist.

to do with Stiles.

never to tell Ethan,

can we just stop
before either of us

completely embarrassing?

as pretty embarrassing.

I don't want to punish you.

I'd like to maybe understand
what you think you were doing.

my friends after the game.

27:34.615 --> 27:36.249
What is wrong with that?

27:36.350 --> 27:37.815
- You're 15,
you don't have a license,

27:37.882 --> 27:39.149
and it's called
breaking the law.

27:39.214 --> 27:41.015
- You never broke the law?

27:41.081 --> 27:42.415
- OK. You know what?

If this is about
the other thing,

27:43.881 --> 27:45.181
then let's talk about
the other thing.

27:45.248 --> 27:46.581
- I don't want to talk to you
about anything.

27:46.648 --> 27:47.914
- I wouldn't push it
if it wasn't a thing.

27:47.981 --> 27:49.714
But we both know
it's not just anything,

27:49.781 --> 27:51.448
and now it's
definitely something.

27:51.514 --> 27:53.047
- I don't even know what
you're talking about.

27:53.113 --> 27:54.348
Are you listening to yourself?

27:54.381 --> 27:55.548
You sound drunk.

27:55.614 --> 27:57.713

have to learn.

28:04.613 --> 28:06.046
It's who you are.
You're a Hale.

28:06.112 --> 28:07.513
- I'll change my name.

28:07.580 --> 28:09.079
- That won't change the fact
that you're a werewolf!

28:09.146 --> 28:10.512
- And what if I'm not?

28:12.479 --> 28:14.879
Maybe that's why
I can't turn into one?

28:14.946 --> 28:17.346
You know, what if I'm
the first ever Hale

28:17.379 --> 28:18.911
not to turn into a werewolf?

28:22.978 --> 28:24.245
- To be honest,

28:24.345 --> 28:26.411
it would probably make
life a little easier.

28:26.478 --> 28:28.910
- Yeah, for me?

28:28.977 --> 28:30.010

practice before the game.

You know, basketball was
really always more my thing.

30:03.403 --> 30:05.969
But, uh, I think
I'm getting better.

30:06.036 --> 30:08.502
Maybe you can show me
some tricks?

30:21.001 --> 30:22.100
Or maybe not.

30:55.732 --> 30:57.565
- You're giving me
that look again.

- What look?

31:02.697 --> 31:05.764
- The relationship look.

31:05.831 --> 31:08.397
- Oh.
- Yeah, that look.

31:08.464 --> 31:10.431
- Did I say anything?

31:10.497 --> 31:13.431
- You said it with a look.

31:13.497 --> 31:15.364
And I'm not changing my mind.

31:15.431 --> 31:17.163
- And I'm not asking you to.

31:17.230 --> 31:18.230

But your look is.

- All right.

talking about it--

31:30.329 --> 31:31.829
Sorry.

I got to go.

- Looking for answers.

any recent trips to Japan.

- Oh, for the love of God.
Come on.

32:28.857 --> 32:30.757
- Oh! I missed you!

- No, you didn't.

to see you.

- I know.

32:48.522 --> 32:49.988
- OK!

32:50.055 --> 32:52.187
Let's go find a tree
in the woods.

33:01.354 --> 33:02.787
Come on.

33:02.854 --> 33:04.321
You said we need to find
this thing by nightfall.

33:10.953 --> 33:14.420
- I haven't been to Japan
in years.

33:14.486 --> 33:15.686
- Are you sure about that?

33:15.753 --> 33:17.219
- Positive.

33:17.320 --> 33:19.819
How long has it been since
you were in Beacon Hills?

33:19.885 --> 33:21.052
Because I seem to remember
you telling us that

33:21.119 --> 33:22.985
you were going to stay
in Los Angeles.

33:23.052 --> 33:25.752
- I was, but I wanted to ask you
another question.

33:25.819 --> 33:30.385
And it, um, it might
sound a little strange.

33:30.452 --> 33:34.218
You walk into a room
that contains a match,

33:34.319 --> 33:38.351
a kerosene lamp,
a candle, and a fireplace.

33:38.418 --> 33:40.017
What would you light first?

33:40.083 --> 33:41.217
- The match.

33:43.183 --> 33:45.717
You came all this way to
Beacon Hills to ask me that?

33:45.783 --> 33:48.450
- I do have another question.

33:48.517 --> 33:50.983
What has to be broken
before it can be used?

33:51.049 --> 33:53.683
- An egg.

33:53.750 --> 33:56.317
- I'm tall when I'm young,

33:56.383 --> 33:58.649
and I'm short when I'm old.

33:58.716 --> 34:02.316
What am I?
- A candle.

34:02.349 --> 34:04.582
Do you want to talk
about that bullet,

34:04.649 --> 34:06.848
or you want to keep
asking me children's riddles?

34:06.915 --> 34:08.715
- What month of the year
has 28 days?

34:08.781 --> 34:11.315
- All of them.

34:11.315 --> 34:12.715
- What has many keys--

34:12.781 --> 34:14.648
- Stop.

34:14.715 --> 34:16.381
Stop talking.

34:16.448 --> 34:19.814
- What has many keys
yet opens no locks?

34:19.880 --> 34:21.147
- A piano.

34:21.214 --> 34:23.080
- What has many teeth
but cannot bite?

34:23.147 --> 34:24.780
- A comb.

34:29.447 --> 34:31.713
- What is always in front of you
but can never be seen?

34:31.779 --> 34:34.179
- The future.

34:34.313 --> 34:36.713
- The more of this there is,
the less you can see.

34:36.779 --> 34:39.778
What is it?

34:39.845 --> 34:42.313
- Darkness, you motherfucker!

34:42.313 --> 34:45.378
[exciting music]

35:06.576 --> 35:07.643
- It's me.

35:07.710 --> 35:09.310
Um, hey, we're still looking.

35:09.376 --> 35:13.209
Just getting a little worried
about meeting up on time.

35:13.310 --> 35:17.310
So just give me a call
or text, anything.

35:19.542 --> 35:21.775
Mm.

35:21.842 --> 35:23.475
OK.

35:28.808 --> 35:30.174
Ah!

35:30.309 --> 35:31.441
It's this way.

35:31.508 --> 35:32.641
It's this way.

35:32.708 --> 35:34.073
- [mutters]

35:38.973 --> 35:42.040
- What is it?

35:42.107 --> 35:43.340
- Someone's following us.

35:46.707 --> 35:49.407
They've been following us
pretty much the whole time.

35:49.473 --> 35:51.106
- Who?

35:53.972 --> 35:55.072
- Here, come here!

35:55.139 --> 35:56.306
- Wait, wait,
I wasn't doing anything!

35:56.306 --> 35:57.372
Sorry!

35:57.439 --> 35:58.672
Uh.

35:58.739 --> 36:00.672
- It is you.

36:00.739 --> 36:03.005
- Eli, Derek's son.

36:03.071 --> 36:04.538
- Wow, you've gotten really big.

36:04.605 --> 36:06.105
- Yeah, It's probably
because I was only three

36:06.171 --> 36:07.771
the last time you saw me.

36:07.838 --> 36:09.371
- What are you doing out here?

36:09.438 --> 36:11.405
- I was kind of wondering what
you guys were doing out here.

36:11.471 --> 36:12.638
- Hiking.

36:12.705 --> 36:13.870
Can't you tell?

36:13.937 --> 36:15.137
It's a really nice night
for hiking.

36:15.204 --> 36:16.537
- I know what
you're looking for.

36:16.604 --> 36:17.837
The tree, right?

36:17.904 --> 36:19.203
That huge stump's that's
like 20-feet wide?

36:19.304 --> 36:20.937
- You know how to find it?

36:21.003 --> 36:22.504
- Kind of.

36:22.570 --> 36:23.704
I sleepwalk.

36:23.769 --> 36:25.136
I don't know why.

36:25.203 --> 36:26.836
But I've just been doing it
for the last few months.

36:26.903 --> 36:28.703
- I used to wake up
in the woods too.

36:28.769 --> 36:30.836
- After you were bit
by Peter, right?

36:30.903 --> 36:32.569
- Yeah, your dad tell you
a few stories?

36:32.636 --> 36:33.803
- Yeah, all of 'em.

36:33.869 --> 36:35.703
- What about the tree?

36:35.768 --> 36:36.968
- It's not far from here.

36:37.035 --> 36:38.135
- I knew we were going
the right way.

36:38.202 --> 36:39.303
- No, you were going
the wrong way.

36:39.369 --> 36:41.135
It's that way.
- We were circling back.

36:41.202 --> 36:42.735
- Hm.
- Thank you.

36:42.802 --> 36:43.802
- Well, I can help you find it.

36:43.868 --> 36:45.867
- Got it.
- Hey, come on.

36:52.567 --> 36:54.601
- What are you doing?

36:54.667 --> 36:57.501
[indistinct chatter]

37:00.833 --> 37:03.466
- So aren't you the screamer?

37:03.533 --> 37:04.800
- Banshee.

37:04.866 --> 37:06.333
- Yeah, but banshees scream,
right?

37:06.400 --> 37:09.766
- Well, they wail if you want
to get technical, but yes.

37:09.832 --> 37:11.165
- So how loud can you scream?

37:11.300 --> 37:12.999
Loud enough to create a burst
of acoustic energy

37:13.065 --> 37:15.099
that could crush your skull.

37:15.165 --> 37:17.499
- Good to know.

37:17.565 --> 37:19.898
- There it is.

37:19.964 --> 37:22.332
OK. OK.

37:23.998 --> 37:25.332
So what should we do
about Argent?

37:25.399 --> 37:28.764
- Uh, I mean, I'm never
gonna get a signal now.

37:28.831 --> 37:30.063
Even if he's texting me,
I wouldn't know.

37:30.130 --> 37:31.664
- Well, we're going to
have to do this now.

37:31.731 --> 37:32.897
We can't wait for him.

37:32.963 --> 37:34.197
- It's his daughter.

37:34.298 --> 37:35.997
- You said it has to be tonight.

37:36.063 --> 37:37.997
He would want us to do this
without him.

37:40.730 --> 37:42.363
Don't you have something to do?

37:42.430 --> 37:43.497
- Yeah.

37:43.563 --> 37:44.996
Yeah, I have a lacrosse game
to play.

37:45.062 --> 37:46.463
Well, more like a lacrosse
game to show up to

37:46.530 --> 37:49.297
since I, like,
I never get to play.

37:51.929 --> 37:53.429
Oh! You want me to leave?

37:53.496 --> 37:55.596
OK. Uh, I got it.

37:55.662 --> 37:57.529
OK, well, I'll tell my dad
that I saw you guys?

37:57.596 --> 37:59.595
- No, don't.

37:59.661 --> 38:00.761
Don't tell him anything.

38:00.828 --> 38:04.194
This is kind of--
- Personal.

38:04.295 --> 38:05.795
- All right. Don't worry.

38:05.861 --> 38:07.927
I won't say anything.

38:18.794 --> 38:19.826
- All right.

38:19.893 --> 38:21.494
Now what?

38:23.993 --> 38:25.659
- OK.

38:29.925 --> 38:32.792
Why are you looking at me?

38:32.858 --> 38:34.426
I didn't write the instructions.

38:34.492 --> 38:35.825
- Yeah, you did.

38:35.892 --> 38:37.325
You literally wrote
the instructions.

38:37.392 --> 38:39.124
Okay, you know what I mean.

38:47.657 --> 38:48.924
- Do you feel that?

38:48.991 --> 38:50.657
Yeah.

39:10.555 --> 39:12.989
- What the hell?

39:13.055 --> 39:14.789
Uh...

39:14.855 --> 39:17.788
[exciting music]

39:17.854 --> 39:24.988

39:41.952 --> 39:43.019
- OK.

39:43.086 --> 39:44.419
That was fun.

39:44.486 --> 39:46.019
Um, you guys want to go
get something to eat now?

39:56.718 --> 39:59.018
- I know.

40:17.484 --> 40:19.049
- Hey, guys.

40:29.249 --> 40:32.148
[mysterious music]

40:32.215 --> 40:39.348
* *

40:44.947 --> 40:46.180
It's Allison.

40:54.046 --> 40:56.080
She's alive.

41:05.945 --> 41:07.812
This can't be real.

41:07.879 --> 41:08.945
It can't be her.

41:09.012 --> 41:10.178
She was cremated.

41:10.279 --> 41:11.512
- She looks pretty
un-cremated to me.

41:11.579 --> 41:12.944
- She's not just un-cremated.

41:13.011 --> 41:15.279
She's literally been
reconstituted out of thin air.

41:15.279 --> 41:18.144
- So that wasn't in
the instructions?

41:20.744 --> 41:22.444
I got a question.

41:22.511 --> 41:24.544
What do we do when she wakes up?

41:24.611 --> 41:26.278
- If she wakes up.

41:31.142 --> 41:33.577
We need some help.

41:35.076 --> 41:36.310
- Mom, we got a problem.

41:40.176 --> 41:43.141
- She looks just like Allison.

41:43.276 --> 41:46.975
Why, Scott, does she look
exactly like Allison?

41:47.041 --> 41:48.609
- You really want to know?

41:48.675 --> 41:50.908
- Just get her inside.

41:50.975 --> 41:52.641
OK.

42:37.637 --> 42:41.904
- Chaos!

42:41.971 --> 42:46.003
Strife!

42:46.070 --> 42:48.870
Pain!

[rock music]

42:51.936 --> 42:54.570

42:54.636 --> 42:55.736
- Listen up!

42:55.802 --> 42:59.169
Tonight's game
is not just a game.

42:59.270 --> 43:01.535
This is a preamble
to what comes tomorrow,

43:01.602 --> 43:06.635
an overture to a symphony
of victory!

43:06.702 --> 43:09.335
This tournament
is everything I've dreamed of

43:09.402 --> 43:11.269
my entire career
as a lacrosse coach.

43:11.302 --> 43:13.901
And that trophy is
going right here, boys.

43:13.968 --> 43:16.901
And I know none of you
will ruin it for me

43:16.967 --> 43:19.268
by losing this game tonight!

43:19.268 --> 43:20.334
Am I right?

43:20.401 --> 43:22.800
all: Yes, Coach!

43:22.867 --> 43:23.933
- Oh.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
It's just you.

43:25.067 --> 43:26.833
- Just me.

43:26.900 --> 43:28.767
But I'm here, with him.

43:32.932 --> 43:34.333
- We can talk about it later.

43:34.400 --> 43:35.566
I came to watch you play.

43:35.632 --> 43:36.866
- Well, prepare for
disappointment,

43:36.932 --> 43:40.898
'cause if you didn't notice,
I never play.

43:40.965 --> 43:43.931
- I noticed, and I'm going to
talk to your coach about it.

43:43.998 --> 43:45.266
- Oh, God, no! No, no!

43:45.299 --> 43:48.431
- Hey, Coach, can I have a word?
- Don't do that.

43:48.498 --> 43:51.997
- Eli,
you probably got the feeling

43:52.064 --> 43:54.398
that I'm not actually here
to watch your game.

43:54.465 --> 43:56.630
Yeah?
- Kinda.

43:56.697 --> 44:00.364
- And that maybe I'm here to
give my good friend, your dad,

44:00.430 --> 44:02.497
just a little support as
he deals with

44:02.564 --> 44:05.264
his somewhat delinquent son.

44:05.297 --> 44:06.264
- Maybe.

44:06.330 --> 44:07.929
- But I'm not.

44:07.996 --> 44:09.096
I'm here to warn you.

44:09.163 --> 44:10.363
You steal that Jeep again,

44:10.429 --> 44:12.296
I'm going to haul your ass
into a jail cell,

44:12.363 --> 44:13.796
have you tried as an adult,

44:13.863 --> 44:15.862
and watch you get sent
to the state penitentiary

44:15.928 --> 44:18.329
for a minimum of 90 days.

44:20.263 --> 44:22.328
- Did he tell you to scare me?

44:23.262 --> 44:24.628
- Maybe.

44:24.695 --> 44:26.562
Good luck with the game, Eli.

44:26.628 --> 44:27.927
Yeah.

44:34.794 --> 44:36.361
What do you think about my son
getting a little playing time

44:36.427 --> 44:38.427
tonight?
- I think that's a great idea.

44:38.494 --> 44:39.627
- You don't know who my son is,
do you?

44:39.694 --> 44:41.160
- I don't know who you are.

44:41.261 --> 44:44.893
But you look pretty athletic,

44:44.960 --> 44:47.726
so I'm guessing your son is too.

44:47.793 --> 44:49.826
- That's my son.

44:52.260 --> 44:53.426
- I was wrong.

44:53.493 --> 44:55.125
- Just give him five minutes
in the game.

44:55.260 --> 44:56.260
Let him prove himself.

44:56.293 --> 44:57.659
- Three minutes
if we're winning.

44:57.725 --> 44:59.292
- Five minutes.
- OK.

44:59.359 --> 45:00.625
You know what?
You drive a tough bargain.

45:00.692 --> 45:03.359
Three it is!
- Coach.

45:03.425 --> 45:05.459
- Four minutes!

45:05.525 --> 45:07.991
Not a second longer.

45:12.090 --> 45:14.591
What about four and 1/2?

45:16.957 --> 45:18.291
- I checked her vitals.

45:18.358 --> 45:21.157
Everything's normal,
at least normal for a woman

45:21.257 --> 45:24.257
who's been dead for 15 years.

45:24.323 --> 45:25.557
- Maybe we should cut her open

45:25.623 --> 45:27.457
and then see
if she's normal inside.

45:27.523 --> 45:29.257
- Not exactly how medical
treatment works.

45:29.290 --> 45:30.556
But thanks for the suggestion.

45:30.622 --> 45:31.856
- How do we know she's OK?

45:31.922 --> 45:35.556
I mean, not just physically
but mentally?

45:35.622 --> 45:37.422
- How do we know
this is Allison?

45:37.489 --> 45:39.256
Hm? Really Allison?

45:39.256 --> 45:41.155
- We don't.

45:41.256 --> 45:43.488
This wasn't exactly part
of the plan.

45:43.555 --> 45:47.588
- Maybe our first step is
simply talking with her.

45:47.655 --> 45:50.288
Since she doesn't appear
to be injured,

45:50.355 --> 45:53.520
we're probably OK
to try waking her up.

45:53.587 --> 45:56.487
- Mom?
- Yeah.

45:56.554 --> 45:58.520
I think she's awake.

46:19.985 --> 46:22.418
- Our sons are trained
to be soldiers,

46:22.485 --> 46:26.485
daughters to be leaders.

46:26.551 --> 46:29.151
- Shapeshifter, lycan,

46:29.252 --> 46:32.751
werewolf,

46:32.817 --> 46:35.916
to me it's just
another dumb animal.

46:55.982 --> 46:57.249
- Allison.

46:57.282 --> 46:59.948
Allison.

47:00.014 --> 47:02.014
Allison?

47:02.081 --> 47:03.714
- Where the hell does
she think she's going?

47:03.781 --> 47:05.281
- She's probably
slightly confused.

47:05.348 --> 47:06.581
- Supposed to be slightly dead.

47:06.648 --> 47:08.980
- Split up.
If you find her, yell.

47:09.847 --> 47:11.548
OK.

47:18.047 --> 47:19.146
- Got her!

47:21.079 --> 47:22.647
Ah.

47:22.712 --> 47:24.247
- Hey, Allison!

47:24.280 --> 47:25.579
You OK?

47:25.646 --> 47:26.979
- Not me, man.

47:27.046 --> 47:29.979
[exciting music]

47:30.045 --> 47:36.978

47:44.245 --> 47:45.678
- Shit.

47:47.144 --> 47:48.710
Hey, Allison, wait!

47:54.244 --> 47:55.843
Whoa!
- [grunting]

48:09.443 --> 48:11.243
Who are you?

48:11.243 --> 48:13.508
- It's me. It's Scott.

48:13.575 --> 48:15.508
- Scott who?

48:15.575 --> 48:18.242
- McCall.

48:18.242 --> 48:19.907
- Where's the alpha?

48:19.974 --> 48:20.741
- You mean?

48:20.807 --> 48:23.141
- Where's Derek Hale?

48:54.605 --> 48:56.472
- Wait!

48:58.404 --> 49:02.238
- Hey.
Allison, she's alive.

49:02.304 --> 49:03.538
She's back.

49:03.604 --> 49:05.070
- She's not the only one.

49:11.070 --> 49:12.337
[indistinct
police radio chatter]

49:12.403 --> 49:15.036
- Levchenko,
did you call the power company?

49:15.102 --> 49:16.337
- I just did.

49:16.403 --> 49:17.902
They said everything
is fine on their end.

49:17.969 --> 49:18.869
- Huh.
- Might be an

49:18.936 --> 49:20.437
electrical issue here.

49:20.502 --> 49:22.002
- Sheriff,
we got another problem

49:22.069 --> 49:23.802
that you might want to handle
first.

49:23.869 --> 49:30.436
- If it's another fire,
I don't want to hear about it.

49:30.502 --> 49:32.468
Of course I want
to hear about it!

49:32.535 --> 49:35.135
Get the hell in here,
both of you!

49:35.235 --> 49:37.635
- 20 minutes ago, two hikers
were headed down the trails

49:37.701 --> 49:39.435
and they spotted smoke.

49:39.501 --> 49:40.867
- We've got another witness
who said

49:40.934 --> 49:42.268
they passed by someone
wearing a heavy black coat,

49:42.335 --> 49:44.567
but couldn't see his face
because of a hood.

49:44.634 --> 49:45.634
- OK.

49:45.700 --> 49:46.800
Levchenko, you're with me.

49:46.867 --> 49:49.033
Hewitt, you're with Parrish.

49:49.099 --> 49:51.766
Let's go.

49:51.833 --> 49:53.699
Is that a new uniform?

50:03.233 --> 50:06.565
[car starting]

50:06.632 --> 50:09.765
[car pulling away]

50:14.232 --> 50:16.532
[light clattering]

50:16.598 --> 50:19.731
[ethereal breathing]

50:27.497 --> 50:30.896
[door shuts]

51:01.927 --> 51:04.827
- How'd you get in here?

51:04.893 --> 51:09.627
- The door was ajar.

51:09.693 --> 51:10.926
- Who are you?

51:10.992 --> 51:14.926
- Someone who knows you

51:14.992 --> 51:17.626
better than you know yourself.

51:17.692 --> 51:19.359
- Hands up where I can see 'em!

51:33.858 --> 51:36.724
- You are kitsune,

51:36.790 --> 51:39.090
but you don't know it.

51:40.624 --> 51:45.724
Your brother, Ekaida,
he knew it,

51:45.790 --> 51:48.424
but he never told you.

51:48.490 --> 51:51.357
- How do you know
about my brother?

51:51.423 --> 51:56.456
- The spirit in you, it's old.

51:56.523 --> 52:00.688
It's drawn to Beacon Hills.

52:00.755 --> 52:03.256
- Don't come any closer!

52:03.323 --> 52:07.022
- The power,

52:07.087 --> 52:09.954
it's like an armor
protecting you.

52:10.021 --> 52:13.654
But it cannot protect you now!

52:18.487 --> 52:19.687
- Ah!

52:22.521 --> 52:24.120
Ah. Oh!

52:24.221 --> 52:26.086
Oh!

52:26.221 --> 52:29.053
- There it is.

52:29.120 --> 52:32.286
I don't want your life,
little fox.

52:32.353 --> 52:34.620
- Oh. Ah.

52:34.685 --> 52:37.885
- But I do want your tail.

52:37.952 --> 52:40.519
You have nine tails

52:40.585 --> 52:42.819
that can summon nine Oni.

52:42.885 --> 52:44.252
- [groaning]

52:44.319 --> 52:46.252
- Now

52:46.319 --> 52:50.384
give them to me!

52:50.451 --> 52:52.251
- Scott.
- Yeah.

52:52.318 --> 52:53.718
- We don't know where she's
going or what she's doing.

52:53.784 --> 52:55.218
- Or how the hell she's alive.

52:55.284 --> 52:57.050
- Well, can we answer that
question after we find her?

52:57.117 --> 52:58.717
- That woman may look
like Allison,

52:58.783 --> 53:00.417
but it doesn't mean
that she is Allison.

53:00.483 --> 53:01.883
- She didn't recognize me.

53:01.950 --> 53:04.283
- Me either.

53:04.350 --> 53:05.317
But she saw me heal.

53:05.383 --> 53:06.850
She knows what I am.

53:06.916 --> 53:09.250
- So she doesn't remember us but
she knows about werewolves.

53:09.317 --> 53:10.949
It's frighteningly convenient
for a werewolf hunter

53:11.016 --> 53:14.116
who just got brought back
to life.

53:14.216 --> 53:16.416
- She also knew how to kick ass,

53:16.482 --> 53:17.749
specifically my ass.

53:17.816 --> 53:19.015
- Hold on.

53:19.081 --> 53:20.649
When I told her
my last name was McCall,

53:20.715 --> 53:22.449
she looked at me like she...

53:22.515 --> 53:23.781
was expecting something else.

53:23.848 --> 53:25.581
- Hale.

53:25.648 --> 53:27.381
But if the only thing
that she remembers right now

53:27.448 --> 53:29.748
is that she hunts
and kills werewolves--

53:29.815 --> 53:31.281
- Then we need to find Derek.

53:31.348 --> 53:32.481
- I'm coming with you.

53:32.548 --> 53:33.980
OK.

53:55.446 --> 53:58.379
- Allison.

54:06.545 --> 54:09.011
[gurgling breaths]

54:13.377 --> 54:14.411
- Who are you?

54:14.477 --> 54:16.976
A friend,

54:17.043 --> 54:21.211
despite appearances.

54:22.810 --> 54:27.776
A friend with a fondness
for...

54:27.842 --> 54:30.675
riddles.

54:30.742 --> 54:32.709
- I don't remember
liking riddles.

54:32.775 --> 54:36.942
- Oh, you'll like this one.

54:37.009 --> 54:41.442
What's another word
for the metal silver,

54:41.509 --> 54:46.041
and also the name
of a legendary family

54:46.108 --> 54:50.708
who hunts werewolves?

54:50.774 --> 54:52.274
- Argent.

54:52.341 --> 54:58.207
- Allison Argent.

54:58.273 --> 55:01.207
Time to hunt.

55:01.273 --> 55:05.839
Time to kill Scott McCall,

55:05.906 --> 55:09.839
the werewolf
who destroyed your family.

55:09.906 --> 55:11.372
- I don't remember that name.

55:11.439 --> 55:14.272
- Oh, you will.

55:14.339 --> 55:16.105
We will help you.

55:16.206 --> 55:17.905
- I don't fucking trust you.

55:17.971 --> 55:19.905
- You would trust your mother,
wouldn't you?

55:24.271 --> 55:27.371
- You're not my mother.

55:27.438 --> 55:29.104
- But aren't I precisely
the voice

55:29.205 --> 55:30.670
you need to hear right now?

55:30.737 --> 55:33.504
- No, my mother's dead.

55:33.570 --> 55:36.737
- No. No.

55:36.804 --> 55:39.036
- That's why I'm here.

55:39.103 --> 55:42.069
- Our side has suffered
so many losses.

55:42.204 --> 55:48.968
Allison, you have to remember
Scott McCall, Derek Hale.

55:49.035 --> 55:51.503
Those men,
those monsters have murdered

55:51.569 --> 55:53.035
so many innocent people.

55:53.102 --> 55:54.835
They have to be stopped.

55:57.202 --> 55:59.967
- What do you want me to do?

56:00.034 --> 56:03.634
- The betas make the alpha
stronger.

56:03.701 --> 56:05.701
- So I take out
the weakest members first?

56:05.767 --> 56:08.634
- Scott McCall has too many
allies right now.

56:08.701 --> 56:10.100
- So how do I get to him?

56:10.201 --> 56:12.966
- The Oni will clear a path.

56:13.033 --> 56:16.301
They will clear the board
of the other pieces,

56:16.367 --> 56:21.233
leaving you to concentrate
on a winning move.

56:21.300 --> 56:23.999
- What's the winning move?

56:24.065 --> 56:27.732
- In the game of Go,

56:27.799 --> 56:29.999
we call it the divine move.

56:39.199 --> 56:40.299
- None of my texts
are going through.

56:40.364 --> 56:42.798
I can't reach...

56:42.864 --> 56:44.997
anyone.

56:45.063 --> 56:47.464
- Do you think that's connected?

56:55.897 --> 56:57.397
Oh!

57:01.230 --> 57:03.297
- Someone was killed here.

57:03.363 --> 57:04.929
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure
a lot of people

57:04.996 --> 57:06.096
have been killed here, Lydia.

57:06.196 --> 57:07.662
- Recently.

57:09.762 --> 57:12.028
- Are we gonna be killed here?

[tense music]

57:23.428 --> 57:27.494
Please tell me that
Allison didn't do that.

57:27.560 --> 57:29.794
- Dad, put me down!

57:29.860 --> 57:30.894
Please put me down.

57:30.960 --> 57:32.360
- You said you couldn't walk.

57:32.427 --> 57:33.594
- I can hop.

57:41.759 --> 57:42.958
Ow.

57:43.025 --> 57:44.193
- You almost had that shot.

57:44.226 --> 57:45.659
- No, I didn't.

57:45.725 --> 57:48.226
- Yes, you did. I saw it.
You were right at the goal.

57:48.293 --> 57:50.058
You're better than
you think you are.

57:50.193 --> 57:51.592
- I was in
for less than a minute.

57:51.658 --> 57:53.825
I got the ball for a second
and I got knocked on my ass

57:53.892 --> 57:55.924
and I twisted my ankle.

57:55.991 --> 57:57.891
It wasn't anything.
- Eli.

57:57.957 --> 57:58.991
- It was nothing.

57:59.057 --> 58:00.392
- It was something.

58:02.691 --> 58:06.191
I was watching Coach
and he saw it too.

58:06.257 --> 58:07.624
You're good.

58:07.691 --> 58:10.023
You're really good.

58:10.090 --> 58:12.723
And...if you can heal,

58:12.790 --> 58:14.390
you can play tomorrow night,

58:14.456 --> 58:17.356
and you can help them win.

58:17.423 --> 58:20.656
The first step to transforming
is healing,

58:20.722 --> 58:22.722
but you've got to be
willing to learn.

58:24.722 --> 58:26.355
- Ah.

58:31.522 --> 58:32.754
- Get down!

58:32.821 --> 58:34.721
Run! Run!

1:00:17.513 --> 1:00:18.879
- Derek, he's not here.

1:00:18.945 --> 1:00:20.812
- He was.

1:00:20.879 --> 1:00:22.145
He knows what to do.

1:00:22.212 --> 1:00:24.978
We--we have a plan.

1:00:25.044 --> 1:00:26.878
He has the--

1:00:26.944 --> 1:00:28.445
he has the car.

- Don't--don't try to talk.

1:00:30.145 --> 1:00:34.278
- Eli, he'll go to the shop.

1:00:34.344 --> 1:00:36.744
He knows what to do.
He knows what to do.

1:00:36.811 --> 1:00:39.977
- Don't talk.

1:00:40.043 --> 1:00:42.043
Hey, hey!

1:00:42.110 --> 1:00:43.244
- Scott.
- What?

1:00:43.310 --> 1:00:45.377
- It's not just Allison.

1:00:45.443 --> 1:00:48.443
- It's the Oni. It's Nogitsune.
- They're coming.

1:00:55.009 --> 1:00:57.776
- Scott, what do we do?

1:01:04.541 --> 1:01:07.741
- Liam, get to Stilinski,
find Lydia,

1:01:07.808 --> 1:01:09.408
and tell them
we need their help.

1:01:09.475 --> 1:01:12.007
Tell them we need everyone.

1:01:12.074 --> 1:01:13.341
Malia, let's get him
out of here.

1:01:24.006 --> 1:01:25.174
- It looks like the radius

1:01:25.207 --> 1:01:27.174
is about the same
as the previous fires.

1:01:27.240 --> 1:01:28.307
- Take the others
and see if you can find

1:01:28.374 --> 1:01:31.206
any kind of incendiary device.

1:01:31.273 --> 1:01:35.206
- Parrish.

1:01:35.273 --> 1:01:37.805
What's your take on this?

1:01:37.872 --> 1:01:39.838
- Are you asking me
as a deputy or?

1:01:39.905 --> 1:01:42.338
- As someone who's known to
set himself on fire

1:01:42.405 --> 1:01:44.372
because he's a demon called
a hellhound?

1:01:44.438 --> 1:01:46.172
- Yeah, but I'm a nice demon.

1:01:46.205 --> 1:01:48.671
- Given.

1:01:48.737 --> 1:01:50.971
Who set these fires?

1:01:51.037 --> 1:01:53.037
- Not an arsonist.
- Yeah.

1:01:53.172 --> 1:01:56.337
A serial arsonist would want
to watch the fire burn,

1:01:56.404 --> 1:01:59.171
not have it snuffed out
minutes after ignition.

1:01:59.204 --> 1:02:02.337
And plus they typically have
an emotional cooling off period,

1:02:02.404 --> 1:02:03.370
and--
- These are being set

1:02:03.436 --> 1:02:04.770
one after another.

1:02:04.836 --> 1:02:06.536
And all that says one thing,
that these fires--

1:02:06.603 --> 1:02:09.470
- Are not about fire.

1:02:10.703 --> 1:02:12.303
- Go see what you can dig up.

1:02:12.370 --> 1:02:14.702
I'm gonna call our consultant.

1:03:22.397 --> 1:03:24.164

1:03:24.230 --> 1:03:25.296
But we have to help you first.

1:03:25.363 --> 1:03:27.263
- No. No, Eli.

1:03:27.329 --> 1:03:30.496
His ankle, he twisted it.
He can't run.

1:03:30.563 --> 1:03:31.795
- But he can heal.

1:03:31.862 --> 1:03:33.562
- No, he won't.
- Eli can't heal,

1:03:33.628 --> 1:03:35.795
not like a werewolf, not yet.

1:03:35.862 --> 1:03:37.295
- What's wrong with him?

1:03:37.362 --> 1:03:39.428
- You know how some people
pass out when they see a needle?

1:03:39.495 --> 1:03:40.862
Eli passes out when
he sees his own fangs.

1:03:40.927 --> 1:03:42.162
- He passes out?

1:03:42.228 --> 1:03:43.761
- The fangs come out.
- He's on the floor.

1:03:43.827 --> 1:03:46.027
Claws too.

1:03:46.162 --> 1:03:49.195
- Scott, you have to find him.

1:03:49.261 --> 1:03:51.993
You have to find him before
she does.

1:04:20.392 --> 1:04:21.624
- Sheriff!

1:04:25.791 --> 1:04:27.458
Sheriff!

1:04:29.291 --> 1:04:32.191
Where are you?

1:04:32.258 --> 1:04:33.923
- Mason?

1:04:33.990 --> 1:04:36.057
Mason, help.

1:04:37.890 --> 1:04:38.757
Help.

1:04:38.823 --> 1:04:40.690
[blade slicing]
Ah!

1:04:44.956 --> 1:04:46.689
- [screams]

1:04:51.456 --> 1:04:54.788
- [grunting]

1:04:57.321 --> 1:04:58.688
- Sheriff.

1:05:00.255 --> 1:05:01.555
- No!

1:05:08.387 --> 1:05:09.620
Aw, shit.

1:05:09.687 --> 1:05:12.820
[dramatic music]

1:05:12.887 --> 1:05:19.819
* *

1:05:27.286 --> 1:05:28.818
[bullet ricochets]

1:05:34.818 --> 1:05:35.984
- Go!

1:05:37.318 --> 1:05:39.152
[screams]

1:05:39.452 --> 1:05:41.385
- All right. Come on.

1:05:44.351 --> 1:05:45.384
- Easy.

1:05:45.451 --> 1:05:47.016
- Here.

1:05:47.151 --> 1:05:49.217
- Easy. Easy.

1:05:49.284 --> 1:05:50.417
- You have to find Eli.

1:05:50.484 --> 1:05:51.584
Eli.

1:05:51.650 --> 1:05:53.151
You have to find Eli.

1:05:55.650 --> 1:05:59.216
Derek, you're gonna need to
let Scott and the others

1:05:59.283 --> 1:06:00.316
take care of it, OK?

1:06:00.383 --> 1:06:01.949
Anyone that loses
this much blood,

1:06:02.015 --> 1:06:03.283
human or werewolf,

1:06:03.350 --> 1:06:05.415
you're not gonna be any good
to anyone else.

1:06:05.482 --> 1:06:06.749
- We need a lighter.

1:06:06.815 --> 1:06:08.715
The healing process
works faster with fire.

1:06:11.914 --> 1:06:15.848
- I've been known to light
a spark or two in my time.

1:06:26.481 --> 1:06:29.047
[chuckles]

1:06:29.148 --> 1:06:31.447
- Peter, no.

1:06:31.513 --> 1:06:34.713
[screams]

1:06:51.246 --> 1:06:52.878
- Do I need to remind you people

1:06:52.945 --> 1:06:56.044
that he slashed my throat once
and it killed me?

1:06:56.145 --> 1:06:58.478
- When it comes to you,
most of us try to forget.

1:06:58.545 --> 1:07:01.544
- That is no way to speak
to your father.

1:07:01.610 --> 1:07:03.211
- Look,
we're running out of time.

1:07:03.278 --> 1:07:04.610
We've got to catch up to Eli.

1:07:04.677 --> 1:07:06.744
- You mean before Allison does.

1:07:08.510 --> 1:07:09.976
Allison Argent,
back from the dead,

1:07:10.043 --> 1:07:11.477
running around,
shooting up werewolves

1:07:11.544 --> 1:07:12.809
like a good little hunter?

1:07:12.876 --> 1:07:14.876
You must be so proud.

1:07:16.443 --> 1:07:19.243
- Can we just lower the level
of the testosterone

1:07:19.309 --> 1:07:21.808
in the room, fellas? Huh?

1:07:21.875 --> 1:07:22.942
- Derek said that
they had a plan

1:07:23.008 --> 1:07:24.143
for when something like this
happens.

1:07:24.209 --> 1:07:25.775
- The auto shop.

1:07:25.842 --> 1:07:27.775
That's where they'll go.

1:07:27.842 --> 1:07:28.908
Emergency rendezvous point.

1:07:28.975 --> 1:07:30.142
How far behind was Allison?

1:07:30.175 --> 1:07:31.808
- Not far enough.
- I'm coming with you.

1:07:31.875 --> 1:07:34.941
- No. You need to find Lydia.

1:07:35.007 --> 1:07:36.741
Liam and Hikari are already
looking for Stilinski,

1:07:36.807 --> 1:07:38.342
but honestly, if there's anyone
who could figure

1:07:38.407 --> 1:07:40.007
this thing out, it's Lydia.

1:07:40.142 --> 1:07:41.907
Find Lydia.
I'll get Eli.

1:07:41.974 --> 1:07:43.141
- Wait.
- I gotta go.

1:07:43.174 --> 1:07:44.507
- Wait!

1:07:44.574 --> 1:07:46.640
Scott, wait, wait.
- What, Mom? What?

1:07:48.940 --> 1:07:50.606
- If there's some small chance
that it's her,

1:07:50.673 --> 1:07:53.373
that it's really Allison--

1:07:53.440 --> 1:07:55.573
- It can't be, right?

1:07:55.640 --> 1:07:57.173
It's impossible.

1:07:57.240 --> 1:07:58.573
- Listen to me.

1:07:58.639 --> 1:08:00.905
If I've learned anything
living in Beacon Hills,

1:08:00.972 --> 1:08:02.905
it's that every time someone
says something's impossible,

1:08:02.972 --> 1:08:05.705
somehow the impossible
seems to happen.

1:08:05.772 --> 1:08:06.839
If you think it's really her,

1:08:06.904 --> 1:08:09.205
you have to find her
and stop her

1:08:09.272 --> 1:08:12.671
and help her remember
who she was.

1:08:12.738 --> 1:08:14.971
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you too.

1:08:17.604 --> 1:08:19.937
Go get her.

1:08:25.204 --> 1:08:28.137
[thunder claps]

1:08:48.136 --> 1:08:49.568
- Come on.

1:09:10.466 --> 1:09:12.233
[keys clatter]

1:09:58.729 --> 1:10:00.295
- What do you smell?

1:10:05.095 --> 1:10:06.728
- Fear.

1:10:06.794 --> 1:10:08.628
- That would be me.

1:10:11.694 --> 1:10:13.228
- You're gonna want to see this.

1:10:17.860 --> 1:10:20.060
- He was a kitsune,

1:10:20.128 --> 1:10:22.560
probably didn't even know it.

1:10:22.627 --> 1:10:23.893
If the Nogitsune murdered him,

1:10:23.960 --> 1:10:26.059
then he did it
to steal his tails.

1:10:26.127 --> 1:10:28.360
- The tails only get him
one thing:

1:10:28.427 --> 1:10:29.892
the Oni.

1:10:29.959 --> 1:10:31.059
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:10:31.127 --> 1:10:32.826
I have a tail.

1:10:32.892 --> 1:10:34.826
No one's planning on
stealing my tail, right?

1:10:34.892 --> 1:10:37.359
- Will you please shut up?

1:10:37.426 --> 1:10:40.625
There's more going on and
I think it's all connected.

1:10:40.691 --> 1:10:44.159
- More what?

1:10:44.226 --> 1:10:46.791
- Well, someone's
been setting fires.

1:10:46.858 --> 1:10:48.358
- If Allison catches up to Eli,

1:10:48.425 --> 1:10:49.725
we might need
some real medical attention,

1:10:49.790 --> 1:10:51.458
not just a blow torch.

1:10:51.525 --> 1:10:54.225
- I feel like that
was aimed at me.

1:10:54.291 --> 1:10:56.424
- Get out of the way or
there'll be a gun aimed at you.

1:10:56.490 --> 1:10:57.624
- Of course.

1:10:57.690 --> 1:11:01.190
Just satisfy my curiosity
about one thing.

1:11:01.257 --> 1:11:03.656
Who are you going out there
to help,

1:11:03.723 --> 1:11:06.823
her or him,
predator or prey?

1:11:06.889 --> 1:11:10.223
- I'll stop anyone who tries to
kill an innocent 15-year-old.

1:11:10.289 --> 1:11:11.955
- And yet you look like
a man with doubts.

1:11:12.022 --> 1:11:13.256
Let's ask the expert.

1:11:13.323 --> 1:11:15.256
Mr. Deaton?

1:11:18.755 --> 1:11:20.255
- The Nogitsune is
an extraordinarily

1:11:20.322 --> 1:11:21.555
powerful creature.

1:11:21.622 --> 1:11:23.188
It can create illusions

1:11:23.255 --> 1:11:25.555
that are nearly
indistinguishable from reality.

1:11:25.622 --> 1:11:27.122
- Illusion.

1:11:27.155 --> 1:11:29.921
- But that illusion today,

1:11:29.987 --> 1:11:32.954
that looked pretty damn real
to me.

1:11:34.421 --> 1:11:35.521
- Me too.

1:11:35.587 --> 1:11:36.953
- I know what I saw.

1:11:43.353 --> 1:11:46.353
I saw an exact replica,

1:11:46.420 --> 1:11:50.353
meant to trick us
into lowering our guard.

1:11:50.420 --> 1:11:52.485
My daughter is gone.

1:11:52.552 --> 1:11:58.185
Whoever or whatever is out there
isn't Allison.

1:11:58.252 --> 1:11:59.884
It's an illusion.

1:11:59.951 --> 1:12:03.018
- Then I say,
let's dispel the illusion.

1:12:12.351 --> 1:12:15.318
- [panting]

1:12:25.882 --> 1:12:27.982
[metal scrapes]

1:13:07.379 --> 1:13:08.812
[creaking]

1:13:36.244 --> 1:13:39.176
[grunting]

1:13:55.542 --> 1:13:56.841
- Allison, stop!

1:14:01.974 --> 1:14:05.541
Come on! Come on!
Go, go, go, go!

1:14:05.608 --> 1:14:07.807
Ah!
- Oh, shit.

1:14:07.873 --> 1:14:09.374
OK. Go.

1:14:12.373 --> 1:14:13.973
Oh! Ah, come on!

1:14:14.107 --> 1:14:15.307
Come on! Let's go!
- OK. OK.

1:14:15.373 --> 1:14:17.107
- I know you don't
remember everything,

1:14:17.173 --> 1:14:18.607
but if you stop trying to
kill us for half a second,

1:14:18.672 --> 1:14:20.107
I could help you remember!

1:14:24.806 --> 1:14:26.839
Come on! All right! Hey!

1:14:26.906 --> 1:14:28.106
We're gonna have to run.

1:14:28.106 --> 1:14:29.672
I need you to heal.
- I can't.

1:14:29.738 --> 1:14:31.106
I can't heal. I can't transform.

1:14:31.139 --> 1:14:32.272
I can't do any of it.

1:14:32.339 --> 1:14:34.139
- Well, you're gonna learn
right now.

1:14:35.271 --> 1:14:36.438
- How?

1:14:36.505 --> 1:14:38.338
- Like this.

1:14:38.405 --> 1:14:41.571
[roaring]

1:14:41.638 --> 1:14:43.570
[high-pitched ringing]

1:14:51.570 --> 1:14:53.537
[sirens wailing]

1:14:58.569 --> 1:15:01.403
- We've got multiple calls
about a fire.

1:15:01.469 --> 1:15:03.103
- Copy, Dispatch.
We're en route now.

1:15:03.103 --> 1:15:06.602
Parrish, go to two.

1:15:06.668 --> 1:15:08.602
- I'll hit the station.

1:15:08.668 --> 1:15:10.103
But, Sheriff,

1:15:10.136 --> 1:15:13.001
Mason, he just--he vanished.

1:15:13.102 --> 1:15:15.402
- We don't know
what happened to him yet.

1:15:15.468 --> 1:15:18.001
Right now,
I need you at the station.

1:15:18.102 --> 1:15:19.135
I'll check Hale Auto.

1:15:19.202 --> 1:15:21.434
You copy me?

1:15:21.501 --> 1:15:23.101
- Copy, sir.

1:15:27.167 --> 1:15:30.201
- Come on, Eli! Don't stop!
She's right behind us.

1:15:31.933 --> 1:15:33.933
Come on, keep going.

1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:35.100
Kid, come on, get up, get up!

1:15:35.133 --> 1:15:38.466
Go, go, go! Right there, go!

1:15:42.499 --> 1:15:45.133
Listen, you're gonna have to
keep going on without me.

1:15:45.199 --> 1:15:46.365
- Wait, what are you
talking about?

1:15:46.432 --> 1:15:47.699
- I have to try to
get through to her.

1:15:47.765 --> 1:15:50.599
- She's trying to get
an arrow through you.

1:15:50.665 --> 1:15:52.099
- [groaning]

1:15:55.664 --> 1:15:57.464
- What is that?

1:15:57.531 --> 1:15:59.198
- Wolfsbane.

1:15:59.264 --> 1:16:00.997
She coated the arrowheads
in wolfsbane.

1:16:01.098 --> 1:16:02.897
- My dad told me you almost
had to cut his arm off once

1:16:02.963 --> 1:16:04.997
because of wolfsbane poisoning.

1:16:05.098 --> 1:16:06.463
- You need to run, Eli.

1:16:06.530 --> 1:16:08.563
We're not far from the road.
I--I'll keep her busy.

1:16:08.630 --> 1:16:11.929
- I can't. OK?
I can't do it without you.

1:16:11.996 --> 1:16:14.297
- Hey, you're gonna be
all right, OK?

1:16:14.363 --> 1:16:15.629
Remember, you just learned
how to heal.

1:16:15.696 --> 1:16:16.762
- You did that for me.

1:16:16.829 --> 1:16:18.596
- I gave you a push.

1:16:18.662 --> 1:16:21.429
And if Allison has any chance
of remembering who she is,

1:16:21.496 --> 1:16:23.961
she's gonna need the same push.

1:16:24.096 --> 1:16:25.262
Find your dad.

1:16:25.329 --> 1:16:26.562
I think I'm gonna need his help.

1:16:26.628 --> 1:16:29.096
- Yeah, OK.

1:16:33.395 --> 1:16:35.095
- Yeah, the fires all happened

1:16:35.161 --> 1:16:37.960
right after the jar
was taken from Japan.

1:16:38.095 --> 1:16:40.161
- Liam, that's him.

1:16:40.228 --> 1:16:41.195
- That's the guy
who stole the jar,

1:16:41.261 --> 1:16:43.160
the one who freed the Nogitsune.

1:16:43.227 --> 1:16:44.827
- He's the one
setting the fires.

1:16:44.894 --> 1:16:46.859
- And not the Nogitsune?

1:16:46.926 --> 1:16:49.260
Why don't we catch him
and kill the Nogitsune?

1:16:49.327 --> 1:16:50.593
That sounds like
a pretty good plan to me.

1:16:50.659 --> 1:16:52.493
- Well, the Nogitsune's
not a person.

1:16:52.559 --> 1:16:56.459
It's an ancient power, so old
it's practically elemental.

1:16:56.526 --> 1:16:58.293
It might not be possible
to kill him.

1:16:58.359 --> 1:17:00.758
- Well, I'm willing
to give it a shot.

1:17:00.825 --> 1:17:03.492
- We're wasting time.

1:17:03.558 --> 1:17:05.093
You guys can figure out
who's starting the fire.

1:17:05.159 --> 1:17:06.825
We need to find Scott.

1:17:12.358 --> 1:17:15.724
- [shouts]
[tires screeching]

1:17:25.723 --> 1:17:29.091
- She drove this one,
smashed right into Derek's.

1:17:29.157 --> 1:17:30.790
[sniffing]

1:17:30.856 --> 1:17:32.190
- You smell something else?

1:17:32.256 --> 1:17:34.855
- [sniffing]

1:17:34.922 --> 1:17:37.090
Anger.

1:17:37.123 --> 1:17:39.422
The air, it's rife
with a homicidal rage.

1:17:39.489 --> 1:17:41.389
She certainly has the anger
of an Argent.

1:17:41.455 --> 1:17:44.189
- Then it's more proof
it's not Allison.

1:17:44.255 --> 1:17:46.222
My daughter wouldn't kill
a 15-year-old boy.

1:17:46.289 --> 1:17:47.821
- You had the Nogitsune
in your head.

1:17:47.888 --> 1:17:48.988
Maybe it's in hers.

1:17:49.089 --> 1:17:50.222
- If there's room enough,

1:17:50.289 --> 1:17:52.089
with all of that
unadulterated fury.

1:17:52.089 --> 1:17:54.654
- Not everybody has your anger.

1:17:54.721 --> 1:17:56.488
- Not everyone
has your optimism.

1:17:56.554 --> 1:17:58.554
Don't underestimate anger,
Melissa.

1:17:58.620 --> 1:18:00.354
We all have the same instinct
for fight or flight.

1:18:00.421 --> 1:18:04.787
Flight begins with fear
but fight is born of anger.

1:18:04.853 --> 1:18:06.353
- She put an arrow
into his truck.

1:18:06.420 --> 1:18:09.453
They're on the run, that way.

1:18:09.520 --> 1:18:10.952
- Can you track 'em
through the woods?

1:18:11.087 --> 1:18:12.519
both: Yes.

1:18:20.785 --> 1:18:22.519
- Allison, stop!

1:18:26.186 --> 1:18:27.351
[grunts]

1:18:38.085 --> 1:18:40.184
I want to talk.

1:18:41.117 --> 1:18:42.750
- Sure, let's talk.

1:18:46.184 --> 1:18:47.716
- Dad? Dad?

1:18:47.783 --> 1:18:48.983
- Eli?

1:18:49.084 --> 1:18:50.483
Eli!

1:18:53.683 --> 1:18:54.882
You're safe, Eli.

1:18:54.948 --> 1:18:56.383
You're safe.

1:18:56.449 --> 1:18:57.982
- Yeah, but Scott isn't.

1:18:58.083 --> 1:19:00.149
- Hey, we got a problem.

1:19:00.216 --> 1:19:01.882
[faint clicking]

1:19:01.948 --> 1:19:03.215
- Three of them.

1:19:06.182 --> 1:19:08.182
[eerie clicking]

1:19:13.082 --> 1:19:18.514
[air hissing]

1:19:18.581 --> 1:19:20.580
- It was done by a sword.

1:19:20.646 --> 1:19:22.646
[eerie clicking]

1:19:26.280 --> 1:19:28.413
- [roars]

1:19:30.280 --> 1:19:31.779
- [screeching]

1:19:34.246 --> 1:19:36.146
- [growling]

1:19:36.212 --> 1:19:39.145
[exciting music]

1:19:39.212 --> 1:19:46.344
* *

1:19:54.144 --> 1:19:56.543
[blades ringing]

1:19:59.310 --> 1:20:01.810
- [grunts]

1:20:13.042 --> 1:20:13.975
[blades slices]

1:20:14.042 --> 1:20:15.376
- Hikari!

1:20:15.442 --> 1:20:17.242
[blade slices]
[snarls]

1:20:22.741 --> 1:20:25.675
[somber music]

1:20:35.774 --> 1:20:37.640

1:20:39.274 --> 1:20:40.873

- [gasps]

1:20:45.040 --> 1:20:49.673

1:20:49.739 --> 1:20:52.306
- [grunting]

1:20:57.638 --> 1:20:58.838
- Dad!

1:21:00.272 --> 1:21:01.738
- [grunts]

1:21:07.105 --> 1:21:10.804
[electrical buzzing]

1:21:16.503 --> 1:21:18.670
- [screams]
- Oh, no!

1:21:21.203 --> 1:21:22.570
- Deaton!

1:21:29.835 --> 1:21:33.269
- [grunts]
[glass shattering]

1:21:33.335 --> 1:21:35.069
[roars]

1:21:37.102 --> 1:21:38.135
- Dad--

1:21:38.202 --> 1:21:39.901
[blade slices]

1:21:39.968 --> 1:21:42.234
- [gasps]

1:21:42.301 --> 1:21:47.568
- [labored breathing]

1:21:47.634 --> 1:21:49.800
Remember who you are.

1:21:52.733 --> 1:21:54.667
[blade slices]

1:21:58.167 --> 1:22:01.333
- Malia?
- Come on. Come on!

1:22:03.067 --> 1:22:08.299
[both grunting]

1:22:09.399 --> 1:22:12.366
[both grunting]

1:22:13.798 --> 1:22:15.531
- Allison, if you just
give me one second,

1:22:15.598 --> 1:22:17.765
I can tell you the truth.
- You killed half my family.

1:22:17.831 --> 1:22:20.631
- I never killed anyone,
and neither did you.

1:22:20.698 --> 1:22:21.798
[grunts]

1:22:23.231 --> 1:22:25.597
[gasping]

1:22:25.664 --> 1:22:28.930
I know those daggers
have wolfsbane on them.

1:22:29.065 --> 1:22:31.064
And I know you think you're
gonna go through with it.

1:22:31.097 --> 1:22:34.464
- [grunts]

1:22:34.530 --> 1:22:36.330
- Because that's what
the Nogitsune wants.

1:22:36.397 --> 1:22:40.064
He wants me to die
in your arms this time.

1:22:40.064 --> 1:22:42.063
Are you ready for that?

1:22:42.129 --> 1:22:44.096
Because it's not easy.

1:22:44.629 --> 1:22:47.329
- [groans]
- Come on.

1:22:53.063 --> 1:22:54.662
[snarls]

1:22:54.728 --> 1:22:57.095
- Eli, what are you doing?

1:22:57.162 --> 1:22:59.062
- I can do this.
- Oh, shit!

1:23:01.394 --> 1:23:03.062
[roars]
- No!

1:23:03.062 --> 1:23:04.794
[blade slices]

1:23:11.893 --> 1:23:17.393
[panting]

1:23:19.193 --> 1:23:20.892
Eli.

1:23:25.459 --> 1:23:26.925
- Whoa, OK, stop!

1:23:27.060 --> 1:23:29.525
What's it gonna take to
get you to stop and listen?

1:23:29.592 --> 1:23:34.624
[wind whooshing]

1:23:38.524 --> 1:23:40.058
[blade slices]

1:23:40.124 --> 1:23:42.191
- [gasping]

1:23:42.258 --> 1:23:44.091
- [grunts]

1:23:55.090 --> 1:23:57.257
OK, you killed me.

1:23:57.323 --> 1:23:58.956
Now can we talk?

1:23:59.057 --> 1:24:01.922
- Why is the guy who went to
Japan to free the Nogitsune

1:24:02.057 --> 1:24:03.856
now in Beacon Hills trying
to burn down the woods?

1:24:03.922 --> 1:24:05.256
- He's not trying to
burn down the woods.

1:24:05.322 --> 1:24:08.855
It's...only part of it.

1:24:08.921 --> 1:24:10.721
- Do we have to play
junior detectives?

1:24:10.788 --> 1:24:13.089
Can't we just leave it up
to the actual detectives?

1:24:13.156 --> 1:24:15.488
- Do you see any actual
detectives standing around?

1:24:18.887 --> 1:24:21.620
- But what do detectives do,
anyway?

1:24:21.687 --> 1:24:24.254
Do they, like, go to
the scene of the crime and...

1:24:24.320 --> 1:24:26.587
detect something?

1:24:28.620 --> 1:24:30.919
- That's exactly what they do.
- [crunches]

1:24:31.054 --> 1:24:33.320
- We need to look at
one of the burn sites,

1:24:33.387 --> 1:24:35.319
the first one.

1:24:35.386 --> 1:24:36.919
- Guys, guys.

1:24:37.054 --> 1:24:38.386
Hi.

1:24:38.453 --> 1:24:40.119
We got a big-ass problem.

1:24:40.186 --> 1:24:43.585
Derek, Stilinski, Eli, Deaton,
they're all gone.

1:24:43.652 --> 1:24:44.652
- What do you mean gone?

1:24:44.718 --> 1:24:46.186
- They were taken.

1:24:46.253 --> 1:24:47.852
- By who?

1:24:48.918 --> 1:24:50.552
- The Oni.

1:24:51.618 --> 1:24:54.951
- [sniffing]

1:25:00.484 --> 1:25:03.384
There's blood...

1:25:03.451 --> 1:25:05.950
all around here,
and a lot.

1:25:06.051 --> 1:25:08.051
- If she managed to cut him
with her ring dagger

1:25:08.117 --> 1:25:09.716
then he's in trouble.

1:25:09.783 --> 1:25:11.283
They're laced with wolfsbane.

1:25:11.350 --> 1:25:12.716
- How long does he have?

1:25:12.783 --> 1:25:15.216
- Six, eight hours at most.

1:25:23.849 --> 1:25:25.715
- These rapid burns...

1:25:29.848 --> 1:25:32.748
There is something
systematic about it.

1:25:32.814 --> 1:25:34.414
- Is she gonna keep
talking like this?

1:25:34.481 --> 1:25:37.148
- I stopped listening
six hours ago.

1:25:37.214 --> 1:25:38.681
- All right. I'm sorry.

1:25:38.747 --> 1:25:39.713
I'm not gonna spend
the rest of the day

1:25:39.780 --> 1:25:40.713
walking through the woods,

1:25:40.780 --> 1:25:42.447
trying to catch a pyromaniac.

1:25:42.513 --> 1:25:43.913
- Do you have a better plan?

1:25:44.048 --> 1:25:45.947
- We already know
what kills the Oni.

1:25:46.048 --> 1:25:47.580
- Silver.

1:25:47.647 --> 1:25:48.946
- You with me?

1:25:49.047 --> 1:25:50.680
- Go.
Get all the silver you can.

1:25:50.746 --> 1:25:52.846
And if you find the Oni,
don't fight them, kill them.

1:26:10.845 --> 1:26:13.145
- We're heading back to
the main road, aren't we?

1:26:13.211 --> 1:26:15.777
[grunts]

1:26:15.844 --> 1:26:19.677
And my blood,
it's going to lure them.

1:26:19.744 --> 1:26:21.877
I'm the bait for
the trap, right?

1:26:21.944 --> 1:26:24.077
[winces]

1:26:24.144 --> 1:26:27.809
'Cause by the time the others
catch up to us, I'll be dead,

1:26:27.876 --> 1:26:29.244
and you can pick the others
off one by one.

1:26:29.310 --> 1:26:31.543
Is that the plan?

1:26:31.609 --> 1:26:33.309
- Yeah, actually.
That is the plan.

1:26:35.808 --> 1:26:37.875
- You don't hunt werewolves,
Allison.

1:26:37.942 --> 1:26:40.343
And no matter what the Nogitsune
put into your head,

1:26:40.408 --> 1:26:42.442
you don't kill them either.

1:26:42.508 --> 1:26:43.875
And I think part of you
knows it.

1:26:43.942 --> 1:26:46.075
I saw it the moment
you stabbed me.

1:26:46.142 --> 1:26:48.874
- Saw what?

1:26:48.941 --> 1:26:50.042
- Regret.

1:26:53.108 --> 1:26:55.607
- Go.

1:26:58.906 --> 1:27:02.606
- Jackson, what do you smell?

1:27:02.673 --> 1:27:04.573
- Ugh. The horrifying
stench of death.

1:27:04.640 --> 1:27:06.740
- What else do you smell?

1:27:11.173 --> 1:27:13.173
- It's not gas.

1:27:13.240 --> 1:27:16.140
It's not lighter fluid
or anything like that.

1:27:16.206 --> 1:27:17.739
It's different.

1:27:17.805 --> 1:27:20.372
- Chemical accelerant.

1:27:20.439 --> 1:27:22.039
Mm-hmm. It's a quick burn

1:27:22.105 --> 1:27:24.671
so they can't set
the rest of the forest on fire.

1:27:24.738 --> 1:27:27.072
- Well, does that tell us
anything useful?

1:27:27.139 --> 1:27:31.204
- Well, in terms of the fire,
they know chemicals.

1:27:34.571 --> 1:27:36.603
They know exactly
how to use them.

1:27:36.670 --> 1:27:38.304
- I don't get it.
Why would someone

1:27:38.371 --> 1:27:41.737
spend all this time and energy
burning up rowan trees?

1:27:41.803 --> 1:27:43.270
- Rowan trees?
- Yeah.

1:27:43.337 --> 1:27:45.037
That's what the smell is, right?

1:27:45.037 --> 1:27:46.337
- Jackson, do you know
what rowan trees become

1:27:46.403 --> 1:27:47.602
after they're burned?

1:27:47.669 --> 1:27:49.802
- Ash?

1:27:53.436 --> 1:27:55.336
- Mountain ash.

1:28:02.036 --> 1:28:04.901
- You're not gonna kill me.

1:28:05.036 --> 1:28:09.235
- That's right. The wolfsbane is
going to kill you.

1:28:09.301 --> 1:28:10.700
- You had a code.

1:28:10.767 --> 1:28:12.068
- Mm-hmm.

1:28:12.135 --> 1:28:13.434
"We hunt those who hunt us."

1:28:13.500 --> 1:28:16.734
- No.

1:28:16.800 --> 1:28:19.667
You came up with a new one.

1:28:19.734 --> 1:28:23.866
"We protect--"
- "We protect those who...

1:28:23.933 --> 1:28:26.599
cannot protect themselves."

1:28:26.666 --> 1:28:28.766
- You remember.

1:28:44.032 --> 1:28:46.265
- We should grab
whatever we can.

1:28:51.631 --> 1:28:53.697
- I'm taking this.

1:28:57.197 --> 1:28:58.496
- Don't worry.
It's not the look.

1:28:58.563 --> 1:29:00.330
It's more of a...

1:29:00.396 --> 1:29:03.230
"you look really hot holding
a tactical tomahawk" look.

1:29:10.695 --> 1:29:14.195
- If we don't die tonight,
we can talk about it.

1:29:14.262 --> 1:29:15.429
- Huh.

1:29:15.495 --> 1:29:18.129
Then I'm definitely not
dying tonight.

1:29:19.928 --> 1:29:23.461
- [labored breathing]

1:29:43.427 --> 1:29:46.559
- Scott.

1:29:46.626 --> 1:29:48.159
- Yes, he's handsome.

1:29:48.226 --> 1:29:50.859
History is replete
with handsome killers.

1:29:50.925 --> 1:29:52.526
He's still a killer.

1:29:52.592 --> 1:29:53.825
- What am I even doing here?

1:29:53.891 --> 1:29:56.491
This--this can't be
the right thing to do.

1:29:56.558 --> 1:29:59.391
- Don't get lost in useless
moral quandaries, Allison.

1:29:59.458 --> 1:30:01.025
Stick to the plan.

1:30:01.091 --> 1:30:03.091
Your father is on his way here
right now.

1:30:03.158 --> 1:30:05.391
- I saw him at the hospital.
That was him.

1:30:05.458 --> 1:30:09.991
- No, he's on his way and
he's bringing Peter Hale.

1:30:10.058 --> 1:30:12.025
You remember what
that monster did to Kate?

1:30:12.090 --> 1:30:14.923
He ripped her throat out
with his claws.

1:30:14.990 --> 1:30:17.290
He'll do the same to you
if he gets the chance.

1:30:17.357 --> 1:30:19.789
Don't you remember
how they burned us?

1:30:19.856 --> 1:30:22.256
We lost years.

1:30:22.323 --> 1:30:27.955
Can't you feel that life
stolen from you?

1:30:28.023 --> 1:30:29.423
- I don't know what I feel!

1:30:29.489 --> 1:30:31.323
- A few more hours
and the sun goes down.

1:30:31.388 --> 1:30:33.522
We'll take care
of everything then.

1:30:33.588 --> 1:30:35.922
They come out at night.

1:30:35.989 --> 1:30:39.055
- Who?
- The Oni.

1:30:39.122 --> 1:30:43.787
And with them comes chaos.

1:30:43.854 --> 1:30:46.754
[unsettling music]

1:30:46.821 --> 1:30:48.287
* *

1:30:52.187 --> 1:30:54.354
- Eli.

1:30:54.420 --> 1:30:56.386
Eli, can you hear me?

1:31:07.220 --> 1:31:09.152
- [gasps]

1:31:14.385 --> 1:31:15.884
We're not dead.

1:31:16.019 --> 1:31:18.418
- Not yet.

1:31:20.484 --> 1:31:21.484
- Where are we?

1:31:21.551 --> 1:31:23.818
- It's just an illusion.

1:31:38.017 --> 1:31:40.183
- What about them?

1:31:42.017 --> 1:31:47.915
[eerie clicking]

1:31:51.416 --> 1:31:56.148
- [grunts softly]

1:31:56.215 --> 1:31:58.880
[groans]

1:32:03.348 --> 1:32:06.048
If we don't come up with a way
to get this wolfsbane out soon,

1:32:06.115 --> 1:32:09.714
I'm going to die.

1:32:09.780 --> 1:32:11.647
We need to find Liam.

1:32:11.713 --> 1:32:13.014
- Your beta?

1:32:13.080 --> 1:32:15.646
- My friend.

1:32:15.713 --> 1:32:17.413
Liam and Hikari.

1:32:17.479 --> 1:32:19.179
- She's a kitsune.

1:32:19.246 --> 1:32:22.046
That's why that arrow
didn't do anything to her.

1:32:22.113 --> 1:32:23.912
- Because of the fox.

1:32:24.013 --> 1:32:26.113
It protects her, like armor.

1:32:26.179 --> 1:32:28.612
- It won't protect her
from the Oni.

1:32:28.678 --> 1:32:30.345
- Nothing protected you either.

1:32:33.012 --> 1:32:35.278
- What do you mean?
- You died in my arms.

1:32:38.078 --> 1:32:41.177
And if you let me,
I could prove it to you.

1:32:43.444 --> 1:32:45.511
- [whispering]
You're lying.

1:32:45.577 --> 1:32:48.011
- Just give me a chance.

1:32:50.311 --> 1:32:55.776
If you still
don't believe me, fine.

1:32:55.843 --> 1:32:58.010
Let me die.

1:32:59.143 --> 1:33:01.043
- And what if I do?

1:33:01.110 --> 1:33:03.409
- Well, then you're gonna
have to save me.

1:33:05.909 --> 1:33:07.609
- [strained yelling]

1:33:07.675 --> 1:33:10.309
- Derek, I'm not so sure
even your strength

1:33:10.375 --> 1:33:13.109
could break those bonds,
not here.

1:33:13.175 --> 1:33:14.408
- Eli, are you OK?

1:33:14.474 --> 1:33:16.009
How's your leg?

1:33:16.042 --> 1:33:17.541
- Yeah, it's fine.

1:33:17.608 --> 1:33:19.008
It's healed.

1:33:19.008 --> 1:33:20.074
- You learn how to heal?

1:33:20.141 --> 1:33:21.141
- Yeah, kind of.

1:33:21.208 --> 1:33:22.673
Well, Scott did most of it.

1:33:22.740 --> 1:33:24.807
- That's amazing!

1:33:24.873 --> 1:33:26.307
- Hey, Derek.

1:33:26.373 --> 1:33:27.440
Maybe you want to be
a little more subtle

1:33:27.507 --> 1:33:30.207
with your antics.
- [eerie clicking]

1:33:30.273 --> 1:33:33.606
- The Nogitsune isn't gonna
kill us, not yet.

1:33:33.672 --> 1:33:36.572
He put us here to watch him win.

1:33:36.639 --> 1:33:38.506
We're here for our pain.

1:33:43.206 --> 1:33:44.871
- Do you guys hear that?

1:33:45.006 --> 1:33:49.605
[distant pounding]

1:33:49.671 --> 1:33:51.738
- It sounds like--

1:33:51.805 --> 1:33:53.438
- Lacrosse.

1:33:56.105 --> 1:33:57.471
[whistle blasts]

1:33:57.537 --> 1:33:59.271
[players grunt]

1:34:10.337 --> 1:34:12.004
- At least we know
she hasn't caught him yet.

1:34:12.004 --> 1:34:14.169
- No, she's caught him.

1:34:14.236 --> 1:34:16.569
Allison knows to retrieve
her arrows whenever she can.

1:34:16.636 --> 1:34:19.003
This was left so we're
following the right trail.

1:34:19.069 --> 1:34:20.602
- Guys.

1:34:20.668 --> 1:34:23.036
[distant cheering]

1:34:23.103 --> 1:34:25.268
I don't think
we're following a trail.

1:34:25.335 --> 1:34:27.702
We're being led into a trap,
and I think that's it.

1:34:27.768 --> 1:34:29.002
It's the college stadium.

1:34:29.068 --> 1:34:31.135
That's where the lacrosse
tournament's being held.

1:34:31.202 --> 1:34:32.601
- And while they play
a lacrosse game,

1:34:32.667 --> 1:34:36.534
we'll be playing right
into the Nogitsune's game.

1:34:36.601 --> 1:34:38.834
That's where he'll make
his final moves.

1:34:38.901 --> 1:34:41.001
Let's just hope he hasn't
figured out a divine move.

1:34:41.001 --> 1:34:42.167
- What's that?

1:34:42.234 --> 1:34:43.633
- It's a move in the game of Go.

1:34:43.700 --> 1:34:48.101
- It's a move so brilliant,
so inspired,

1:34:48.166 --> 1:34:49.633
that it changes the shape
of the entire game.

1:34:49.700 --> 1:34:53.633
A move that only a god
could make.

1:34:53.699 --> 1:34:55.200
Divine.

1:35:00.565 --> 1:35:02.799
- I think the accelerant
used to start these fires

1:35:02.865 --> 1:35:06.065
might be the same one used to
start a fire over 20 years ago.

1:35:06.132 --> 1:35:08.764
- Are you talking about the fire
that killed Derek's family?

1:35:08.831 --> 1:35:11.531
- And there's one more thing.

1:35:11.598 --> 1:35:14.731
The person who came up with this
formula is supposed to be dead.

1:35:14.798 --> 1:35:16.298
- "Supposed to be dead"
is starting to be

1:35:16.364 --> 1:35:17.998
a recurring theme around here.

1:35:18.031 --> 1:35:24.430
[players shouting in distance]

1:35:31.796 --> 1:35:34.696
[eerie music]

1:35:34.762 --> 1:35:39.029
* *

1:35:42.595 --> 1:35:45.261
- Just...hold on.

1:35:46.761 --> 1:35:48.628
Please.

1:35:48.695 --> 1:35:53.361
[grunting]

1:35:58.160 --> 1:35:59.794
It's my license.

1:36:08.094 --> 1:36:10.693
It was at the ice rink.

1:36:10.759 --> 1:36:11.993
The other pictures
didn't come out

1:36:12.026 --> 1:36:14.858
so I tore that one off for you.

1:36:14.993 --> 1:36:16.825
After you died,

1:36:16.892 --> 1:36:20.126
your father gave that to me.

1:36:23.125 --> 1:36:25.891
- Lydia was there.

1:36:25.992 --> 1:36:27.492
- And Stiles.

1:36:29.824 --> 1:36:32.357
Remember the winter formal?

1:36:35.057 --> 1:36:36.991
- I went with my friends,

1:36:37.057 --> 1:36:40.124
Jackson and Lydia.

1:36:40.191 --> 1:36:42.856
I don't remember anybody else.

1:36:42.991 --> 1:36:44.790
- I was there.

1:36:46.690 --> 1:36:50.622
And I found you inside,
and we danced.

1:36:54.190 --> 1:36:56.489
- I don't remember any of that.

1:36:58.655 --> 1:37:00.655
- We kissed.

1:37:03.255 --> 1:37:06.288
And that was the first time
I told you that I loved you.

1:37:09.488 --> 1:37:11.753
- Why did you do that?

1:37:12.254 --> 1:37:14.288
- Because I love you.

1:37:15.587 --> 1:37:16.787
When you broke up with me,

1:37:16.853 --> 1:37:21.852
I said I knew we were
gonna be together.

1:37:21.987 --> 1:37:25.153
And you told me...

1:37:25.220 --> 1:37:27.652
"There's no such thing as fate."

1:37:31.486 --> 1:37:34.519
Do you remember what
I told you back?

1:37:40.685 --> 1:37:42.618
- "There's no such thing
as a werewolf."

1:37:43.718 --> 1:37:45.485
- [sighs]

1:37:48.118 --> 1:37:49.617
- Tell me the rest.

1:37:49.684 --> 1:37:52.884
- I can't, because I'm going
to die if you don't help me.

1:37:52.985 --> 1:37:55.184
- What do I have to do?

1:37:55.250 --> 1:37:58.150
- Wolfsbane only responds
to fire.

1:37:58.217 --> 1:38:01.783
You've got to burn it out.

1:38:03.984 --> 1:38:10.283
- A man looks at a photograph
of another man.

1:38:10.349 --> 1:38:15.248
He says, "Brothers and sisters
have I none.

1:38:15.315 --> 1:38:21.681
But this man's father
is my father's son."

1:38:25.581 --> 1:38:28.247
Who is the man
in the photograph?

1:38:28.314 --> 1:38:29.714
- My son.

1:38:29.781 --> 1:38:31.347
- Ah.

1:38:36.247 --> 1:38:37.981
- Don't be afraid.

1:38:38.014 --> 1:38:40.713
- Oh, of this guy? No, no way.

1:38:40.780 --> 1:38:44.413
Oh, my God, he's touching me.
[groans]

1:38:44.480 --> 1:38:48.313
- The son of Derek Hale.

1:38:48.379 --> 1:38:53.779
But not a wolf yet, is he?

1:38:53.845 --> 1:38:56.312
When night falls,

1:38:56.379 --> 1:39:00.744
he may earn his fangs,
his claws,

1:39:00.811 --> 1:39:03.178
watching the rest of you die!
- [shouts]

1:39:03.244 --> 1:39:04.978
- [roars]

1:39:16.876 --> 1:39:18.410
- Whoa, uh...

1:39:18.477 --> 1:39:22.143
you couldn't find a lighter?

1:39:22.210 --> 1:39:25.043
- Do you want to live or not?

1:39:26.142 --> 1:39:28.176
- [sighs] Burn it out.

1:39:28.242 --> 1:39:30.376
[groans softly]

1:39:33.042 --> 1:39:35.109
[tense music]

1:39:35.176 --> 1:39:38.441
[thunderous pounding]

1:39:39.275 --> 1:39:43.975
[breathing heavily]

1:39:44.008 --> 1:39:47.774
[groaning]

1:39:47.840 --> 1:39:52.574
[screaming]

1:39:54.374 --> 1:39:57.839
[scream echoing]

1:40:00.107 --> 1:40:02.606
- [snarls]

1:40:07.239 --> 1:40:08.838
- Eli, did you see that?

1:40:08.905 --> 1:40:10.405
Did you see your eyes?

1:40:10.472 --> 1:40:11.505
- How the hell am I supposed
to see my eyes?

1:40:11.572 --> 1:40:12.705
They're the things I use to see.

1:40:12.772 --> 1:40:14.938
- They were glowing.
- What?

1:40:15.005 --> 1:40:16.138
They were?
- Yes.

1:40:16.205 --> 1:40:18.571
- [roars]

1:40:20.105 --> 1:40:21.437
- Oh.

1:40:21.504 --> 1:40:23.137
- Wait, don't!

1:40:23.204 --> 1:40:24.204
- [grunts]

1:40:24.271 --> 1:40:27.937
- Tell me, Eli,

1:40:28.004 --> 1:40:29.570
do you like riddles?

1:40:29.636 --> 1:40:30.903
- I'm more of a limerick
kind of guy.

1:40:30.971 --> 1:40:33.470
You know, I like the rhyming.
[grunts]

1:40:34.836 --> 1:40:37.836
- Finstock, thanks for
reminding everyone here

1:40:37.902 --> 1:40:40.835
that no team chokes
quite like Beacon Hills.

1:40:40.902 --> 1:40:42.003
- We're still up, Hogan.

1:40:43.702 --> 1:40:44.635
Shit!

1:40:47.169 --> 1:40:49.402
- [grunts]

1:40:50.335 --> 1:40:51.502
- I need to find my father.

1:40:51.569 --> 1:40:53.701
If he's here,
he's in danger too.

1:40:55.102 --> 1:40:58.468
- Allison, wait.

1:40:58.534 --> 1:41:02.833
Look, this isn't
just about us anymore.

1:41:03.667 --> 1:41:06.068
- I think I remember you,

1:41:06.134 --> 1:41:07.600
or maybe someone like you,

1:41:07.667 --> 1:41:09.400
maybe someone
I was in love with.

1:41:09.467 --> 1:41:12.467
And maybe--
maybe if I had more time,

1:41:12.533 --> 1:41:13.967
I would remember everything.

1:41:14.033 --> 1:41:16.799
But I can't help you right now.
I have to find my father.

1:41:16.866 --> 1:41:20.067
I think he might be
the only one I have left.

1:41:20.133 --> 1:41:21.599
- Yeah.

1:41:31.199 --> 1:41:36.731
- Let's put one of the players
back in the game.

1:41:36.797 --> 1:41:38.965
- No!
- [shouting]

1:41:39.031 --> 1:41:42.065
[grunting]

1:41:57.529 --> 1:42:00.728
- Allison.
Hey! Allison, Allison.

1:42:00.795 --> 1:42:02.229
They don't know that it's you.

1:42:02.296 --> 1:42:04.196
Not even your own father.

1:42:04.263 --> 1:42:06.828
So just...

1:42:06.963 --> 1:42:09.495
be careful.

1:42:09.562 --> 1:42:11.328
- I just tried to kill you,

1:42:11.395 --> 1:42:14.727
and you're telling me
to be careful.

1:42:14.794 --> 1:42:16.427
Why would you do that?

1:42:20.427 --> 1:42:23.394
- Because I'm still in love
with you.

1:42:25.961 --> 1:42:27.393
- [chuckles]

1:42:34.960 --> 1:42:37.426
[whistle blasts]

1:42:37.492 --> 1:42:38.725
- Eli!

1:42:38.792 --> 1:42:40.960
Where the hell
did you come from?

1:42:41.026 --> 1:42:42.259
Get off the--hey!

1:42:42.325 --> 1:42:43.859
[whistles]
Off the field!

1:42:43.959 --> 1:42:46.724
Get off the field! Look at you!

1:42:46.791 --> 1:42:47.959
- Eli?

1:42:52.558 --> 1:42:54.959
- It's happening now.

1:42:54.991 --> 1:42:57.424
The mountain ash is more
than a barrier.

1:42:57.491 --> 1:42:59.258
It's a gateway between
his world and ours.

1:42:59.324 --> 1:43:02.423
- Oh, I really hate when you
say shit like that.

1:43:02.490 --> 1:43:04.657
Isn't it just ash?

1:43:08.690 --> 1:43:10.622
- Parrish has to break
the barrier.

1:43:10.689 --> 1:43:12.090
He's the only one
that can do it.

1:43:12.157 --> 1:43:14.223
[gasps]

1:43:14.290 --> 1:43:16.389
Jackson.

1:43:16.957 --> 1:43:19.656
- OK, so it's a place,
but it's not real.

1:43:19.722 --> 1:43:21.122
They're all there with my dad,

1:43:21.189 --> 1:43:23.089
and they're alive.
- This part of the game?

1:43:23.156 --> 1:43:24.655
It's like he's knocking
pieces off the board.

1:43:24.721 --> 1:43:26.089
- So how come he put me
back on it?

1:43:26.156 --> 1:43:27.255
- I don't know, but I need to
get you out of here.

1:43:27.321 --> 1:43:28.721
Come on.

1:43:28.788 --> 1:43:31.655
- Oh! What the hell was that?

1:43:31.721 --> 1:43:33.588
- Mountain ash.

1:43:35.388 --> 1:43:38.287
[unsettling music]

1:43:38.354 --> 1:43:43.954
* *

1:43:43.954 --> 1:43:45.619
- It's him.

1:43:45.686 --> 1:43:46.987
It's really him.

1:43:47.054 --> 1:43:48.954
- It's him who?

1:43:48.954 --> 1:43:50.954
- Adrian Harris.

1:43:50.954 --> 1:43:52.786
- He kind of looks like
our chemistry teacher.

1:43:52.853 --> 1:43:55.019
- I was your chemistry teacher,
Jackson,

1:43:55.086 --> 1:43:56.253
you fucking imbecile.

1:43:56.319 --> 1:43:57.953
[gunshot]
- [grunts]

1:43:57.986 --> 1:44:01.518
- Do it. Scream, Lydia.
Scream like a banshee.

1:44:01.585 --> 1:44:02.718
Oh. Oh, that's right.

1:44:02.785 --> 1:44:05.452
You haven't screamed in years,
have you?

1:44:05.518 --> 1:44:06.452
- What do you want from us?

1:44:06.518 --> 1:44:08.552
- Well, I don't want an apology,

1:44:08.617 --> 1:44:09.985
seeing as how
you ruined my life,

1:44:10.052 --> 1:44:11.784
and you served me up
as a human sacrifice

1:44:11.851 --> 1:44:13.052
to some demented druid.

1:44:13.118 --> 1:44:15.317
- I was in London
for all of that.

1:44:15.384 --> 1:44:18.617
[gunshot]
- [groaning]

1:44:19.951 --> 1:44:21.550
- The sun's going down.

1:44:21.616 --> 1:44:22.750
If the Oni come out at night--

1:44:22.816 --> 1:44:24.750
- There's 10,000 people
in this stadium.

1:44:24.816 --> 1:44:26.116
What are we supposed to do?

1:44:26.183 --> 1:44:27.550
- Come on.

1:44:27.616 --> 1:44:28.816
Hey, Coach?

1:44:28.950 --> 1:44:29.983
- Come on.
- Coach!

1:44:30.050 --> 1:44:31.150
Coach, hey!

1:44:31.216 --> 1:44:32.283
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

1:44:32.350 --> 1:44:33.482
Unacceptable.

1:44:33.549 --> 1:44:34.782
You graduated, McCall.

1:44:34.849 --> 1:44:36.349
You're not ruining this for me.

1:44:36.415 --> 1:44:39.249
- Coach, every single person
in this stadium is in danger.

1:44:39.315 --> 1:44:41.149
Is there any way to get them out
without panicking them?

1:44:41.215 --> 1:44:42.549
- Yeah, you win the game.

1:44:42.615 --> 1:44:44.182
- What happens
if they tie it up?

1:44:44.249 --> 1:44:45.115
- Sudden death.

1:44:45.182 --> 1:44:46.414
- Coach,

1:44:46.481 --> 1:44:47.848
there's gonna be
10,000 sudden deaths

1:44:47.949 --> 1:44:49.982
if we don't stop this game.

1:44:50.048 --> 1:44:52.847
[crowd cheering]

1:44:55.248 --> 1:44:56.381
- Crap!

1:44:56.447 --> 1:44:57.647
I haven't felt this level
of disappointment

1:44:57.713 --> 1:44:59.247
since I lost my virginity.

1:44:59.313 --> 1:45:00.847
You want to help us win, McCall?

1:45:04.147 --> 1:45:06.047
Here.

1:45:12.980 --> 1:45:16.946
Four minutes,
whoever scores first wins.

1:45:16.946 --> 1:45:19.379
- Number 11?
That used to be my number.

1:45:19.446 --> 1:45:20.511
- Do you want it back?

1:45:20.578 --> 1:45:22.278
- No, no. That's OK.

1:45:22.345 --> 1:45:23.678
Just, if you're gonna wear
my number, you better score.

1:45:23.745 --> 1:45:24.946
- I'll try.
[players grunt]

1:45:24.946 --> 1:45:26.478
- Let's go! Let's do it!

1:45:26.545 --> 1:45:28.378
Asses on the field!

1:45:28.445 --> 1:45:31.211
We score first!

1:45:34.045 --> 1:45:36.510
- Come take a look, Lydia.

1:45:36.577 --> 1:45:37.710
- [groans]

1:45:37.777 --> 1:45:39.010
- This was no small
accomplishment.

1:45:39.077 --> 1:45:40.977
This illusion has
several layers.

1:45:41.044 --> 1:45:43.609
Here, Lydia,
let me show you one.

1:45:43.676 --> 1:45:44.944
- You want me to watch
a lacrosse game?

1:45:44.977 --> 1:45:46.476
- No, no.

1:45:46.543 --> 1:45:48.976
I want you to watch
your friends die.

1:45:49.043 --> 1:45:50.509
Come on.

1:45:50.576 --> 1:45:51.643
Take a look through
the microscope.

1:45:51.708 --> 1:45:55.209
- [gasps]

1:45:55.276 --> 1:45:58.943
[eerie clicking]

1:46:01.841 --> 1:46:03.308
- You didn't change.

1:46:05.208 --> 1:46:06.208
- What?

1:46:06.275 --> 1:46:07.341
- When they took Eli,

1:46:07.407 --> 1:46:09.241
you didn't change.

1:46:09.307 --> 1:46:13.407
- He means you didn't transform
in front of your son.

1:46:13.474 --> 1:46:14.840
- I haven't.

1:46:14.941 --> 1:46:18.673
He hasn't seen me like that.

1:46:18.740 --> 1:46:20.706
Not since the first time.

1:46:20.773 --> 1:46:23.073
- OK, what was the first time?

1:46:23.140 --> 1:46:26.639
- [sighs] I don't know
if he'd even remembers.

1:46:26.705 --> 1:46:28.772
He might have been too young.

1:46:28.839 --> 1:46:30.106
Coyotes had come into the house.

1:46:30.173 --> 1:46:32.739
They clawed through
the screen door.

1:46:32.805 --> 1:46:34.172
Eli was playing on the floor,

1:46:34.239 --> 1:46:37.838
and they were heading
straight for him.

1:46:37.939 --> 1:46:41.671
I transformed instantly.

1:46:41.738 --> 1:46:44.804
Roared so loud it shook
the entire house.

1:46:44.939 --> 1:46:49.404
Coyotes took off
and there was Eli,

1:46:49.471 --> 1:46:51.238
looking up at me.

1:46:53.971 --> 1:46:56.303
He was shaking.
He was--

1:46:56.370 --> 1:47:00.137
he was terrified.

1:47:00.203 --> 1:47:05.270
And he wouldn't let me
come near him for days.

1:47:05.336 --> 1:47:08.802
That look of fear in his eyes
when he saw me,

1:47:08.937 --> 1:47:11.002
I couldn't get it
out of my head.

1:47:11.069 --> 1:47:14.169
- That's why he can't change.

1:47:14.236 --> 1:47:17.969
- I think every time
he starts to, or...

1:47:18.036 --> 1:47:21.935
maybe every time he tries,

1:47:21.935 --> 1:47:25.368
he must see my face...

1:47:25.435 --> 1:47:27.367
snarling back at him.

1:47:36.699 --> 1:47:38.466
- Get it to McCall! To McCall!

1:47:38.533 --> 1:47:41.067
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1:47:42.266 --> 1:47:44.933
- [grunts]

1:47:46.266 --> 1:47:47.233
[glass shatters]

1:47:47.299 --> 1:47:48.999
Whoa. Sh--

1:47:53.765 --> 1:47:56.398
- I knew the Nogitsune
was too chaotic

1:47:56.465 --> 1:47:58.532
to play this game on his own.

1:47:58.598 --> 1:48:01.398
He needed me to help him win.

1:48:01.464 --> 1:48:03.264
All I had to do was
give him my pain.

1:48:03.331 --> 1:48:05.564
Thanks to you and Scott McCall,

1:48:05.631 --> 1:48:06.731
I have plenty.

1:48:06.797 --> 1:48:09.264
- [grunts]
We all have pain.

1:48:09.331 --> 1:48:12.131
- But Lydia's pain is
particularly appealing

1:48:12.197 --> 1:48:13.630
to a thousand-year-old demon.

1:48:13.696 --> 1:48:15.530
- My pain isn't anything to him.

1:48:15.596 --> 1:48:19.196
- On the contrary, heartbreak
is a veritable delicacy

1:48:19.263 --> 1:48:20.163
to the Nogitsune.

1:48:20.230 --> 1:48:22.930
So give him a taste, Lydia.

1:48:22.963 --> 1:48:24.996
Tell us why you left Stiles.
- [whimpers]

1:48:25.063 --> 1:48:26.462
- Give us your pain,

1:48:26.529 --> 1:48:29.595
or the next time,
I shoot Jackson in the head.

1:48:29.662 --> 1:48:31.029
- No. Lydia.

1:48:31.095 --> 1:48:32.595
Lydia, don't do it.

1:48:32.662 --> 1:48:34.429
Don't do it!

1:48:34.495 --> 1:48:37.428
- I left.

1:48:37.494 --> 1:48:38.728
I left because of a dream.

1:48:38.794 --> 1:48:40.694
- What happened in the dream?

1:48:40.761 --> 1:48:42.261
- My eyes open...

1:48:45.561 --> 1:48:47.928
And I see broken glass.

1:48:51.028 --> 1:48:53.160
It's from a windshield.

1:48:55.660 --> 1:48:59.093
And I'm crawling
on the pavement.

1:49:01.093 --> 1:49:03.960
I'm trying to reach Stiles.

1:49:06.559 --> 1:49:09.426
There was a crash.

1:49:10.825 --> 1:49:14.158
We'd been thrown from the car.

1:49:17.125 --> 1:49:20.425
Except he's not moving.

1:49:21.657 --> 1:49:24.925
He wasn't blinking.

1:49:24.958 --> 1:49:25.925
He wasn't breathing.

1:49:25.991 --> 1:49:28.924
- Lydia, it was just a dream.

1:49:28.990 --> 1:49:31.756
- Until it happened again.

1:49:31.823 --> 1:49:35.656
And again.

1:49:35.723 --> 1:49:39.056
Becomes this recurring dream

1:49:39.123 --> 1:49:41.123
until I can't tell anymore
that if it's a dream--

1:49:41.189 --> 1:49:42.523
- Or a premonition.

1:49:44.023 --> 1:49:45.822
- If I was never in
the car with him,

1:49:45.923 --> 1:49:49.956
there wouldn't have to be
a crash.

1:49:50.022 --> 1:49:52.088
And he wouldn't have to die.

1:49:52.155 --> 1:49:54.522
- And you wouldn't
have to scream.

1:49:54.588 --> 1:49:58.055
- Banshees don't scream.

1:49:59.922 --> 1:50:03.187
They wail.

1:50:05.454 --> 1:50:07.154
- [grunts]

1:50:07.221 --> 1:50:08.387
-[groans]

1:50:09.321 --> 1:50:10.420
- New plan.

1:50:10.486 --> 1:50:11.686
You take the shot.
I'll cover you.

1:50:11.753 --> 1:50:13.220
- Are you kidding?
- No, it's your shot!

1:50:13.286 --> 1:50:14.253
Come on.

1:50:14.320 --> 1:50:15.920
- Where did this kid come from?

1:50:15.986 --> 1:50:18.253
Is he even in high school?

1:50:18.320 --> 1:50:19.652
- That's one of my best
students.

1:50:19.719 --> 1:50:20.920
- He looks like he's 30.

1:50:20.986 --> 1:50:22.419
Who the hell is that?

1:50:23.852 --> 1:50:25.052
- That's Greenberg.

1:50:25.119 --> 1:50:26.851
[crowd cheering distantly]

1:50:26.919 --> 1:50:28.985
- What do you hear?

1:50:29.052 --> 1:50:31.085
- It's like the game's happening
right next to us.

1:50:31.152 --> 1:50:32.952
- I can hear it too.

1:50:33.019 --> 1:50:34.484
I think my son's on the field.

1:50:36.051 --> 1:50:37.884
- Yes! Take it!

1:50:37.951 --> 1:50:40.384
Eli, take it to the rack!

1:50:45.783 --> 1:50:48.450
- [grunts]

1:50:48.517 --> 1:50:51.183
Whoo!

1:50:51.250 --> 1:50:52.517
- Yes!

1:50:52.749 --> 1:50:53.883
- Yes!

1:50:55.749 --> 1:50:57.349
- Holy shit!

1:50:57.416 --> 1:50:59.049
Scott, did you see that?
Did you me score?

1:50:59.116 --> 1:51:01.249
My dad was actually right.
I'm actually pretty good.

1:51:03.916 --> 1:51:05.916
Oh, my God, my dad.

1:51:05.916 --> 1:51:07.282
- This isn't over.

1:51:07.348 --> 1:51:09.415
- We're gonna find the others.
Come on.

1:51:09.481 --> 1:51:11.515
- Peter! Wait!

1:51:11.581 --> 1:51:12.948
- No! No!

1:51:13.015 --> 1:51:14.148
No more illusions.

1:51:14.215 --> 1:51:16.747
- Where's Scott? Where's my son?

1:51:16.814 --> 1:51:18.081
- He's on the field.

1:51:18.148 --> 1:51:19.780
He's trying to save everyone.

1:51:19.915 --> 1:51:21.214
He's playing the game.

1:51:21.280 --> 1:51:23.114
- That most definitely
sounds like your son.

1:51:23.180 --> 1:51:24.547
But as for your daughter--

1:51:24.614 --> 1:51:26.514
- I forgot to tell you
something, Peter.

1:51:26.580 --> 1:51:28.779
The arrow wasn't the only thing
Allison left behind.

1:51:47.412 --> 1:51:50.512
- You think I wouldn't recognize
my own daughter?

1:51:50.577 --> 1:51:52.411
It is you.

1:51:52.477 --> 1:51:54.012
- I don't know.

1:51:54.078 --> 1:51:56.078
I don't know who or what I am.

1:51:56.144 --> 1:51:57.677
But my friends are in trouble
and it's all my fault.

1:51:57.744 --> 1:51:59.111
- No.

1:52:02.776 --> 1:52:04.676

- The real tournament begins.

1:52:26.808 --> 1:52:28.741
- Where are we?

1:52:28.808 --> 1:52:30.708
- We're in his world.

1:52:34.674 --> 1:52:35.974
- This is it.

1:52:36.041 --> 1:52:38.740
They're here.
They're all trapped here.

- Something's happening.

You've done it before.

1:53:31.703 --> 1:53:33.203
- That was years ago.

1:53:33.269 --> 1:53:34.236
The amount of power
this is gonna take,

1:53:34.303 --> 1:53:36.136
I don't know if I can do it.

1:53:36.203 --> 1:53:37.936
- OK. What do you need?

1:53:38.003 --> 1:53:39.136
You need a pep talk?

1:53:39.202 --> 1:53:41.502
One of those "you can do this"
speeches?

1:53:41.568 --> 1:53:44.902
I don't do speeches.
I don't do pep talks.

1:53:44.902 --> 1:53:46.435
I'm not here to boost your ego.

1:53:46.502 --> 1:53:47.902
And I'm not gonna be
your cheerleader.

1:53:47.968 --> 1:53:50.201
So whatever you need to do
to get your shit together,

1:53:50.267 --> 1:53:51.367
you gotta do this for yourself

1:53:51.434 --> 1:53:54.201
and you gotta do this right now.

1:53:54.267 --> 1:53:57.267
You are a hellhound
that burns hellfire.

1:53:57.334 --> 1:53:59.234
Now burn this fucker up!

1:54:01.666 --> 1:54:05.700

1:54:05.766 --> 1:54:10.665
[roaring]

- We can't get loose.

1:54:24.199 --> 1:54:26.264
[indistinct]
- Dad.

1:54:26.331 --> 1:54:28.164
- Parrish, we need to
buy him more time.

1:54:28.231 --> 1:54:29.431
- Go ahead, Lydia.

1:54:29.498 --> 1:54:31.531
Watch your friends suffer.

1:54:31.598 --> 1:54:33.630
- [grunts]

1:54:36.730 --> 1:54:38.697

- Fight, Allison. Come on.

1:54:54.929 --> 1:54:56.628
- She'll hear you.

1:54:56.695 --> 1:54:58.896
Mountain ash doesn't work
on banshees.

1:55:21.160 --> 1:55:24.493
- Allison is alive.

1:55:24.559 --> 1:55:26.559
Your best friend is alive,

1:55:26.626 --> 1:55:29.126
and she's out there
fighting for her life.

1:55:29.193 --> 1:55:30.959
Don't lose her again.

1:55:31.026 --> 1:55:34.325
She'll hear you.

1:55:34.392 --> 1:55:37.258
Lydia, she'll hear you.

1:55:37.325 --> 1:55:39.724

I remember.

1:57:41.214 --> 1:57:43.381
I remember everything.

1:57:43.447 --> 1:57:47.746
- We're not done yet.

1:57:47.881 --> 1:57:52.181
The game is mine.

1:57:52.246 --> 1:57:53.746
- [grunts]

1:57:58.346 --> 1:57:59.880
- Take me.

1:57:59.880 --> 1:58:01.479
Let the others go.

1:58:01.545 --> 1:58:05.880
- All the lives here
belong to me.

1:58:05.946 --> 1:58:07.045
- All you need is me.

1:58:07.112 --> 1:58:09.879
- Scott, don't do this.

1:58:09.945 --> 1:58:12.879
- Allison kills me,
I die in her arms,

1:58:12.945 --> 1:58:14.778
the same way that
she died in mine.

1:58:14.879 --> 1:58:16.611
That's the move that wins
the game, isn't it?

1:58:16.678 --> 1:58:19.078
- I've already won.

1:58:19.144 --> 1:58:22.978
You lose!
Until I'm off the board!

1:58:23.044 --> 1:58:24.878
And I'm still standing.

1:58:24.944 --> 1:58:26.244
And I'm still the alpha.

1:58:26.310 --> 1:58:28.643
An arrow to the heart

1:58:28.710 --> 1:58:32.677
to save everyone else?

1:58:32.742 --> 1:58:36.110

- All the other players

1:58:36.177 --> 1:58:38.742

No, I can't.

I--I can't--

1:58:54.541 --> 1:58:56.341
I cannot--no.

1:58:56.408 --> 1:58:58.540
- No. [winces]

1:58:58.607 --> 1:59:01.407
- Kill him, Allison,

1:59:01.474 --> 1:59:04.940
and I win the game.

1:59:05.007 --> 1:59:06.740
- Allison, please.

1:59:06.874 --> 1:59:08.974
Don't make me watch
my friends and my family die.

this isn't over.

2:00:36.532 --> 2:00:38.266
- Scream all you want, Lydia.

2:00:38.332 --> 2:00:40.066
- No!
- The game is over.

2:00:43.431 --> 2:00:47.765
- The wolves howl to
signal their position...

2:00:47.832 --> 2:00:51.065
- [grunts]
- To the rest of the pack.

2:00:51.131 --> 2:00:56.065
Tell me, Scott McCall,

2:00:56.131 --> 2:01:00.130
what is the sound

2:01:00.197 --> 2:01:05.130
of the wolf who is ready to die?

2:01:05.197 --> 2:01:08.230
- I'd tell you,

2:01:08.296 --> 2:01:09.864
but I'm not ready to die.

2:01:29.627 --> 2:01:32.261

The only way we can
break the bonds

2:03:11.353 --> 2:03:13.618
is with our strength combined,
you and me.

2:03:13.685 --> 2:03:15.585
- What strength?
I don't have any strength.

2:03:15.652 --> 2:03:17.118

We do it together.

2:04:26.880 --> 2:04:29.846
the gift that you gave me?

He's too strong.

We have to break the illusion.

2:10:47.213 --> 2:10:49.213
* Lonely is the night *

2:10:49.279 --> 2:10:51.213
* Lonely is the night time *

2:10:51.279 --> 2:10:54.146
* Lonely is the night *

2:10:54.213 --> 2:10:56.678
* Satellite, satellite *

2:10:56.745 --> 2:10:59.178
- Lydia.
- Allison!

2:11:00.813 --> 2:11:02.812
- * Bring me home *

2:11:02.812 --> 2:11:08.311
* Satellite, satellite *

2:11:08.377 --> 2:11:12.812
* Cause I feel you
around me always *

2:11:12.877 --> 2:11:16.811
* I feel you around me always *

2:11:16.844 --> 2:11:21.543

looking down *

2:11:39.574 --> 2:11:43.608
- The first night
I met Derek Hale,

2:11:43.674 --> 2:11:44.708
he saved my life.

2:11:47.441 --> 2:11:49.808
Then he said we were brothers,

2:11:49.874 --> 2:11:54.208
and I thought that he was crazy.

2:11:54.273 --> 2:11:57.407
But no. No, he was right.

2:11:59.573 --> 2:12:03.240
Eli, from that moment on,
we were brothers.

2:12:04.807 --> 2:12:06.706
And, uh...

2:12:06.807 --> 2:12:10.272
Derek Hale was the first person
to teach me that

2:12:10.339 --> 2:12:14.638
you don't just get the family
that you were born with.

2:12:16.538 --> 2:12:18.471
You get the family
that you find.

2:12:21.371 --> 2:12:23.005
- You know, I'm not sure
how your dad would feel

2:12:23.071 --> 2:12:24.538
about me giving you the Jeep.

2:12:24.605 --> 2:12:29.304
But, um, something tells me
it's the right thing to do.

2:12:29.370 --> 2:12:31.270
- He hated that Jeep.

2:12:31.337 --> 2:12:33.670
- After my son left it behind,

2:12:33.805 --> 2:12:37.504
Derek towed it in, thinking it
was probably beyond repair.

2:12:37.569 --> 2:12:39.503
But then he opened up the hood
and he pulled off

2:12:39.569 --> 2:12:42.804
all the duct tape
Stiles had stuck on it.

2:12:42.837 --> 2:12:44.669
And he managed to fix it.

2:12:44.804 --> 2:12:46.469
- [chuckles softly]

2:12:46.536 --> 2:12:48.568
- That Jeep,

2:12:48.635 --> 2:12:51.003
no matter
what's been done to it,

2:12:51.069 --> 2:12:53.635
it just keeps running.

2:12:53.702 --> 2:12:56.702
He could never figure out
why it wouldn't break down

2:12:56.803 --> 2:13:00.168
and stay down.

2:13:00.235 --> 2:13:01.467
And I don't think
he ever realized that

2:13:01.534 --> 2:13:04.301
that's exactly
the way we saw him.

2:13:04.367 --> 2:13:07.567
I have never seen anyone

2:13:07.634 --> 2:13:10.801
take the kind of punishment
that Derek Hale took...

2:13:10.867 --> 2:13:12.101
[electrical buzzing]

2:13:13.801 --> 2:13:15.600
And kept taking...

2:13:16.867 --> 2:13:18.666
In order to protect
the people he loved.

2:13:18.801 --> 2:13:21.666
[somber music]

2:13:21.800 --> 2:13:28.665

2:13:43.964 --> 2:13:45.598
[roars]

2:13:45.663 --> 2:13:48.331
- He kept standing back up...

2:13:54.863 --> 2:14:00.197
- [roaring]

2:14:02.930 --> 2:14:06.796
- Until the day he couldn't.

2:14:06.829 --> 2:14:08.429
Hey.

2:14:08.496 --> 2:14:12.628
Your dad had complicated
feelings about that Jeep.

2:14:12.695 --> 2:14:16.095
But it doesn't mean it needs
to be complicated for you.

2:14:16.161 --> 2:14:19.795
All you got to do...

2:14:19.828 --> 2:14:22.228
is keep it running.

2:14:22.295 --> 2:14:24.895
Just keep it going.

2:14:24.961 --> 2:14:27.960
- * We are victims
of the night *

2:14:28.027 --> 2:14:34.127

2:14:34.194 --> 2:14:37.794
* We are victims of the night *

2:14:37.794 --> 2:14:44.793

2:14:54.158 --> 2:14:57.457
[dogs barking]

2:14:57.524 --> 2:14:59.624
- Don't get too attached.

2:14:59.792 --> 2:15:01.157
- [chuckles]

2:15:01.224 --> 2:15:03.792
- We got adoptions on Saturday.

2:15:03.792 --> 2:15:05.024
- Eventually him.

2:15:05.091 --> 2:15:06.391
- I know you're gonna be
tempted,

2:15:06.457 --> 2:15:08.991
but not a lot of treats.
He's still growing dog.

2:15:09.057 --> 2:15:10.924
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

2:15:10.991 --> 2:15:12.156
- He's pretty heavy already.

2:15:12.223 --> 2:15:14.123
- When he's ready.

2:15:14.190 --> 2:15:15.590
Hi.

2:15:20.123 --> 2:15:21.655
- I have this feeling.

2:15:21.790 --> 2:15:24.255
It's like,
all this time has passed

2:15:24.322 --> 2:15:26.790
and I want to figure out
how to get it back.

2:15:27.489 --> 2:15:29.022
Like, I'm happy for everything
that's ahead of me,

2:15:29.089 --> 2:15:32.189
but I--I just--

2:15:32.255 --> 2:15:36.121
I feel this kind of regret,
you know?

2:15:36.188 --> 2:15:38.789
I think--

2:15:38.789 --> 2:15:40.388
I think I feel...

2:15:42.388 --> 2:15:44.420
- Wistful.

2:15:46.988 --> 2:15:48.520
- Yeah, that's exactly it.

2:15:51.287 --> 2:15:53.420
Do you feel that way?

2:15:56.887 --> 2:15:58.820
- No.

2:16:00.787 --> 2:16:04.152
I'm not worried about the past,

2:16:04.219 --> 2:16:08.351
because now I have a future.

2:16:08.418 --> 2:16:10.952
With him.

2:16:11.019 --> 2:16:12.651
And you.

2:16:13.818 --> 2:16:15.085
- [chuckles]

[soft romantic music]

2:16:19.918 --> 2:16:22.450
[dogs howling]

2:16:22.517 --> 2:16:25.917

2:16:25.984 --> 2:16:32.784
* *

2:16:45.448 --> 2:16:48.248
- Why did we stop?

2:16:48.315 --> 2:16:50.448
Hey, I thought--I thought
I was gonna go see my lawyer.

Whoa, whoa, hey!
No, hey!

Hey, come on!
Get your hands off--

2:17:22.145 --> 2:17:23.679
- Good evening, Mr. Harris.

2:17:23.779 --> 2:17:25.512
There's been a change of plans.

2:17:25.578 --> 2:17:27.478
It's been decided that
you'll be placed at

2:17:27.544 --> 2:17:29.912
a far more suitable
detention facility.

2:17:29.979 --> 2:17:31.244
- What kind of facility?

2:17:31.311 --> 2:17:33.444
- The Eichen.
- [groans]

2:17:33.511 --> 2:17:35.144
- I think you'll be
very comfortable there.

2:17:35.211 --> 2:17:36.578
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

2:17:36.643 --> 2:17:39.278
No, God! No, no, no! No!

2:17:39.344 --> 2:17:41.211
No! It's some kind of mistake!

2:17:41.277 --> 2:17:43.377
No! I'm a high school teacher!

2:17:43.443 --> 2:17:45.243
Come on, the kids,
the teenagers,

2:17:45.310 --> 2:17:46.943
they're werewolves!

2:17:47.010 --> 2:17:49.110
- Trust me.

2:17:49.177 --> 2:17:52.476
We've heard plenty of stories
about teenage werewolves.

2:17:54.576 --> 2:17:56.509
There's always a new one.
